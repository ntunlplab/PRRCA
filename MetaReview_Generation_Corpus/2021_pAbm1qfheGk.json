Q2 : A bit more precise description about the force-fields algorithms in RDKit is needed . A2 : In MMFF , the energy expression is constituted by seven terms : bond stretching , angle bending , stretch-bend , out-of-plane bending , torsional , van der Waals and electrostatic . The detailed functional form of individual terms can be found in the original literature . To build the force field for a given molecular system , the first step is to assign correct types to each atom . At the second step , atom-centered partial charges are computed according to the MMFF charge model . Then , all bonded and non-bonded interactions in the molecular system under study , depending on its structure and connectivity , are loaded into the energy expression . Optionally , external restraining terms can be added to the MMFF energy expression , with the purpose of constraining selected internal coordinates during geometry optimizations . Once all bonded and non-bonded interactions , plus optional restraints , have been loaded into the MMFF energy expression , potential gradients of the system under study can be computed to minimize the energy . We have added the above detailed description of the MMFF force field algorithm in the updated version . Q3 : From results in Table 2 , CGCF combined with the ETM component does work better than GraphDG , although the authors state that it is because of the sharpness of the distance distribution . Clear justifications should be given to show the benefits , if any , of this phenomenon . A3 : 1.Tab.2 shows that generally CFCF+ETM works better than GraphDG , but worse than CGCF itself . Here we give a discussion about why ETM will slightly hurt the performance and its benefits : This phenomenon is natural because typically ETM will sharpen the generated distribution towards the stable conformations with local minimal energy . By contrast , the ISO17 dataset consists of snapshots of molecular dynamics where the structures are not equilibrium conformations but samples from the density around the equilibrium state . Therefore , ETM will slightly hurt the results . Actually this phenomenon is also consistent with the observations for RDKit . Instead of generating unbiased samples from the underlying distribution , RDKit will also generate the stable ones with local minimal energy by involving the hand-designed molecular force field ( Simm et al . ) . And as shown in the results , though highly competitive in Tab.1 , RDKit also suffers much weaker results in Tab.2 . Therefore , similarly to RDKit , the benefits of the sharpness of the generated distribution can be found in Tab.1 , where ETM can obviously boost the performance of CGCF by generating more stable conformations . We have refined our statement and added the above discussion in the updated version . 2.We also follow Mansimov et al.to add a new experiment to measure the diversity of generated conformations . The results are measured by calculating the mean and standard deviation of the pairwise RMSD between each pair of generated conformations per molecule . The results are summarized as follows : Metric & RDKit & CVGAE & GraphDG & CGCF & CGCF+ETM Mean & 0.083 & 0.207 & 0.249 & 0.810 & 0.741 Std & 0.054 & 0.187 & 0.104 & 0.223 & 0.206 We can observe that ETM will slightly hurt the diversity of CGCF , which verifies our statement that ETM will sharpen the generated distribution towards the stable conformations with local minimal energy . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; Reference : ( Simm et al . ) Simm G N C , Hern\u00e1ndez-Lobato J M.

The response to your concerns are listed below : Q1 : While the model performs better than neural baselines , it does not yet approach RDKit , which is based on expert knowledge features . This means the proposed model is not yet practically useful . A1 : 1.As also claimed in Simm et al. , methods such as RDKit just aim to produce a low-energy conformation , not to generate unbiased samples from the underlying distribution at a certain temperature . By contrast , our deep generative models can model the underlying distribution and generate samples from it . This advantage can be observed from distribution Tab 2 , where both GraphDG and our method can outperform RDKit with a significant margin . 2.Besides , on the large molecule dataset Drugs , when combined with the force field ( FF ) , our method achieved very good results ( COV 92.41 and MAT 0.77 ) , which is much better than RDKit .

Because the molecules in Drugs are much larger and challenging , actually these results are more convincing than the results on the QM9 dataset where the improvement is marginal . Secondly , on the QM9 dataset , though the improvement of our method is kind of limited , FF still boosts the performance of our method , which still outperforms the baselines . And the improvement of FF for other models ( CVGAE and GraphDG ) are still obvious . Thus we draw the conclusion in the paper that : 1 ) FF plays a vital role in generating more realistic structures , and 2 ) our method has a strong capacity to generate high-quality initial coordinates ."}, {"review_id": "pAbm1qfheGk-2", "review_text": "This paper presents an approach to generate diverse small molecule conformations given its graph by combining a conditional flow-based model with an energy-based model .

Can the authors report a statistic over the generated distribution ( instead of over the test set ) ? A1 : This is a great point ! We have added two experiments in the updated version to address your concern . 1.Since the COV and MAT score do not appear to explicitly measure the generated false samples , we additionally define * * Junk * * rate measurement . Intuitively , JUNK measures the fraction of generated conformations that are far away from all the conformations in the reference set . For each conformation in the generated set , it will be marked as a false sample if its RMSD to all the conformations of the reference set are above a given threshold . Typically , a lower JUNK rate means better generated quality .

The results are further improved when combined with ETM to explicitly incorporate the long-range correlations . 2.We follow Mansimov et al.to add a new experiment to measure the diversity of generated conformations , which is a statistic over the generated distribution instead of over the test set . The results ( on ISO17 ) are measured by calculating the mean and standard deviation of the pairwise RMSD between each pair of generated conformations per molecule . The results are summarized as follows : Metric & RDKit & CVGAE & GraphDG & CGCF & CGCF+ETM Mean & 0.083 & 0.207 & 0.249 & 0.810 & 0.741 Std & 0.054 & 0.187 & 0.104 & 0.223 & 0.206 The results demonstrate that while our method can achieve the lowest MMD for distance distribution , it does not collapse to generating extremely similar conformations . Q2 : The abstract/introduction focuses on the computational expense of competing approaches . Can the authors comment on the computationally expense for generating each conformation ? A2 : Actually the computational cost of Molecular Dynamics ( MD ) mentioned in the abstract/introduction is not comparable to deep generative models , including CVGAE , GraphDG and our method . Our deep generative models can generate a conformation in seconds , while the conventional methods typically take several hours to predict a geometry , or even days for larger ones . Q3 : How do the molecular properties of the generated distribution compare to the test distribution ( e.g.small molecule properties in Simm & Hernandez-Lobato Table 2 ) ? A3 : We follow Axelrod et al.to add an experiment on two quantities related to conformational property . In practice , we first pretrain a SchNet for energy prediction , and then take the pretrained model to estimate the energy of conformations generated from different methods . For evaluation , the first quantity is the average conformational energy < E > , which is calculated by averaging the energy of generated conformations for each molecule . And the second quantity is the lowest-energy E_L , which is defined with respect to the lowest-energy conformer for each molecule . Similar to Simm et al. , due to the poor generated quality , we could not compute the properties for CVGAE , and thus this baseline is excluded from this analysis . We calculate the Mean Absolute Error ( MAE ) in energy properties between ground truth and generated conformations from different methods.The results are shown as follows : methods & E_L & < E > RDKit & 0.01255 & 2.60450 GraphDG & 0.01265 & 3.13825 CGCF & 0.01253 & 3.14391 CGCF+ETM & 0.01250 & 3.13799 It can be seen that different methods perform similarly . For the deep generative models , our method can achieve slightly better performance than GraphDG . Q4 : Can the authors clarify if any of the test set molecules from GEOM-QM9 or GEOM-DRUGS are in the training set ? It was unclear from the writing . A4 : No , the training set and test set are totally different .

For each conformation in the generated set , it will be marked as a false sample if its RMSD to all the conformations of the reference set are above a given threshold . Typically , a lower JUNK rate means better generated quality . The results are as follows : Model & QM9-Mean & QM9-Median & Drugs-Mean & Drugs-Median CVGAE & 71.59 & 100.00 & 100.00 & 100.00 GraphDG & 61.25 & 66.26 & 97.83 & 100.00 CGCF & 55.24 & 57.24 & 77.82 & 90.00 CGCF+ETM & 52.15 & 54.23 & 75.81 & 88.64 RDKit & 17.07 & 5.90 & 45.51 & 45.94 CVGAE + FF & 62.92 & 71.21 & 72.01 & 78.44 GraphDG + FF & 45.53 & 46.35 & 55.50 & 61.54 CGCF+FF & 43.01 & 46.69 & 37.48 & 36.63 CGCF+ETM+FF & 41.63 & 43.97 & 36.16 & 33.05 As shown in the table , our CGCF model can already outperform the existing state-of-the-art baselines with an obvious margin . The results are further improved when combined with ETM to explicitly incorporate the long-range correlations . 2.We follow Mansimov et al.to add a new experiment to measure the diversity of generated conformations , which is a statistic over the generated distribution instead of over the test set . The results ( on ISO17 ) are measured by calculating the mean and standard deviation of the pairwise RMSD between each pair of generated conformations per molecule . The results are summarized as follows : Metric & RDKit & CVGAE & GraphDG & CGCF & CGCF+ETM Mean & 0.083 & 0.207 & 0.249 & 0.810 & 0.741 Std & 0.054 & 0.187 & 0.104 & 0.223 & 0.206 The results demonstrate that while our method can achieve the lowest MMD for distance distribution , it does not collapse to generating extremely similar conformations . Q2 : The abstract/introduction focuses on the computational expense of competing approaches . Can the authors comment on the computationally expense for generating each conformation ? A2 : Actually the computational cost of Molecular Dynamics ( MD ) mentioned in the abstract/introduction is not comparable to deep generative models , including CVGAE , GraphDG and our method . Our deep generative models can generate a conformation in seconds , while the conventional methods typically take several hours to predict a geometry , or even days for larger ones . Q3 : How do the molecular properties of the generated distribution compare to the test distribution ( e.g.small molecule properties in Simm & Hernandez-Lobato Table 2 ) ? A3 : We follow Axelrod et al.to add an experiment on two quantities related to conformational property . In practice , we first pretrain a SchNet for energy prediction , and then take the pretrained model to estimate the energy of conformations generated from different methods . For evaluation , the first quantity is the average conformational energy < E > , which is calculated by averaging the energy of generated conformations for each molecule . And the second quantity is the lowest-energy E_L , which is defined with respect to the lowest-energy conformer for each molecule . Similar to Simm et al. , due to the poor generated quality , we could not compute the properties for CVGAE , and thus this baseline is excluded from this analysis . We calculate the Mean Absolute Error ( MAE ) in energy properties between ground truth and generated conformations from different methods.The results are shown as follows : methods & E_L & < E > RDKit & 0.01255 & 2.60450 GraphDG & 0.01265 & 3.13825 CGCF & 0.01253 & 3.14391 CGCF+ETM & 0.01250 & 3.13799 It can be seen that different methods perform similarly . For the deep generative models , our method can achieve slightly better performance than GraphDG . Q4 : Can the authors clarify if any of the test set molecules from GEOM-QM9 or GEOM-DRUGS are in the training set ? It was unclear from the writing . A4 : No , the training set and test set are totally different . We have added these details in the updated version ."}}
