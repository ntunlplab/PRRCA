Overall this is an extension over NetGAN and gives this class of models the ability to utilize extra information when generating graphs.\n\nHowever, all reviewers lean toward the reject side and the concerns raised by the reviewers range from limited novelty to the could-be-improved writing.\n\nI want to highlight two issues.  The first is, is the GAN formulation really necessary?  Could you directly learn using a likelihood objective, e.g. treat the sampled random walks as sequence data, and learn an autoregressive sequence generative model on these data (as a language model for example)?  You could then also generate sample walks from your model.  The benefit is training would be much simpler and more stable.  I believe this could also be related to R2\u2019s concern that the model might be learning the distribution from s alone, as that is entirely possible and potentially easier (not with the GAN formulation proposed here, though).\n\nThe second issue is that I encourage the authors to dig deeper into explainability.  The notion of explainability is obviously important but it is not very well defined.  Does controllability equal explainability?  Is a visualization sufficient to demonstrate explainability (and further, is this sufficient to show this method offers more explainability than alternatives)?  Also intuitively random walk models are not very explainable due to the large amount of randomness in the generation process, compared to e.g. autoregressive graph generative models that generate graphs part-by-part (related to R1\u2019s concern).  If explainability is the main motivation, maybe other alternatives can be more competitive.\n\nOverall I would recommend a reject at this time but encourage the authors to improve the paper further.", "reviews": [{"review_id": "tnq_O52RVbR-0", "review_text": "The paper is clearly written , ideas are well presented , and it is easy to follow the pipeline of the method .

We would like to note that we formulated the problem to explicitly consider node properties , in order to achieve a fine degree of control .

For the potential concern about the generator learning the data distribution directly from the shadow information rather than through the adversarial training , we would like to direct the reviewer 's attention to the generator 's loss function ( Equation 1 ) : $ $ \\mathcal { L } _ { cgan } = \\log ( D ( \\mathbf { x } \\mid \\mathbf { s } ) ) + \\log ( 1 - D ( G ( \\mathbf { z } \\mid \\mathbf { s } ) ) ) $ $ As our conditional model follows the original conditional GAN ( Mirza & Osindero , 2014 ) , the update of the generator only depends on the discriminator 's evaluation of the synthesized conditional random walks . Moreover , the additional shadow information has the exact structure as the original graph , thereby not providing extra information to the model ; it only serves as condition $ \\mathbf { s } $ in the loss function . The primary learning feedback is gained through the adversarial training back-propagation . \\ > > > This paper is similar to NetGAN in terms of both generator and discriminator , and thus , the novelty of this paper is limited .

These properties form the shadow that we control in order to guide the graph generative process . As we are the first to introduce controllable graph generation and graph shadows , these new concepts are best described formally . Hence , we place the problem formulation section early in the paper to introduce the formal definitions as soon as possible . We revised the problem formulation definition to remove any ambiguity and redundancy . \\ > > > While the authors have done a reasonable job to show that their method generates a realistic graph ( which is expected because the core of the method is NetGAN ) when the controlled condition comes from the original data , it is concerning what actually happens when the condition is altered ( e.g. , favoring more links among a certain community ) . It is challenging to measure the effectiveness and the reader has not been convinced yet the proposed method shows advantage . For example , following Figure 3 ( b ) , to generate the effect of `` legal ( red ) internal surge '' , how does the proposed method compare with naively adding random edges to the `` legal '' cluster ? What is missing is a convincing account of why the proposed method makes sense and outperforms others . Response : We thank the reviewer for this observation . While we could naively add random edges , it is not clear if this newly constructed graph follows the dynamics of the original graph . Moreover , even though the random graph could appear to be similar to the original graph , the random edges are not explainable . In contrast , our approach follows a simple and transparent Markov model that provides the needed explainability for generated graphs that are modeled on the original network . We have provided a detailed discussion to support the rationality of our proposed model . Minor comments : \\ > > > Replace Table 1 by Table 3 in the appendix . Standard errors are important . Response : We thank the reviewer for this comment . We have replaced Table 1 with Table 3 to include the standard errors . \\ > > > What the proposed method can control appears to be exogenous of the graph structure ( e.g. , node attributes ) . Hence , it appears unlikely that one can use the graph structure as the controllable condition . For example , I am skeptical that the proposed method can generate a graph that leans toward a desired degree distribution . Response : We thank the reviewer for this comment . We would like to note that we formulated the problem to explicitly consider node properties , in order to achieve a fine degree of control . Nevertheless , our SHADOWCAST is not limited to this fine control . We believe that SHADOWCAST can generate a graph that implicitly leans toward the desired degree distribution by tweaking the Markov model probabilities and specifying the number of edges in the desired graph . However , we recognize that it could be valuable in some cases to use other endogenous properties as an explicit controllable condition . It is a great point , and we thank the reviewer for such insight . We hope to have clarified all reservations . Please feel free to let us know if there any further concerns , and we will do our best to clear your doubts .

Response : We thank the reviewer for this important suggestion . SHADOWCAST is a conditional model that considers auxiliary information ( e.g. , labels , node degree ) of the given graph , on top of learning the graph structure . As more supplementary information becomes available to the model , it acts as a constraint on the model to learn a better representation of the graph . Hence , a conditional model that receives meaningful additional information about the graph should naturally outperform an unconditional model in the same tasks .

Response : We would like to thank the reviewer for raising this point . For the potential concern about the generator learning the data distribution directly from the shadow information rather than through the adversarial training , we would like to direct the reviewer 's attention to the generator 's loss function ( Equation 1 ) : $ $ \\mathcal { L } _ { cgan } = \\log ( D ( \\mathbf { x } \\mid \\mathbf { s } ) ) + \\log ( 1 - D ( G ( \\mathbf { z } \\mid \\mathbf { s } ) ) ) $ $ As our conditional model follows the original conditional GAN ( Mirza & Osindero , 2014 ) , the update of the generator only depends on the discriminator 's evaluation of the synthesized conditional random walks . Moreover , the additional shadow information has the exact structure as the original graph , thereby not providing extra information to the model ; it only serves as condition $ \\mathbf { s } $ in the loss function . The primary learning feedback is gained through the adversarial training back-propagation . \\ > > > This paper is similar to NetGAN in terms of both generator and discriminator , and thus , the novelty of this paper is limited . Response : We thank the reviewer for this remark . We would like to clarify that we are the first to introduce the explainable graph generation problem . We formulate it as generating graphs of user-desired structures through the control of understandable node properties . We proposed a conditional GAN to replace the vanilla GAN that also improves the generative performances on all tasks that the previous methods evaluated . Nevertheless , the goal of SHADOWCAST is not limited to generate graphs that mimic the given graphs . Our proposed approach is designed to be used for investigating the feasibility of graphs under various circumstances that we evaluate in the `` Explaining Generated Graphs '' section . Everything included , we believe that these new applications and explainability demonstrate the novelty of our work . \\ > > > There is a trade-off between the controllability of the graph generation and the quality of the synthesized graph .

Response : We thank the reviewer for this comment . The experiments in Table 1 serve to compare the competitive performance of SHADOWCAST in the typical graph generation task . We demonstrate that SHADOWCAST can generate realistic graphs that mimic the original graphs . Then , in the following `` Explaining Generated Graphs '' section , do we present the controlled graph generation , where we generate graphs of desired structures using a Markov model . The simple Markov model provides us with the needed explainability . We have added insightful discussions in the experiment section to make the distinction clearer .
