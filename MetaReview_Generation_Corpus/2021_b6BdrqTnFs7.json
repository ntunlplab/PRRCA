It also does n't discuss almost at all existing works and mention the only very briefly , making it harder to judge the strength of the new approach as there 's not enough context . In addition , the idea presented feels somewhat too specific to the particular gSCAN task .

The paper proposes to use `` entropy regularization '' as a way to enforce that spurious correlations between input tokens and output actions are not learned . The proposed model shows promising results on the gSCAN benchmark , achieving nearly 100 % accuracy on all but one task . # # # # # # # # Reasons for score : While the paper achieves impressive performance on the synthetic gSCAN dataset , the paper 's framing of the problem , discussion of related work , and description of the model are vague and confusing . As a reviewer , I am left with many questions and confusions about the setup and scope of this paper , and my review depends on clarifications from the authors during the discussion period . # # # # # # # # Strengths : 1 . The paper achieves impressive performance on the gSCAN dataset across all but one task , and describes intuitions on why the remaining task failed . 1.The paper also achieves impressive results on the target length task when compared to existing systems . 1.The proposed model is relatively simple . # # # # # # # # Weaknesses : 1 . My main concern about the paper is its framing of the problem and use of vague terms , especially in the introduction and abstract . See below for more suggestions as well . The paper should be more clear about the scope of compositional generalization it is targeting , especially early in the paper . Specifically , it seems to be targeting novel compositions of attributes and objects in an input instruction . However , there are other dimensions of compositional generalization which the paper does not cover . For example , generalization to new compositions of the environment itself ( i.e. , novel combinations of the objects , attributes , and spatial relations , as evaluated in datasets like ALFRED ( Shridhar et la.2020 ) , Room to Room ( Anderson et al.2018 ) ) , or novel deep compositional structures in the output space ( as in semantic parsing , e.g. , Finegan-Dollak et al.2018 , in comparison to shallow output space compositions such as new manner/direction combinations ) . This paper should clarify the dimensions along which it is evaluating compositional generalization , and contrast that with other forms of compositional generalization . Some other related work which evaluates compositional generalization and are missed include VQA with Changing Priors ( Agrawal et al.2017 ) and CLEVR CoGenT ( Johnson et al.2017 ) .Especially for CLEVR CoGenT , there are several systems which achieve near perfect accuracy on that compositional generalization task , such as NS-VQA ( Yi et al.2019 ) , which are not compared against . 1.The evaluation is only performed on a single synthetic dataset . While it performs well on this benchmark , evaluation on other grounded instruction following tasks , such as some of the examples above , or even on non-instruction tasks such as image question answering , would make the results more convincing . # # # # # # # # Major questions for the authors about the paper setup : 1 . I am confused about where `` entropy regularization '' comes into play in the model . As it is written it seems to be used in two places : ( 1 ) in the actual forward-pass , the only difference is that it adds noise to an input ( and the noise is zero at evaluation time ) , and ( 2 ) during optimization , it also minimizes the L2 norm of these layers ' activations . Is this correct ? 1.In the ablation setting , it 's unclear to me what exactly is being ablated . If EntReg appears both in optimization as L2 regularization and in the forward pass as noise , then are these ablated independently ? What is ERL replaced with when ablated ? And what exactly is NodeOut -- it 's not defined anywhere earlier in the paper , if it is the most critical component of the approach ( as indicated by Table 2 ) , this is concerning . Other clarification questions for the authors : 1 . What is the intuition of the EntReg component actually solving the problem of learning spurious correlations ? How does it actually limit the correlations ( if this is the intent ) between components if it is not considering some relationship between two components ? 1.What does it mean for compositional generalization to require prior knowledge on distribution change ? 1.Am I correct in understanding that the command module will always result in the same output while the agent is acting in the environment ? Nothing about the command module seems to change as it is not conditioned on an environment observation . 1.How does the model know the types and values of the words in the command ? 1.How do `` yellow squares '' and `` red squares '' actually differ in the compositionality they require ? 1.Does `` relatively '' test new attributes that were never seen or referred to during training ? Or just new ways of referring to these attributes ? 1.What 's an example of `` class inference '' ? 1.How is attention evaluated ? Automatically ? # # # # # # # # Suggestions to clarify the presentation of the paper and the approach : 1 . The related work should contrast the proposed approach or evaluation setup with the cited works . E.g. , how does the proposed approach differ from the approaches used on SCAN ? 1 . `` entropy regularization '' is a more general term than it is used in this paper , so I would suggest renaming it . E.g. , it is often used to prevent entropy collapse in reinforcement learning by adding an additional term in the optimization that optimizes for higher entropy output distributions . 1.I am confused about why the term `` entropy '' is used here , because I do n't see the relationship between the function EntReg and entropy ( i.e. , H ( x ) where x is a distribution ) . EntReg here just seems to add some noise to an input x , which is not necessarily a distribution . 1.Several terms are vague/undefined . The term `` component '' is vague without a formal definition of the task being studied . Later on , I am also confused on what `` a change of direction between steps '' means , and why there is a direction , action , and manner . The example in Figure 1 does n't show the output sequences or examples of different manners , and I only have an idea of what `` manner '' means when I read the gSCAN paper or later on in this paper that manner might include spinning , being slow/fast , etc . So , I would suggest , e.g. , showing the actual possible space of outputs . 1.The proposed approach should be described more concretely in the introduction before the results of it are described . 1.Several terms used in the model description are vague and should be defined : what is a `` node '' x_i ( Section 4.1 ) ? What is the difference between ERL and EntReg ( my reading is that ERL is an MLP with EntReg between the layers ) ? What is a `` keyword '' ( as opposed to just a `` word '' ) ? Suggestions on the description of model / results : 1 . The model seems to be described formally three times : in Algorithm 1 , Figure 2 , and Section 4.2 . Its description could be more concise ( e.g. , by removing Algorithm 1 ) . 1.The experiments section should contrast the proposed approach with the baselines/other systems in a meaningful way . 1.I know this is coming from the gSCAN dataset , but the names of the 8 tasks are very confusing . If it 's possible to augment these with a short keyword description that accurately describes the forms of generalization they are evaluating , this would make things a lot easier to read . Particularly , upon reading the results table , the `` yellow squares '' and `` red squares '' settings are n't meaningfully different , and I have no idea what they are testing differently . 1.If Figure 3 is just a bar graph version of Table 1 , it could probably be removed as it is does n't add any information over Table 1 . It 's missing the numbers in the bars , the x-axis is hard to read , and it 's unclear to me whether this is graphing the mean , max , etc . 1.The meaning of $ k $ should be defined before Figure 3 and Table 1 are presented .", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Q6 : What does it mean for compositional generalization to require prior knowledge on distribution change ? A6 : Compositional generalization has multiple components , and the generalization requires recombining values of different components in a novel way . So it requires knowing what are the types of components , such as shape and color , to recombine and generalize . This is what we mean by requiring prior knowledge on distribution change for compositional generalization . It is complicated to discuss whether machines can learn the component types without component specific prior knowledge , and it is beyond the scope of this paper . However , to our best knowledge , many current algorithms have some way to use the prior knowledge . In some cases , the prior knowledge is in the design of data structure ( position and color in image ) . Some approaches design training data distribution to make the components statistically marginally independent . Others design model architectures , regularizations and learning algorithms with the prior knowledge . So here , we discuss different ways to use the prior knowledge to explain the difference between the approaches . Q7 : Am I correct in understanding that the command module will always result in the same output while the agent is acting in the environment ? Nothing about the command module seems to change as it is not conditioned on an environment observation . A7 : Yes.Command module depends only on the command , which does not change while the agent is acting . Q8 : How does the model know the types and values of the words in the command ? A8 : It \u2019 s learnt automatically . We use the prior knowledge that there should be frameworks of types and values ( in design of attention ) , but we do not have sample-wise annotations for them . Q9 : How do `` yellow squares '' and `` red squares '' actually differ in the compositionality they require ? A9 : The required compositionality is the same . The difference is that , during training , a yellow square object is referred to as a target object , but a red square object is not . However , a yellow square object is not directly referred to by calling it \u201c yellow square \u201d , but it is referred to in other ways , such as \u201c small square \u201d . Q10 : Does `` relatively '' test new attributes that were never seen or referred to during training ? Or just new ways of referring to these attributes ? A10 : It does not test new attributes , and it is just new ways of referring . Q11 : What 's an example of `` class inference '' ? A11 : It requires compositional generalization for the combination of action type and object size ( large object needs to pull / push twice to move ) . In training , the combination of \u2018 push \u2019 and \u2018 square of size 3 ( large ) \u2019 is held out , and they are evaluated in the test . For example , Training : \u201c pull a red square \u201d ( the red square is of size 3 ) . \u201c push a red square \u201d ( the red square is of size 2 ) Test : \u201c push a red square \u201d ( the red square is of size 3 ) . Q12 : How is attention evaluated ? Automatically ? A12 : Attention is evaluated by checking whether the attention map has the highest value on the position of the ground truth target object . The ground truth target object is not used as an input for either training or inference , but it is only used for evaluating attention . Q13 : I am confused about why the term `` entropy '' is used here , because I do n't see the relationship between the function EntReg and entropy ( i.e. , H ( x ) where x is a distribution ) . A13 : Here , the relation is not explicit . We actually do not need to know H ( x ) , as long as the regularization reduces it ( without knowing the amount ) . Please also refer to A5 above . Q14 : EntReg here just seems to add some noise to an input x , which is not necessarily a distribution . A14 : Here , a distribution ( and its entropy ) is defined on a dataset , not on each sample . Please refer to A5 above . Q15 : Several terms used in the model description are vague and should be defined : what is a `` node '' x_i ( Section 4.1 ) ? What is the difference between ERL and EntReg ( my reading is that ERL is an MLP with EntReg between the layers ) ? What is a `` keyword '' ( as opposed to just a `` word '' ) ? A15 : x_i is a scalar element ( node ) in input representation , and y_i is an scalar element for output representation . In ERL , each scalar element is treated separately . A scalar element reduces the number of its possible values by non-linearly expanding to high dimensional space and applying entropy regularization , then mapping back to a scalar . This is designed for the case that different scalar elements correspond to different components , so that we do not want to mix them , but hope to reduce their entropy . Keywords are just words , and keywords emphasize that they are extracted by the command module . Also thank you for other suggestions . We hope to improve the paper with them ."}], "0": {"review_id": "b6BdrqTnFs7-0", "review_text": "Summary This paper tries to address a very important problem , compositional generalization in grounded agent instruction learning .

The paper proposes to use `` entropy regularization '' as a way to enforce that spurious correlations between input tokens and output actions are not learned . The proposed model shows promising results on the gSCAN benchmark , achieving nearly 100 % accuracy on all but one task . # # # # # # # # Reasons for score : While the paper achieves impressive performance on the synthetic gSCAN dataset , the paper 's framing of the problem , discussion of related work , and description of the model are vague and confusing . As a reviewer , I am left with many questions and confusions about the setup and scope of this paper , and my review depends on clarifications from the authors during the discussion period . # # # # # # # # Strengths : 1 . The paper achieves impressive performance on the gSCAN dataset across all but one task , and describes intuitions on why the remaining task failed . 1.The paper also achieves impressive results on the target length task when compared to existing systems . 1.The proposed model is relatively simple . # # # # # # # # Weaknesses : 1 . My main concern about the paper is its framing of the problem and use of vague terms , especially in the introduction and abstract . See below for more suggestions as well . The paper should be more clear about the scope of compositional generalization it is targeting , especially early in the paper . Specifically , it seems to be targeting novel compositions of attributes and objects in an input instruction . However , there are other dimensions of compositional generalization which the paper does not cover . For example , generalization to new compositions of the environment itself ( i.e. , novel combinations of the objects , attributes , and spatial relations , as evaluated in datasets like ALFRED ( Shridhar et la.2020 ) , Room to Room ( Anderson et al.2018 ) ) , or novel deep compositional structures in the output space ( as in semantic parsing , e.g. , Finegan-Dollak et al.2018 , in comparison to shallow output space compositions such as new manner/direction combinations ) . This paper should clarify the dimensions along which it is evaluating compositional generalization , and contrast that with other forms of compositional generalization . Some other related work which evaluates compositional generalization and are missed include VQA with Changing Priors ( Agrawal et al.2017 ) and CLEVR CoGenT ( Johnson et al.2017 ) .Especially for CLEVR CoGenT , there are several systems which achieve near perfect accuracy on that compositional generalization task , such as NS-VQA ( Yi et al.2019 ) , which are not compared against . 1.The evaluation is only performed on a single synthetic dataset . While it performs well on this benchmark , evaluation on other grounded instruction following tasks , such as some of the examples above , or even on non-instruction tasks such as image question answering , would make the results more convincing . # # # # # # # # Major questions for the authors about the paper setup : 1 . I am confused about where `` entropy regularization '' comes into play in the model . As it is written it seems to be used in two places : ( 1 ) in the actual forward-pass , the only difference is that it adds noise to an input ( and the noise is zero at evaluation time ) , and ( 2 ) during optimization , it also minimizes the L2 norm of these layers ' activations . Is this correct ? 1.In the ablation setting , it 's unclear to me what exactly is being ablated . If EntReg appears both in optimization as L2 regularization and in the forward pass as noise , then are these ablated independently ? What is ERL replaced with when ablated ? And what exactly is NodeOut -- it 's not defined anywhere earlier in the paper , if it is the most critical component of the approach ( as indicated by Table 2 ) , this is concerning . Other clarification questions for the authors : 1 . What is the intuition of the EntReg component actually solving the problem of learning spurious correlations ? How does it actually limit the correlations ( if this is the intent ) between components if it is not considering some relationship between two components ? 1.What does it mean for compositional generalization to require prior knowledge on distribution change ? 1.Am I correct in understanding that the command module will always result in the same output while the agent is acting in the environment ? Nothing about the command module seems to change as it is not conditioned on an environment observation . 1.How does the model know the types and values of the words in the command ? 1.How do `` yellow squares '' and `` red squares '' actually differ in the compositionality they require ? 1.Does `` relatively '' test new attributes that were never seen or referred to during training ? Or just new ways of referring to these attributes ? 1.What 's an example of `` class inference '' ? 1.How is attention evaluated ? Automatically ? # # # # # # # # Suggestions to clarify the presentation of the paper and the approach : 1 . The related work should contrast the proposed approach or evaluation setup with the cited works . E.g. , how does the proposed approach differ from the approaches used on SCAN ? 1 . `` entropy regularization '' is a more general term than it is used in this paper , so I would suggest renaming it . E.g. , it is often used to prevent entropy collapse in reinforcement learning by adding an additional term in the optimization that optimizes for higher entropy output distributions . 1.I am confused about why the term `` entropy '' is used here , because I do n't see the relationship between the function EntReg and entropy ( i.e. , H ( x ) where x is a distribution ) . EntReg here just seems to add some noise to an input x , which is not necessarily a distribution . 1.Several terms are vague/undefined . The term `` component '' is vague without a formal definition of the task being studied . Later on , I am also confused on what `` a change of direction between steps '' means , and why there is a direction , action , and manner . The example in Figure 1 does n't show the output sequences or examples of different manners , and I only have an idea of what `` manner '' means when I read the gSCAN paper or later on in this paper that manner might include spinning , being slow/fast , etc . So , I would suggest , e.g. , showing the actual possible space of outputs . 1.The proposed approach should be described more concretely in the introduction before the results of it are described . 1.Several terms used in the model description are vague and should be defined : what is a `` node '' x_i ( Section 4.1 ) ? What is the difference between ERL and EntReg ( my reading is that ERL is an MLP with EntReg between the layers ) ? What is a `` keyword '' ( as opposed to just a `` word '' ) ? Suggestions on the description of model / results : 1 . The model seems to be described formally three times : in Algorithm 1 , Figure 2 , and Section 4.2 . Its description could be more concise ( e.g. , by removing Algorithm 1 ) . 1.The experiments section should contrast the proposed approach with the baselines/other systems in a meaningful way . 1.I know this is coming from the gSCAN dataset , but the names of the 8 tasks are very confusing . If it 's possible to augment these with a short keyword description that accurately describes the forms of generalization they are evaluating , this would make things a lot easier to read . Particularly , upon reading the results table , the `` yellow squares '' and `` red squares '' settings are n't meaningfully different , and I have no idea what they are testing differently . 1.If Figure 3 is just a bar graph version of Table 1 , it could probably be removed as it is does n't add any information over Table 1 . It 's missing the numbers in the bars , the x-axis is hard to read , and it 's unclear to me whether this is graphing the mean , max , etc . 1.The meaning of $ k $ should be defined before Figure 3 and Table 1 are presented .", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Q6 : What does it mean for compositional generalization to require prior knowledge on distribution change ? A6 : Compositional generalization has multiple components , and the generalization requires recombining values of different components in a novel way . So it requires knowing what are the types of components , such as shape and color , to recombine and generalize . This is what we mean by requiring prior knowledge on distribution change for compositional generalization . It is complicated to discuss whether machines can learn the component types without component specific prior knowledge , and it is beyond the scope of this paper . However , to our best knowledge , many current algorithms have some way to use the prior knowledge . In some cases , the prior knowledge is in the design of data structure ( position and color in image ) . Some approaches design training data distribution to make the components statistically marginally independent . Others design model architectures , regularizations and learning algorithms with the prior knowledge . So here , we discuss different ways to use the prior knowledge to explain the difference between the approaches . Q7 : Am I correct in understanding that the command module will always result in the same output while the agent is acting in the environment ? Nothing about the command module seems to change as it is not conditioned on an environment observation . A7 : Yes.Command module depends only on the command , which does not change while the agent is acting . Q8 : How does the model know the types and values of the words in the command ? A8 : It \u2019 s learnt automatically . We use the prior knowledge that there should be frameworks of types and values ( in design of attention ) , but we do not have sample-wise annotations for them . Q9 : How do `` yellow squares '' and `` red squares '' actually differ in the compositionality they require ? A9 : The required compositionality is the same . The difference is that , during training , a yellow square object is referred to as a target object , but a red square object is not . However , a yellow square object is not directly referred to by calling it \u201c yellow square \u201d , but it is referred to in other ways , such as \u201c small square \u201d . Q10 : Does `` relatively '' test new attributes that were never seen or referred to during training ? Or just new ways of referring to these attributes ? A10 : It does not test new attributes , and it is just new ways of referring . Q11 : What 's an example of `` class inference '' ? A11 : It requires compositional generalization for the combination of action type and object size ( large object needs to pull / push twice to move ) . In training , the combination of \u2018 push \u2019 and \u2018 square of size 3 ( large ) \u2019 is held out , and they are evaluated in the test . For example , Training : \u201c pull a red square \u201d ( the red square is of size 3 ) . \u201c push a red square \u201d ( the red square is of size 2 ) Test : \u201c push a red square \u201d ( the red square is of size 3 ) . Q12 : How is attention evaluated ? Automatically ? A12 : Attention is evaluated by checking whether the attention map has the highest value on the position of the ground truth target object . The ground truth target object is not used as an input for either training or inference , but it is only used for evaluating attention . Q13 : I am confused about why the term `` entropy '' is used here , because I do n't see the relationship between the function EntReg and entropy ( i.e. , H ( x ) where x is a distribution ) . A13 : Here , the relation is not explicit . We actually do not need to know H ( x ) , as long as the regularization reduces it ( without knowing the amount ) . Please also refer to A5 above . Q14 : EntReg here just seems to add some noise to an input x , which is not necessarily a distribution . A14 : Here , a distribution ( and its entropy ) is defined on a dataset , not on each sample . Please refer to A5 above . Q15 : Several terms used in the model description are vague and should be defined : what is a `` node '' x_i ( Section 4.1 ) ? What is the difference between ERL and EntReg ( my reading is that ERL is an MLP with EntReg between the layers ) ? What is a `` keyword '' ( as opposed to just a `` word '' ) ? A15 : x_i is a scalar element ( node ) in input representation , and y_i is an scalar element for output representation . In ERL , each scalar element is treated separately . A scalar element reduces the number of its possible values by non-linearly expanding to high dimensional space and applying entropy regularization , then mapping back to a scalar . This is designed for the case that different scalar elements correspond to different components , so that we do not want to mix them , but hope to reduce their entropy . Keywords are just words , and keywords emphasize that they are extracted by the command module . Also thank you for other suggestions . We hope to improve the paper with them ."}}
