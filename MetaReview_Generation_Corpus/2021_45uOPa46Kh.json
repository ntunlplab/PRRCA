I do n't see analysis on how well the instructions are predicted . In solving VLN tasks , it is only necessary to use p ( X | a_t , h_t ) to score the given instruction ( not the prediction or language generation ) and select the accurate action a_t in each time-step .

In Figure 2 , we present the accuracy comparisons between the generative and discriminative policies . The x-axis in Figure 2 corresponds to the number of time steps from the beginning of the transition ( t=0 ) to the end , which we will clarify in the revision . We do not observe any significant difference in the accuracy even when t is small between the generative and discriminative policies . One interesting observation in this aspect was the large fluctuation in 1-TENT when t was small . This is illustrated in Fig.3.We do not have any rigorous explanation behind this phenomenon , but believe it is worth future investigation . > Table 1 shows the performance of both Gen. + Disc . and Gen. + Disc . + backtracking .

The results of Gen.+Disc . on test ( unseen ) without backtracking is PL : 11.90 , NE : 5.52 , SR : 0.51 , SPL : 0.46 . Backtracking improves the success rate but SPL is not so altered . We consider this is due to the longer trajectories . We will include this in the revision if needed . > Meanwhile , in test ( unseen ) , with backtracking , Gen. + Disc . achieves the same success rate compared with FAST ( which also do backtracking ) , so the performance gain seems small . Our proposed model ( Gen. + Disc.with backtracking ) performs as best as FAST in the success rate and clearly out-performs FAST in SPL of the recommended R2R metric . We did further analyses on this . In FAST ( the FAST-short model in their paper ) , the backtracking is triggered when the agent tries to revisit some places it has visited . We checked that 49.9 % of trajectories of the follower model ( by Fried et al.2018 ) include revisiting , while 16.8 % of the trajectories in our Gen.+Disc.-Policy without backtracking include revisiting in the unseen-validation .

Thank you for your suggestion . The suggested paper addresses the valuable insights for the action prior . There are two aspects to considering this . First , if we assume that the environment distribution is stationary across training and test sets , it will indeed be helpful to use the action prior estimated from the training environments . Second , your suggestion is quite interesting in that if we had access to target environments in the test time or had some indications about target environment distributions , we can estimate the action prior before deploying a trained policy by replacing it with the uninformative action prior we used . In both cases , our generative formulation naturally enables us to easily swap the action prior accordingly . > The ( A ) and ( B ) notation in Table 1 was super confusing and it took me a while to figure out it was just an alias for Disc + Aug versus Gen + Aug since that is n't written explicitly anywhere . Yes , this is true ( we are thankful for your careful reading ) .

At each timestep , for each action , the generation of the instruction is scored . This modeling achieves the-state-of-the-art or competitive results on standard benchmarks Room-to-room ( R2R ) and Room-for-room ( R4R ) . The proposed generative modeling also allows us to interpret how the model process the instruction . To do so , token-wise prediction entropy ( 1-TENT ) is introduced . The core idea is that if a token is critical for the trajectory , the entropy of scoring the token for all actions will below .

Without knowing what kind of environments a trained policy was put to , which was what we assumed in this paper , we believe it is natural to use the most uninformative prior on the action distribution ( p ( a|s ) ) . It is however plausible that there are scenarios in which we can take a glimpse at future environments to better estimate this action prior distribution which can then be readily plugged in to our generative policy .

In solving VLN tasks , it is only necessary to use p ( X | a_t , h_t ) to score the given instruction ( not the prediction or language generation ) and select the accurate action a_t in each time-step . In other words , it is the relative magnitude of p ( X|a , h_t ) across possible actions a , rather than the absolute ability of generating X given any correct action a \u2019 . In Figure 2 , we present the accuracy comparisons between the generative and discriminative policies . The x-axis in Figure 2 corresponds to the number of time steps from the beginning of the transition ( t=0 ) to the end , which we will clarify in the revision . We do not observe any significant difference in the accuracy even when t is small between the generative and discriminative policies . One interesting observation in this aspect was the large fluctuation in 1-TENT when t was small . This is illustrated in Fig.3.We do not have any rigorous explanation behind this phenomenon , but believe it is worth future investigation . > Table 1 shows the performance of both Gen. + Disc . and Gen. + Disc . + backtracking . However , In Table 2 , the performance of Gen. + Disc . on test ( unseen ) is not shown . This is less satisfying . The results of Gen.+Disc . on test ( unseen ) without backtracking is PL : 11.90 , NE : 5.52 , SR : 0.51 , SPL : 0.46 . Backtracking improves the success rate but SPL is not so altered . We consider this is due to the longer trajectories . We will include this in the revision if needed . > Meanwhile , in test ( unseen ) , with backtracking , Gen. + Disc . achieves the same success rate compared with FAST ( which also do backtracking ) , so the performance gain seems small . Our proposed model ( Gen. + Disc.with backtracking ) performs as best as FAST in the success rate and clearly out-performs FAST in SPL of the recommended R2R metric . We did further analyses on this . In FAST ( the FAST-short model in their paper ) , the backtracking is triggered when the agent tries to revisit some places it has visited . We checked that 49.9 % of trajectories of the follower model ( by Fried et al.2018 ) include revisiting , while 16.8 % of the trajectories in our Gen.+Disc.-Policy without backtracking include revisiting in the unseen-validation . This implies that the proposed approach avoids redundant trajectories . > The paper misses implementation details . For example , how p ( X|a_t , h_t ) is modeled is not shown . The authors say `` We use the network architecture of the speaker from ( Fried et al. , 2018 ) to implement generative policies which include a language model p ( X|at , ht ) . '' But the paper is not self-contained . It is better to at least describe the model in appendix . Thanks for your suggestion . We will detail the network architecture and associated hyperparameters in the appendix . > The paper say `` We finetune each policy using imitation learning '' . However , imitation learning is a very board term , not necessarily mean the student-forcing implied by the paper . It is better to use a more concrete terms . This is a great point . We will clarify it by explicitly mentioning that we used student-forcing ."}, "2": {"review_id": "45uOPa46Kh-2", "review_text": "This paper presents a generative speaker model that selects actions at each timestep that facilitate the generation of the instruction , and demonstrates that a combination of discriminative and generative action prediction models outperform either alone , with the generative model primarily facilitating better generalization to unseen environments . It would help to have more details in the paper rather than relegated to the appendix , maybe at the expense of the long TENT analysis ? I did n't get too much out of that , but would have liked to see more details of the main algorithm in the paper ( e.g. , details of how the discriminative/generative combo was done ) . Improvements : - Assumption that p ( a_t|h_t ) is uniform is reasonable , but might be improved by using priors from the training data since there are strong action-conditioned biases in VLN R2R [ https : //arxiv.org/abs/1811.00613 Figure 2 ] ; some geometric form of this likely holds for the panoramic setting as well ( especially for what were formerly `` forward '' actions - > continuing along headings close to previous heading ) . - The ( A ) and ( B ) notation in Table 1 was super confusing and it took me a while to figure out it was just an alias for Disc + Aug versus Gen + Aug since that is n't written explicitly anywhere . - That the combination of discriminative and generative policies gives best results is a major point in the paper , but the combined policy description is relegated to the appendix which feels weird .

Thank you for your suggestion . The suggested paper addresses the valuable insights for the action prior . There are two aspects to considering this . First , if we assume that the environment distribution is stationary across training and test sets , it will indeed be helpful to use the action prior estimated from the training environments . Second , your suggestion is quite interesting in that if we had access to target environments in the test time or had some indications about target environment distributions , we can estimate the action prior before deploying a trained policy by replacing it with the uninformative action prior we used . In both cases , our generative formulation naturally enables us to easily swap the action prior accordingly . > The ( A ) and ( B ) notation in Table 1 was super confusing and it took me a while to figure out it was just an alias for Disc + Aug versus Gen + Aug since that is n't written explicitly anywhere . Yes , this is true ( we are thankful for your careful reading ) . We found it difficult to include the detailed instructions of notation ( A ) and ( B ) in the current manuscript due to the space limit . In the final revision , we will explicitly specify the relations and aliases of these models . > That the combination of discriminative and generative policies gives best results is a major point in the paper , but the combined policy description is relegated to the appendix which feels weird . Thank you for this comment .

Thank you for this suggestion . We penalized a_t as well . Therefore , as you mentioned , the training for the a_t is canceled in Eq.3 while all other actions are penalized ."}, "3": {"review_id": "45uOPa46Kh-3", "review_text": "This paper introduces the generative modeling of the task of vision and language navigation . At each timestep , for each action , the generation of the instruction is scored . This modeling achieves the-state-of-the-art or competitive results on standard benchmarks Room-to-room ( R2R ) and Room-for-room ( R4R ) . The proposed generative modeling also allows us to interpret how the model process the instruction . To do so , token-wise prediction entropy ( 1-TENT ) is introduced . The core idea is that if a token is critical for the trajectory , the entropy of scoring the token for all actions will below . Thus by visualizing the 1-TENT for each timestep we can analyze how and when a model fails or what kind of capabilities are missing in the model .

Please try to simplify or add a figure or give examples S2 Introduction penultimate paragraph : Please clarify the concept of 'richer learning signal ' . This paragraph is rather more cryptical compared to the rest of the paper . S3 Figure2 : please add a sentence or two to clarify how this is generated and the punchline of the caption .

Please move one of them to the appendix -- which will give more space to panorama images . Also , the figure is already hard to interpret without the guidance for the level of 1-TENT scores for tokens . Q1 : Section1 : The assumption that the action probabilities are uniform given the state makes sense . However , in reality , it 's not true . Have you done any experiments on this or any ideas on how to address that ? Q2 : Section 4 : This might be a lot to ask but is it possible to have results on TouchDown or any other outdoor navigation datasets ? Problems are structurally the same however the way people give instructions in outdoor scenes will be different . It would be great to see the generalization of the generative approach to outdoor scenes .", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "reply_text": "Thank you so much for your comments and considerations ! > S1 Introduction 4th paragraph : It was rather hard to understand what 's the difference between Fried et . al.and this work . Please try to simplify or add a figure or give examples Thanks for your suggestion . We will think of a way to make it more concise and to-the-point in making the distinction between Fried et al . 's and our approaches . In short , our approach applies Bayes ' rule at each step in order to design a generative policy ( analogous to Fried et al . 's speaker model ) that does not require us to have a full trajectory . > S2 Introduction penultimate paragraph : Please clarify the concept of 'richer learning signal ' . This paragraph is rather more cryptical compared to the rest of the paper . We agree 'richer learning signal ' is a vague concept . We will try to clarify it further . In short , we used 'richer learning signal ' to refer to the fact that there are more to be predicted when training a generative policy , as it needs to predict the entire instruction at each time step rather than just the action selected from the shortest path . > S3 Figure2 : please add a sentence or two to clarify how this is generated and the punchline of the caption . Also , add the legend for x axis . We will do so . The x-axis is the number of time steps from the beginning of the trajectory ( t=0 ) to the end . > S4 Section 5.3 : I believe you are referring to Figure 2 not Figure 5 which is in the appendix . We sincerely appreciate your careful reading . Section 5.3 mentions Figure 2 .

Have you done any experiments on this or any ideas on how to address that ? Thanks for the suggestion . We agree with you that this is an interesting avenue to pursue . Without knowing what kind of environments a trained policy was put to , which was what we assumed in this paper , we believe it is natural to use the most uninformative prior on the action distribution ( p ( a|s ) ) . It is however plausible that there are scenarios in which we can take a glimpse at future environments to better estimate this action prior distribution which can then be readily plugged in to our generative policy . We believe this approach and extensions should be studied further in the future . > Q2 : Section 4 : This might be a lot to ask but is it possible to have results on TouchDown or any other outdoor navigation datasets ? Problems are structurally the same however the way people give instructions in outdoor scenes will be different . It would be great to see the generalization of the generative approach to outdoor scenes . We focused on two in-door tasks ( R2R and R4R ) while developing and thoroughly investigating this generative policy . Because we have now confirmed the efficacy of the proposed approach , we agree with you that it is the right time to continue on to applying this approach to a more diverse set of scenarios , including outdoor navigation tasks . We hope to pursue this direction in the future ."}}
