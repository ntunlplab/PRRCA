In doing so, it produces abstract disentangled representations of the scene which could be used by agents, models, and other ML methods to reason about the scene.\n\nThis is yet another paper where the reviewers disappointingly did not interact. The first round of reviews were mediocre-to-acceptable. The authors, I think, did a good job of responding to the concerns raised by the reviewers and edited their paper accordingly. Unfortunately, not one of the reviewers took the time to consider author responses.\n\nIn light of my reading of the responses and the revisions in the paper, I am leaning towards treating this as a paper where the review process has failed the authors, and recommending acceptance. The paper presents a novel method and dataset, and the experiments are reasonably convincing. The paper has flaws and the authors are advised to carefully take into account the concerns flagged by reviewers\u2014many of which they have responded to\u2014in producing their final manuscript.", "reviews": [{"review_id": "SyNPk2R9K7-0", "review_text": "[Overview] In this paper, the authors proposed a new format of representation called scene programs, to describe the visual scenes. To extract the scene programs from scenes, the authors exploited the off-the-shelf object detection and segmentations model, mask r-cnn to extract all objects and the corresponding attributes from the images, and then detect groups for those objects, which are then used to generate the programs which matches the input scenes. The experiments are performed on a synthetics datasets which consists of multiple shapes with different attributes. The experiments shows that the proposed model can infer more accurate programs from the scenes, and those generated programs can be used to recover the input scenes more accurately. Besides, the authors also showed that the generated scene programs can be used for image editing and making visual analogy. [Strengthes] 1. The authors proposed a new representation, called scene programs, to describe the visual scenes with some textual program. This is a new scene representation, which could be potentially used in various scenarios, such as the image synthesis in graphics. 2. The authors proposed a hierarchical method to model the structures in scenes. Specifically, the objects in a scene are first extracted and then grouped into multiple clusters, which will be used to guide the scene program synthesis. 3. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method both qualitatively and quantitatively. The authors also showed the the programs generated can be sued for image editing and cross-modality matching. [Weaknesses] 1. It is a bit unfair to compare the proposed method with the two baseline methods listed in Table 2. The authors used a pre-trained mask-rcnn to detect all objects and predict the attributes for all objects. However, the counterpart methods have no access to this supervision. Even in this case, CNN-LSTM seems achieve comparable performance on the first three metrics. 2. The advantage of scene program compared with scene graph (Johnson et al) are not clear to me. Scene graph is also a symbolic representation for images. Also, for all the tasks mentioned in this paper, such as image editing and visual analogy, scene graph can probably also complete well. The authors should comment about the specific advantages of scene program in comparison with scene graph. 3. All the images shown in the paper seems arranged uniformly, which I think contains some bias to the proposed grouping strategy. I would like to see more diverse configurations of the foreground objects. It would be good to see if the proposed model can describe more complicated scenes. [Summary] This paper proposed a novel scene representations, called scene program. To extract the scene program, the authors proposed a hieratchical inference method. The resulting scene programs based on the proposed model outperforms several baseline models quantitatively.

We \u2019 d like to clarify that 1 ) The derender-LSTM baseline requires the same supervision as ours . 2 ) We acknowledge the fact that our method requires more supervision than the CNN-LSTM baseline method , and will revise the paper to clearly state that . Note the situation is different when we consider generalization to data where program supervision is hard to obtain ( e.g.real images ) . Because our program synthesizer works on abstract object attribute space , it does not require any fine-tuning to work on real images , where the end-to-end CNN-LSTM approach would require ( image , program ) pairs . Disentangling vision recognition and program synthesis is a key to our model \u2019 s success on real images ( Fig.7 ) .Our method achieves higher test accuracy and better generalization performance than both baseline , and more importantly , it generalizes better to real images . As synthetic data can be easily obtained , we believe that the comparison in Table 2 is fairly established . These results and the experiments on real images demonstrate the significant advantage of our method . 2.Scene graphs We thank the reviewer for bringing up scene graphs , which is another important high-level representation of scenes . Here we would like to emphasize that the roles of scene graphs and the proposed scene programs are complementary : scene graphs focus on the pairwise relationships , e.g.an object can be on , in , or under another object ; in contrast , scene programs focus on the higher-order , program-like regularity among multiple objects ( e.g. , repetition ) . Compared with scene graphs , scene programs ( i ) explicitly capture these regularities , modeling correlations among multiple objects ; and ( ii ) are more efficient in terms of description length . For tasks such as editing structured images , scene programs are a more suitable representation , because editing can be performed on the program space for higher efficiency , as displayed in Fig.6.With scene graphs , we would have to edit each object one by one . 3.Scene complexity In our main experiment , we place objects on a grid and then jitter their positions and orientations . Results on these data suggest that scene programs describe these structured images well . We agree with reviewers on the importance of handling more complex data . In the revision by Nov. 26 , we will add results on scenes where objects are placed at random .

Given an input image and an initial set of detections obtained from bottom-up detectors a sequence to sequence network is used to generate programs in a domain specific language (DSL). The authors consider a dataset where simple primitives are arranged in layouts in 3D scenes with varying material and color properties. They argue that the scene representation lead to better generalization on novel scene types and improve over baselines on image analogy tasks. The paper is well written but the evaluation and technical novelty is weak. First, the use of scene programs is not a contribution of this paper. Going beyond the works cited in the related work section, several recent works have proposed and investigated the advantages of program synthesis for shape generation (e.g., CSGNet Sharma et al. CVPR 2018 and Scene derendering, Wu et al., CVPR 2017), visual reasoning (Modular networks, Andreas et al., 2015), among others. At a high-level the motivation of the program level representation for the considered tasks is not highlighted. It seems that an attribute-based representation, i.e., the output of the mask R-CNN detector that describes the image as a collection of objects, material properties, and their positions and scales is a sufficient representation. The higher-order relationships can be relatively easily extracted from the detections since the images are clean and clutter free. A baseline approach where the program synthesis was performed using search and grouping should be compared with. The considered tasks are relatively simple achieving 99.5% token-level accuracy. The evaluation beyond the synthetic datasets is fairly limited and it is unclear how well the method generalizes to novel images in clutter and occlusion. In summary, the paper makes a number of observations that have been motivated in a number of prior works, but the contributions of this paper is not highlighted (e.g., over neural scene derendering). The main claim that higher-order relationships are being modeled is not apparent due to the simplicity of the scenes being considered. For example, the program blocks being considered are somewhat arbitrary and a comparison with a clustering based grouping approach should have been evaluated. The experimental evaluation is weak in several aspects. The generalization to real images is anecdotal with only two examples shown in the Figure 7.

Our paper is new and different from all these papers . Most importantly , our scene programs focus on modeling the high-level structural relationships among multiple objects , building upon and extending CSGNet and De-rendering , which only explored sequential , primitive-level programs . Only with our scene programs and the loop structure , may we efficiently describe patterns that involve higher-order , program-like regularity among multiple objects ( e.g. , repetition ) and edit images with minimal interactions ( Fig.6,7 ) .2.High-level motivations As mentioned above , many tasks become possible only with our program representations , not an attribute-based representation . For example , for the image in Fig.6 ( a ) , it is natural for one to imagine how could we add another row of cylinders on the right side , or change cylinders to cubes . Scene programs allow us to perform such tasks in an efficient and intuitive way . However , if we represent the scene by its objects and attributes , we would have to individually edit each object , losing the benefit from their high-level correlations . We agree that it \u2019 s important to discuss the alternative approach , where the program synthesis is performed using search and grouping . There are two possible approaches for a structured search over the space of programs , both of which would be too slow for our task : - Constraint solving : we would have to use an SMT solver . Ellis et al [ 1 ] used SMT solvers to infer 2D graphics programs , and takes on the order of minutes per program . As 3D scenes ( with attributes ) have a much larger search space , such an approach would not be able to find a solution in reasonable time . - Stochastic search : Here the problem would be at least as tough as doing inverse graphics , so we can safely assume that this would work no better than MCMC for inverse graphics . In Picture ( Kulkarni et al . [ 2 ] ) , their approach takes minutes for a 2D image with simple contours . We have contacted the authors of these two papers , who confirmed our estimates of the efficiency of their methods . In comparison , on average our neural program synthesis model takes less than 0.4 second to generate scene programs for an image .

In the revision by Nov. 26 , we will add results on scenes where objects are placed at random . Following your suggestion , we have also experimented with a simple heuristic grouping algorithm : we start with a random object which forms a group . As long as there are objects of distance less than a threshold from this group , we add them into the group .

The experiments on real image show our model \u2019 s ability to generalize to new data distributions . 4 ) Top proposals : Note that the group detector also outputs the classification result of the group category . Here \u201c top \u201d refers to the softmax score . We don \u2019 t have any information of the ground truth program at test time . 5 ) Program representations : We will give detailed definitions in the Appendix . In short , a program is represented as a matrix , where each row contains a program command , which is a program token followed by its parameters . Thanks ! Please don \u2019 t hesitate to let us know for any additional comments on the paper or on the planned changes ."}}
