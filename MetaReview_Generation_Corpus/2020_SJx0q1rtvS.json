This paper leverages the stability of differential privacy for the problems of anomaly and backdoor attack detection. The reviewers agree that this application of differential privacy is novel. The theory of the paper appears to be a bit weak (with very strong assumptions on the private learner), although it reflects the basic underlying idea of the detection technique. The paper also provides some empirical evaluation of the technique.", "reviews": [{"review_id": "SJx0q1rtvS-0", "review_text": "This paper leverages differential privacy\u2019s stability properties to investigate its use for improved anomaly and backdoor attack detection. Under an assumption (called \u201cuniformly asymptotic empirical risk minimization\u201d), the authors show that difference between the expected loss of a differentially private learning algorithm on an outlier (where the expectation is taken over the randomness of the learning algorithm) and the expected loss of the same algorithm on data from the underlying distribution (expectation taken over data & randomness of the algorithm) is lower bounded by a (possibly/hopefully) non-negative quantity with high probability. The authors then conduct a set of experiments to show that differential privacy improves the performance of outliers, novel examples, and backdoor attack detection. Overall, the paper is very well written and easy to read. The paper also tackles an important and timely problem that is relevant to the ICLR community. While there has been some recent work on connecting differential privacy to robustness & attacks, this paper investigates the use of differential private model training as a means to improve novelty detection at inference time. A few points that need attention from the authors: 1. The theory developed is insightful in general but has very little (to no) practical value. For starters, it assumes that differentially private model training is uniformly asymptotic to empirical risk minimization. This is not necessarily true for highly non-convex models trained with SGD. Further, it cannot be verify via experimentations (despite the authors\u2019 attempt to sanity check it using Figure 1). More importantly, the theory developed in Section 3 is not used in any meaningful way in the experiments section \u2014 the anomaly detection schemes are agnostic to it. 2. The authors make no attempt to co-optimize the performance of the model with its ability to be used for better anomaly detection. For instance, the authors choose an l2-clipping-norm C of 1 and do not consider trading off C with the noise variance. When the training set contains anomalies, this work can be viewed as \u201cwhat is the impact of differential privacy\u201d on a training sets with a majority group (training examples from a given distribution) and a minority group (training examples from a different distribution). Under this view, this paper essentially says that \u201cdifferential privacy leads to disparate impact on model accuracy/loss\u201d. This has been recently investigated in the following NeurIPS19 paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12101. Thus the contributions of the paper are not substantial.

A : We agree with the reviewer that the rigorous verification of the UAERM assumption for deep neural network can not be done empirically , as it involves evaluating the expectation of loss taken over the randomness of differentially private algorithms as well as randomness of data distribution . The role of Figure 4 is indeed a sanity check of the assumption by replacing the expectation with the average of random samples . The results in Figure 4 demonstrate the plausibility of the assumption . We have added the explanation as well as the detailed experiment setup in Section 4.1 `` Validation of UAERM for Noisy SGD '' . Moreover , we would like to emphasize that our theory is * useful * as it can be used to explain various findings in the experiments . For example , as shown in Table 1 , the more outliers in the training dataset , the higher noise scale it requires to achieve the best anomaly detection performance . This scenario can be explained by Theorem 2 . As the second paragraph on page 4 explains , our theory shows that the privacy parameters can not be too large or too small to ensure optimal anomaly detection performance , which coincides with the experimental results in Table 1 . We have revised the paper to clarify the correlation between the implications of our theory and experimental findings , which could be found in the last paragraph of Section 4.1 . Finally , our theory is a generic result and it can be used to explain the performance to detect general out-of-distribution samples . Anomaly detection is one of the applications that our theory can apply to . We have also added a detailed explanation in the last paragraph of Section 3 .

A : Thank you for pointing out the direction of co-optimizing the performance of the model with its ability to be used for better anomaly detection . We apologize if our paper didn \u2019 t explain well . In fact , for all 3 models evaluated in the paper , including the autoencoders and DeepLog , their sole purpose is anomaly detection . Only for backdoor attack detection did we use the same CNN model for both image classification and backdoor detection . We have added the experiments of varying C with fixed noise variance for backdoor attack detection , which could be found in Table 3 . From Table 2 & 3 , we can observe that the best model for anomaly detection could have a similar set of parameters with the best model for image classification . However , in general , classification accuracy and robustness are two conflicting desiderata ; model trainers can tune the privacy parameter in order to meet the task-specific requirements for accuracy and robustness .

It first presents a theoretical analysis, which establishes a lower bound on the prediction performance difference between normal and outlier data. By adding noise into the training process, the outliers in the dataset will be hidden by the noise, which will result in a model that utilizes the normal data. In this way, when deploying the model, the model will find the outlier by observing low confidence. #Strength It is good to see that the paper builds a connection between the privacy parameter and the noise level and the experiments make the theory valid. #Weakness I\u2019m not an expert in differential privacy. But as far as I\u2019m concerned, a typical downside is that the false positive rate will increase and there is no theoretical guarantee that the increase of false-positive rate will be negligible compared with the increase of true positive rate.

Also , as indicated in the first paragraph of page 7 , reducing false negatives could be more important because false positives could be further checked by system admin , while false negatives may never be discovered until a disastrous event occurs . Secondly , the backdoor attack scenario mentioned by the reviewer is indeed a common one . Another common scenario for backdoor attacks is crowdsourcing , where the model trainer gathers training data from untrusted individuals .

Differential privacy was proposed as a privacy metric which limits the contribution of a single data point in the training set to the output. This property naturally controls how poisoned data would affect the output of the learned model. Under the assumption that a well-trained model would incur a higher loss on the outliers, the paper gives a theoretic bound on how this loss will decrease if there are poisoned samples in the training set. The paper also performs several experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. The paper shows that add differential privacy during training can improve the performance of autoencoder-based outlier detection on MNIST data. For real-world data, the paper improves the performance of anomaly detection on the HDFS dataset over the state-of-the-art algorithm. The paper also shows empirically how DP can help improve backdoor attack detection. The paper is overall nicely written with some nice results. The paper could be improved if the following confusions can be resolved. 1. Novelty detection is generally referred to as detecting samples in the test set that are not in the distribution of the training set.
