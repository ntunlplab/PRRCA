For VGG16-CIFAR100 , we tried all combinations of the following parameters for AdamW , learning rate in [ 0.003,0.001,0.0003,0.0001 ] , weight decay in [ 0.01,0.003 , 0.001,0.0003,0.0001,0.00003 ] , $ \\beta_1=0.9 $ , $ \\beta_2=0.999 $ . The lowest test error is achieves with learning rate=0.0003 and weight decay=0.001 , at 33.71 +- .23 . For Padam , we try learning rate in [ 0.1,0.03,0.01,0.003,0.001,0.0003 ] , p in [ 1/4,1/8,1/16 ] , $ \\beta_1=0.9 $ , $ \\beta_2=0.999 $ . The lowest test error is attained with learning rate=0.03 and p=1/16 , at 34.38 +- .71 . Demon Adam , again , achieves significantly lower test error at 28.84 +- .18 .
