However, the experiments are limited to one domain and the paper needs proofreading. I will vote \"weak accept\" for this paper, as I think it is incremental and the experiments are too limited.

It is often stated that the ensemble model has better capacity than the single model. Some experimental proof of this better modelling capacity could help convince a reader that the ensemble is indeed beneficial and warranted (e.g., show that P_K is better than the single model P). Some evaluation or discussion on the computational costs of the method would be beneficial. I assume the ensemble-based method is more computationally intensive.

For a particular ensemble element, an intrinsic reward is defined as a log-term that measures the deviation in prediction between a Gaussian mixture over all ensemble elements and the particular ensemble element (at the previous update period). The intrinsic reward signal applied in practice is the minimum of the aforementioned quantity w.r.t. all ensemble elements. The authors provide some theoretical motivation for their approach and validate their method in sparse-reward continuous robotics domains (Mujoco), using PPO as reference algorithm. Experiments are averaged over 10 seeds and compared against various other intrinsic reward baselines including PPO without intrinsic motivation. In these experiments, the method provided by the authors seems to dominate over competing approaches. Quality I find the quality low. First, while I appreciate that the authors try to provide some theoretical motivation for their method, there is quite a gap from theory to practice. The theory assumes that the world model is known and considers a stationary reward signal. In practice, the world model is approximated with the current network ensemble, a quantity that is changing over time yielding a non-stationary signal. Second, the experiments are conducted in a sparse-reward modification of Mujoco-type environments that are non-sparse by construction. Sparsity is introduced by accumulating instantaneous rewards over some time window before \"releasing\" them. This way of sparsifying rewards yields weird partial observability issues, e.g. the same state-action pair observed at the right moment in time yields significant reward whereas at the wrong moment in time yields no reward at all. Additionally, it is always guaranteed that there will be a reward signal at a certain frequency. There are probably better environments for studying the approach, like Atari for example. I do understand that the authors cite Oh et al. 2018 who apply the same technique of sparsification, but Oh et al. also conduct additional experiments in ALE. Clarity The paper is clearly written and easy to follow. On a side note, it could be stated more clearly that the presented approach is not model-based because no forward prediction is required for constructing intrinsic rewards (merely probability values are queried for observed transitions). There is one question I have though regarding the experiments where different intrinsic reward approaches are compared against each other. The paper states that all approaches normalize intrinsic rewards according to Equation (17)---why do all of them then need a different weighting factor \\beta as stated in the second paragraph of Section 3.3? Furthermore, since \\beta is fine-tuned for each intrinsic reward approach and each environment, can the authors please elaborate in detail how exactly this is accomplished (to ensure correct interpretability of the results)? Originality The originality is low. As stated by the authors, the proposed method is an incremental extension of Achiam and Sastry 2017 who proposed a similar method for non-ensemble methods. Significance The significance is low as well. The method's improvement over other intrinsic reward approaches is minor (the environments chosen by the authors are also not ideal). I feel the significance is reduced further by the fact that there are other model-based approaches that use models of the proposed kind for increasing sample-efficiency and performance considerably in non-sparse environments (e.g. Kurutach et al.2018). Update After reading the other reviews and the rebuttal, the concerns I have raised remain. I still feel this paper shouldn't be accepted to ICLR. However, given the extensive experimental analysis conducted by the authors, I feel a score of 1 from my side was too harsh. I therefore increase to 3.", "rating": "3: Weak Reject", "reply_text": "We would like to thank you for your valuable comments .

The paper's results demonstrate that this approach out-performs other benchmark approaches across a set of continuous control tasks. I'm curious about the motivation for taking the min surprise across the ensemble. Eqs 8-11 seem to motivate that this will make a tighter gap between the expected cumulative returns of the optimal policy and the policy with additional intrinsic rewards. This implies that this will converge to the same policy in the end, but I'm not sure that it implies that this is a good exploration strategy, an intrinsic reward of 0 would provide an even tighter bound. When you used the max or average return, was the problem that there was still too much intrinsic reward for the agent to converge? Or that it wasn't exploring enough or in the right places? For the experiments, it would be very interesting to see the intrinsic rewards accumulated over time for each approach. That plot could be very enlightening as to what is going on. It would also be great to see the results on these tasks when they're not modified to be sparse reward. Is your method a big hindrance in that case? Or does it still help? Your intro claims that typical model-free RL is about the circumstance where the agent receives non-zero reward for every time step. This is not true, many model-free RL papers look at tasks that have sparse reward on some or many steps. I would agree that in many continuous control problems, shaping rewards are added to ease the exploration problem. For Figure 3, how does the model-ensemble TRPO (Kurutach et al) fit in? Is that algorithm represented by one of the curves?

Motivations for taking the min surprise across the ensemble are our Proposition 1 and 2 : the minimum selection gives tightest upper bound on the expected KL divergence between true P and the ensemble P_K within the class of linear combinations of the individual surprise values . The maximum and average method can not give this tightest upper bound . An intrinsic reward of 0 would provide the theoretically tightest bound in Proposition 1 ( c=0 ) , but our setting is that extrinsic reward is zero at the beginning of our training , so we can not train our policy in this sparse-reward setting if we do not give any intrinsic reward . The mean curves of accumulated intrinsic reward for our approach converge to 0 at the end . This observation is valid since as our ensemble models are trained , we get smaller expected KL divergence between true P and the ensemble P_K and its corresponding intrinsic reward . Whether a certain type of intrinsic reward is helpful for non-sparse reward environments depends on the intrinsic reward coefficient tuning as well as the type of certain intrinsic reward . Too big hyperparameter hindered the performance , and some fine-tuned hyperparameters can improve the performance in a non-sparse reward setting , as shown in the recent work ( Leibfried , Pascual-Diaz , and Grau-Moya , `` A unified Bellman optimality principle combining reward maximization and empowerment '' , 2019 ) .
