{"year": "2021", "forum": "3LujMJM9EMp", "title": "DEMI: Discriminative Estimator of Mutual Information ", "decision": "Reject", "meta_review": "In the paper, the authors propose a new method for estimating the mutual information based on a neural network classification that is fairly straight forward. The proposed method compares relatively well with known methods for estimating mutual information with a very large number of samples. The main issue of this classifier (a neural network) is that it requires that a classifier that discriminates between x, y pairs coming from p(x,y) and x, y pair coming from p(x)p(y) (this is done via reshuffling). The reviewers point out that the procedure is interesting, but it does not perform significantly better than the other proposed methods.\n\nAlso, I want to add that the proposed method is trained by using a given NN trained with 20 epochs and a mini-batch of 64. This is a significant issue because if we train the NN to reduce the validation error the posterior probability estimates are typically overconfident a significant work is being done to calibrate them. Why 20? How do we select this number if we cannot use a validation set? With less training example does 20 also work? This is very relevant because in the areas in which p(x,y)/p(x)p(y) is low for very high MI values getting these estimates correctly is critical. The classifier does not need to perform accurately in classification, but an estimation of the posterior probability and NNs will tend to be overconfident here and provide a biased estimate for these values. It will also provide an overestimate probability in the area that both p(x,y) and p(x)p(y) are high. \n\nFinally, the authors reference the paper by Nguyen, Wainwright, and Jordan, but they do not acknowledge how that paper actually estimates log(p(x,y)/p(x)p(y)) similarly. That paper is very general and theoretical, and this paper can only be understood as a particular implementation of their solution. I think the authors missed that point in their paper. Also, I think the authors should acknowledge the papers that have come before using nearest neighbor or histograms for entropy estimation.

The main idea is that , instead of learning ( generative ) distributions of joint and marginals , learning a single likelihood ratio that is discriminative and hence more tractable : a posterior $ p ( z | x , y ) $ trying to distinguish between the joint distribution $ p ( x , y ) $ and the product distribution $ p ( x ) p ( y ) $ .

We agree these two problems are closely related and have expanded the Introduction to comment on this . Indeed , the independence test can be thought of as a binary hypothesis test for MI > 0 vs. MI=0 . In this paper , we consider the associated task of estimating the MI value . * 2.Authors discussed the theoretical optimum of their estimator when the number of samples approching to infinity . In the simulations , it seems that the number of training samples is also very large ( e.g. , 160k ) . What will happen in case of moderate or small number of samples ? * > We thank the reviewer for this suggestion ! We revised the paper to include results for several training set sizes ( 160k , 80k , 32k ) and added a discussion of this point to Section 3 of the paper . Its performance relative to the other MI estimators held up with the training data size decreased . * 3.For me , the simulation on the self-consistency tests does not demonstrate a big advantage of DEMI , especially considering that a few competitors are not included ( e.g. , GM mentioned in [ Song and Ermon , 2019 ] ) .

We agree that the self-consistency tests do not demonstrate a big advantage of DEMI but rather show that most MI estimators do well on such tests . > We thank the reviewer for the suggestion on providing a representation learning demo . We performed this experiment based on Deep InfoMax ( Hjelm et al. , 2018 ) by substituting different MI estimators including DEMI and MINE . We have found that DEMI outperforms MINE and the other MI estimators on the downstream CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 classification task . We describe this experiment in the updated manuscript . * 4.It seems from Fig.1 , the advantage of the estimator becomes more obvious with the increase of dimension . Can authors provide some explanation or theoretical analysis ? * > To be more precise , the improvements offered by our estimator are more pronounced for high values of MI , which is more easily realized in high dimensional settings . As we discuss in the Introduction , the estimates that rely on variational lower bounds are bounded from above by O ( log N ) , where N is the number of sample pairs ( Song & Ermon , 2019 ; McAllester & Stratos , 2020 ) . For the same number of training sample pairs , the estimators become increasingly inaccurate for high MI setups . The accuracy of our estimator is governed by the ability of the classifier to match true log odds values in the test set , which in turn depends on ( i ) the number of training sample pairs and ( ii ) the capacity of the neural architecture used in training . Thus the quality of our estimates is subject to the classical issues of model capacity and overfitting in deep learning . We leave theoretical analysis ( which is closely related to the classifier \u2019 s convergence to the true separating boundary for a general hypothesis class ) for future work . We also note that for low MI values relative to the size of the training set , our ( and other ) estimators could overestimate MI , as can be seen in the case of 20-dimensional Gaussian variables in Fig.1.We expanded the Introduction and Experiments sections to comment on this . * 5.It seems to me the work is prepared in a quick time . There are a few typos . The clarity and location of figures can be improved . * > We thank the reviewer for the suggestion . We carefully proofread the paper , fixed typos , and improved the figures throughout the paper ."}, "3": {"review_id": "3LujMJM9EMp-3", "review_text": "Seems like the most direct way to estimate mutual information using a classifier .
