The authors should resubmit once the comparisons suggested by the reviewers have been added to the paper.", "reviews": [{"review_id": "YZrQKLHFhv3-0", "review_text": "The paper proposes the use of mixed image sizes during training . They argue empirically that such an approach improves generalization for both fixed image size ( e.g.224 in ImageNet ) as well as for variable image size . The proposed training algorithm maintains the same computational budget at each step by either changing the batch size or by using more/less augmentation . They show that adjusting the batch size leads to a faster training but using augmentation leads to a better test accuracy ( hence a tradeoff ) . However , in order for their proposed method to work , the authors also propose modifications to standard training procedures ( i.e.smoothing the gradient , adjusting the batchnorm layers ) but without carrying out an ablation study that shows the impact with/without each of these steps . My particular concern is in the use of `` gradient smoothing '' . If I understand it correctly , this is not very different from using momentum , which is known to reduce the variance and improve generalization . However , the authors use gradient smoothing only in their proposed method and do not use it in the baseline method ( why not ? ) . It is possible that the reported improvements ( e.g.for fixed image size ) come solely from this step . The other concern is when sampling the image size per step . The authors propose distributions that seem odd in their experiments ( e.g.why is p=0.6 for size 128 in ImageNet which is much larger than others , and why not uniform in CIFAR10 ) . It is important to know if the results are sensitive to the choice of the distribution , to make sure that the benefit is not due to random chance . Also , if this distribution needs to be fine-tuned , then the discussion about improving the training time would be meaningless . The last issue is the robustness to different image sizes . Figure 3 ( a ) shows that if the average image size during training is small , the network will perform better for small images but not for large images . Conversely , if the average image size during training is large , it will perform better for large images , but not for small images . If the concern here is around using mixed-image sizes at inference time , then the red curve in Figure 3 ( a ) shows that a fixed image size is reasonably robust . If one knows in advance that the average image size would be smaller than 224 , one can train with a fixed image size that is smaller . One minor last remark ( feel free to ignore ) regarding the motivation : the authors study the correlation between the full gradients for the same image with different sizes , on the one hand , and for different images with the same size , on the other hand . They conclude that the first case ( different sizes ) shows a stronger correlation , which is true according to Table 2 , but this statement omits the fact that most correlations were low anyway . For example , for partially trained network , it is 0.08 vs. 0.02 . I do not think that one can use such figures to conclude that `` smaller image gradients can be used as an estimate to the full image gradients '' . The improvement in test accuracy is very promising but I believe , some ablation is needed to identify exactly where this improvement comes from and whether it can be obtained using simpler approach ( e.g.smoothing the gradient alone or using augmentation alone , etc ) .", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We thank the reviewer for the detailed and helpful feedback . Regarding gradient smoothing ( GS ) vs momentum -- the key aspect of this method is to reduce the amount of noise in gradient norm , as it varies when computed using different batch-sizes in each step . One way to think of it is as a momentum factor over gradient norm , without impacting gradient direction . GS is not required when batch size is fixed throughout training as in baseline or D+ regime . We will make the distinction clearer between GS and momentum . Sampling image size -- the choice for sampling probability was guided by the need to reduce the average image size , to allow increased batch/duplicate factor . To select the most promising regimes , we simply cross-validated from a pool of 4-5 options . We will add more info regarding this process . Regarding robustness to different image sizes this is a good point and another value of our work , as it allows us to design a training regime targeting inference performance of a range of possible sizes . So while fixed image size at training may allow good results over a narrow range around that size , we can improve it by offering better coverage and ensure good performance even when inference image size varies ( same model for different sizes ) .

The former allows for smaller total training costs than conventional single-scale training , while the latter maintains the total training costs but improves the final performance . Several training improvement methods are introduced to improve the multi-scale training . Paper 's strengths - The paper is quite well-written . - Code and models are provided for reproducibility . - Gradient smoothing is a nice way to mitigate the variability of gradient statistics resulted from different input sizes . As far as I know , this is quite novel , particularly in the context of multi-scale training .

One of the straightforward ways to do multi-scale training in object detection is to select different input sizes even for the images within the same batch ( by padding zeros for the smaller images ) . Alternatively , one could sample different input sizes for different GPU batches ( all images within a GPU share the same size ) while doing multiple-GPU training . - The three training improvements ( step-wise size sampling , gradient smoothing and batch-norm calibration ) are what separate this paper from prior work but they are not extensively evaluated . Some of them are briefly evaluated in the appendix and some of their effects are just briefly mentioned in the method section . They ought to appear in the experimental section of the main paper . Gradient smoothing seems like a nice idea but it is unclear how important it is given that there is only one figure ( Fig.7 ) showing its impact on the performance . - This paper strives to increase the number of batch samples given a fixed budget of computational and time resources for per iteration step . I wonder why this should be limited to the cost of an iteration step but not the entire training cost from all epochs/iterations . It makes more sense to measure the cost for the entire training process which accurately tells how much is spent to train the model until convergence . - In Sec.5.1 , the size ratios for different datasets are carefully chosen based on cross-validation . This makes it hard to directly apply MixSize to other datasets or settings without going through this step . It also adds additional computations which defeat the purpose of increasing batch size to maintain the same training cost as conventional single-scale training . - Using separate BatchNorm statistics for multi-scale inputs/features has been explored in the following papers ( published at least few months before ICLR deadline ) .

The authors apply this approach to several architectures and three datasets , and show that they can achieve or improve the same accuracy as the baselines but much faster ; or achieve better results with the same computational budget . == Pros == + The authors conducted their experiments using three different datasets ( Cifar10 , Cifar100 and ImageNet ) , and six different architectures ( ResNet44 , ResNet50 , WideResNet , DenseNet and EfficientNet ) . + The proposed approach outperforms the baselines consistently across the 8 pairs of ( dataset , architecture ) that they have studied . In addition , MixSize can be easily implemented ( the authors also provide a PyTorch implementation ) . + The authors investigate different `` tricks '' to apply during training when using MixSize to stabilize training or achieving better results . For instance , they compared randomly sampling the size from a distribution ( as they propose ) versus increasing the image resolution as training progresses , and showed that randomly sampling yields slightly better results . + Figure 3a seems to suggest that MixSize yields more robust classifiers under a wide range of image sizes . The area under the `` Mixed S=144 '' curve seems to be larger than the area under the `` Fixed S=224 '' . However , further experimentation is needed to confirm this , since the area of the `` Mixed S=208 '' seems closer to `` Fixed S=224 '' , and in any case the maximum image size was capped around 415 . == Cons == - On of the claimed contributions is : `` Faster training vs. high accuracy . We show that reducing the average image size at train- ing leads to a trade-off between the time required to train the model and its final accuracy . `` . However , I would not consider this a novel contribution , since the trade-off between speed and accuracy is well-known . In fact , the authors cite Huang et al . ( 2018 ) and Szegedy et al . ( 2016 ) which already showed this . EfficientNet is another well-known architecture that takes advantage of this fact . - In the intro , the authors claim `` Touvron et al . ( 2019 ) demonstrated that networks trained on specific image resolutions perform poorly on other image sizes at evaluation time , as confirmed in Figure 1 '' . This is inaccurate , since Touvron et al . ( 2019 ) actually show that slightly increasing the test resolution improves accuracy , due to the discrepancy in object sizes introduced by data augmentation ( cropping ) . In fact , Figure 1 shows the same effect ( model trained with 224 res , achieves best results with 284 eval image size ) . The statement in the introduction is again contradicted at the end of the first paragraph in Section 2.1 . - The authors do not report any statistical significance metric . Some datasets have very close results , so it 's hard to tell whether the improvements are ( statistically ) significant or not . - Poor captions in figures and tables . For instance , the difference between solid lines and dashed lines is only explained at the very last figure in the appending ( Figure 7 ) . Also , the caption of Figure 3 reads `` Test accuracy on validation set '' which is ambiguous : Is it a typo , or is it that the authors report the results on the 50k validation set of ImageNet ( and use some smaller subset of the training set as validation ) ? == Reasons for score == Although the proposed approach is simple and consistently improves the baseline results , I 'm not convinced that the originality and significance of the work is enough for it to be accepted . Regarding originality , there is a plethora of works exploring the trade-offs between image size and accuracy . The most similar works are Howard ( 2018 ) and Karras et al . ( 2017 ) , which increase the image size through training . It 's not clear that random sampling offers a much better result , judging from Figure 8 in Appending E , if one compares the accuracy of `` Small- > Large '' strategy at 125k steps ( possibly before the last increase in size ) . Regarding significance , if one restricts the analysis to the best architectures in each dataset , the increase in accuracy does not seem to be very large . Cifar10 : 98.16 % - > 98.32 % ( AmoebaNet ) , ImageNet : 76.32 % - > 76.53 % ( EfficientNet-B0 ) . Cifar100 shows a larger improvement , but the authors did not use AmoebaNet ( which worked best in Cifar10 ) for some unknown reason .

The authors assume the training budget , represented as S_i^2 * B_i * D_i ( i.e. , spatial sample size , the number of batched distinct samples and the duplicates for each distinct sample ) , to be a fixed constant during training step i . Under such an assumption , two mixed-size training scenarios are considered , one for training acceleration and the other for improved model generalization ability . The authors additionally use step-wise image size sampling , gradient smoothing , and per-size BN calibration to enhance the model performance under the above two mixed-size training scenarios . Experimental validation is performed on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets using diverse CNN structures . Mixed-size training is a critical problem and the methods proposed in this paper are interesting . My main concerns to this paper are as follows . Critical related works and comparison are missing . Mixed-size training of CNNs for image classification are not new . Here are some recent works , however they are missed by the authors . \u201c Resolution Adaptive Networks for Efficient Inference \u201d , in CVPR 2020 \u201c Resolution Switchable Networks for Runtime Efficient Image Recognition \u201d , in ECCV 2020 . \u201c MutualNet : Adaptive ConvNet via Mutual Learning from Network Width and Resolution \u201d , in ECCV 2020 . Besides , as described by the authors , NeurIPS 2019 paper \u201c Fixing the train-test resolution discrepancy \u201d also considers how to enhance the performance of CNN models when applying them with different input image sizes . But a performance comparison is missing . To show the advantages of this paper , thorough discussion and performance comparison with the above works are necessary . Taking ResNet-50 trained on ImageNet as an instance , I notice that the proposed method shows obviously worse accuracy compared to some of these works . Another critical baseline is also missing . In page 8 , \u201c We note that for original fixed-size regimes this calibration procedure resulted , with degraded results and so we report accuracy without calibration for these models \u201d . To my understanding , this is somewhat weird . Why BN calibration does not work on the other image sizes when the model is trained with a fixed image size ? It is not clear . Furthermore , in NeurIPS 2019 paper \u201c Fixing the train-test resolution discrepancy \u201d , this line of methods work pretty well . Such a BN calibration should server as another baseline for more fair comparison . Regarding B+ design How about the wall-clock training cost ( in hours ) instead of the number of iterations/epochs ? How about the performance of applying \u201c scale the learning rate linearly \u201d to train the baseline model ? How about model transfer ability ? Only image classification tasks are considered in the experiments . How about the performance of the trained backbone models , when transferring them in the downstream tasks , such as object detection and semantic segmentation ? Can performance gain be transferred ? Others Is there any principled way regarding the size sampling strategy ? The current strategy is based on manual setting , which limits its use in real applications .

The fact that no statistical significance metrics are reported , does not help to discern whether the improvements are meaningful or not .", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We thank the reviewer for the detailed and helpful feedback . On `` trade-off between speed and accuracy '' : We note that all mentioned works are suggesting a modified model structure . In this work , we suggested a modification to the training technique , such that existing models can benefit from the use of multiple image scales . Thus we were first to show trade-off in training regime for , rather than model size . We thank the reviewer for his comment regarding improved resolution with increased size as cited from Touvron et al . ( 2019 ) .What we meant was that beyond a small increase over trained size ( for which accuracy may improve ) , we see clear degradation of the model , which can not be ( currently ) fixed without fine-tuning as Touvron et al.suggested . We will make this more clear . We will make captions more clear . As for Figure 3 , we measured accuracy on ImageNet 's validation set , training was done on all training set ( no additional validation split here ) We will add statistical significance scores to the results ."}, "3": {"review_id": "YZrQKLHFhv3-3", "review_text": "This paper presents a mixed-size CNN training scheme , using several different input image sizes for one single model training . The authors assume the training budget , represented as S_i^2 * B_i * D_i ( i.e. , spatial sample size , the number of batched distinct samples and the duplicates for each distinct sample ) , to be a fixed constant during training step i . Under such an assumption , two mixed-size training scenarios are considered , one for training acceleration and the other for improved model generalization ability . The authors additionally use step-wise image size sampling , gradient smoothing , and per-size BN calibration to enhance the model performance under the above two mixed-size training scenarios . Experimental validation is performed on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets using diverse CNN structures . Mixed-size training is a critical problem and the methods proposed in this paper are interesting . My main concerns to this paper are as follows . Critical related works and comparison are missing . Mixed-size training of CNNs for image classification are not new . Here are some recent works , however they are missed by the authors . \u201c Resolution Adaptive Networks for Efficient Inference \u201d , in CVPR 2020 \u201c Resolution Switchable Networks for Runtime Efficient Image Recognition \u201d , in ECCV 2020 . \u201c MutualNet : Adaptive ConvNet via Mutual Learning from Network Width and Resolution \u201d , in ECCV 2020 . Besides , as described by the authors , NeurIPS 2019 paper \u201c Fixing the train-test resolution discrepancy \u201d also considers how to enhance the performance of CNN models when applying them with different input image sizes . But a performance comparison is missing . To show the advantages of this paper , thorough discussion and performance comparison with the above works are necessary . Taking ResNet-50 trained on ImageNet as an instance , I notice that the proposed method shows obviously worse accuracy compared to some of these works . Another critical baseline is also missing . In page 8 , \u201c We note that for original fixed-size regimes this calibration procedure resulted , with degraded results and so we report accuracy without calibration for these models \u201d . To my understanding , this is somewhat weird . Why BN calibration does not work on the other image sizes when the model is trained with a fixed image size ? It is not clear . Furthermore , in NeurIPS 2019 paper \u201c Fixing the train-test resolution discrepancy \u201d , this line of methods work pretty well . Such a BN calibration should server as another baseline for more fair comparison . Regarding B+ design How about the wall-clock training cost ( in hours ) instead of the number of iterations/epochs ? How about the performance of applying \u201c scale the learning rate linearly \u201d to train the baseline model ? How about model transfer ability ? Only image classification tasks are considered in the experiments . How about the performance of the trained backbone models , when transferring them in the downstream tasks , such as object detection and semantic segmentation ? Can performance gain be transferred ? Others Is there any principled way regarding the size sampling strategy ? The current strategy is based on manual setting , which limits its use in real applications . I suggest the authors to also provide precise accuracy numbers , etc . regarding some figures ( e.g. , figure 1 , figure 4 ) shown in the paper . Generally , I am on the fence , to this paper . I encourage the authors to address the questions I raised above .", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We thank the reviewer for the detailed and helpful feedback . Answering raised concerns : 1 ) Missing previous work - we thank the reviewer and will add the missing recent studies . We note , however , that all mentioned works are suggesting modified model structure ( thus similar to works we cited in the introduction -Takahashi et al. , 2017 ; Xu et al. , 2014 ; Zhang et al. , 2019 ) . In this work , we suggested a modification to the training technique , such that existing models can benefit from the use of multiple image scales . We 've added a comparison with previous works to Appendix . 2 ) BN calibration does not work for fixed scale trained networks - we do not know the reason for this property ( calibration on these models simply yielded worse results and so were not used on baseline ) . We speculate that changing image scale post-training simply requires finetuning to the network beyond first and second statistical moments ( which BN calibration allows ) and so light parameter training is required ( as done by Touvron et al . ) 3 ) As mentioned in section 5.2 , wall-clock times scales similarly to steps , as we balanced compute ( through batch size ) for all configuration . We will add the exact number in hours . 4 ) Measuring our models on subsequent detection tasks did not show significant improvement ( performed similarly to baseline ) , we will add this info to our work . 5 ) We currently do not have any principled way to determine sampling size , but found cross-validation to be effective to select best-performing regimes ."}}
