Below , we address the weaknesses of the paper the reviewer pointed out . Please also check our revised paper . Re.1 : In order to explain/motivate Assumption 1 further , we have added comments after Assumption 1 and Theorem 2 explaining what this assumption means for $ L=2 $ and how it helps proof of Theorem 2 . As for the conditions on initial directions , it is true that the conditions only provide sufficient conditions for convergence of loss , hence stronger/more restrictive than the convergence assumption . However , we believe proving ( instead of assuming ) convergence of loss is meaningful because there are known examples where linear neural networks never converge to the true solution under some initializations [ Bartlett et al. , 2018 ; Arora et al. , 2019a ] ( please see Remark 1 ) . Given such examples , it is not clear a priori whether a given initialization direction will satisfy the convergence assumption . In contrast , our theorems provide sufficient conditions on initialization for convergence , which is easier to test . Also , as we discussed in Remark 1 , our sufficient condition can lead to an initialization scheme ( setting $ v_L = 0 $ and randomly sampling others ) that ensures global convergence of loss with probability 1 . The conditions on the matrices in Theorem 7 are needed for proving convergence of loss to zero . This is a generalization of the zero-asymmetric initialization ( setting $ \\bar W_1 = \\dots = \\bar W_ { L-1 } = I_d $ and $ \\bar w_L = 0 $ ) proposed by [ Wu et al. , 2019 ] .

We included these classification experiments because they suggest an important future direction of research , rather than as corroboration of our theoretical results on classification . Re.3 : The motivation for studying the single data point lies in the fact that we can analyze any 2-layer networks that can be represented in the linear tensor network formulation . Although single point is restrictive , we believe our analysis provides insights for understanding networks that do not satisfy the orthogonal decomposition assumption ( Assumption 1 ) , e.g. , convolutional networks with small filters .

This formulation is mainly used under the special case of linear networks with \u201c orthogonal \u201d tensor representation to provide a unified proof of many existing results on the implicit bias of gradient descent under different architectures . Overall , the tensor formulation is an interesting and new ( to my knowledge ) abstraction . On the other hand , in terms of writing , I found the key ideas behind the unified results regarding implicit bias to be a bit obscured within the tensor formulation . Since this paper is positioned as a new formulation with a goal of providing useful generalized abstraction , I believe it would be beneficial to be more explicit about the core ideas and their connections to existing concepts . In particular , have the following concrete suggestions : 1 . Although the tensor formulation is more general , introducing the results including the orthogonality condition for the case of L=2 layers first would be very useful . For 2 layers the analysis only requires matrix algebra and it is easy to motivate the generalization and identify the key unifying concepts . 2.The condition on orthogonality of tensor formulation , which unifies existing results on diagonal and convolutional networks have an interesting connection to linear diagonal networks : I believe the condition is equivalent ( in the sense of if and only if ) to stating that there is exists * some * orthonormal transformation of the layer parameters v_l ( v_l - > U_lv_l ) and some linear transformation of input x ( x- > Sx ) , such that after the transformations , the networks behaves like a linear diagonal network . Thus , at the core , networks with orthogonal tensor representation are equivalent diagonal networks in a different parametrization . Moreover , from the proof , one can also show that this specific of change in parametrization does not affect the gradient flow path , i.e , that gradient flow on v_l is equivalent to gradient flow on the orthonormal linear transformation of the parameters tilde { v } _l=U_lv_l . It would be useful to discuss the connection between the orthogonality condition and diagonal networks explicitly in the text as a motivation/clarification for the orthogonality condition or as proof sketch . 2b.Another connection is that , for L=2 where M ( x ) is a matrix , the orthogonality condition is also equivalent to commutativity of M ( x_i ) for the dataset inputs x_i -- this also highlights why for a single datapoint the analysis goes through as M ( x ) is a single matrix , which is commutative with itself . 3.One of the main differences from the existing work is claimed to be the fact that this analysis does not make assumptions on convergence of loss . However , the main theorems introduce additional assumptions on initialization that effectively guarantee convergence of loss . It is not clear if this assumption is more useful than assuming the loss converges -- the assumption on initialization is more easy to control , however such constraints on initialization in turn affect the implicit bias explicitly . For e.g. , in regression , the effect is explicit in the definition of Q , and for classification although the asymptotic direction is independent of initialization , recent work on diagonal networks show that the initialization has strong effects on the convergence to the asymptotic max margin solution ( see https : //arxiv.org/abs/2007.06738 ) .", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "reply_text": "We appreciate the reviewer for the feedback and insightful comments .

Due to space constraints , we could not add separate statements for $ L=2 $ ; however , as you can see in our revision , we have added comments explaining the $ L=2 $ cases after ( 6 ) , in the beginning of Sec 4.2 , and after Assumption 1 . Re.2 : After the statement of Theorem 2 , we have also added the connection of orthogonal decomposition ( Assumption 1 ) and linear diagonal networks . Thank you for the suggestion . Re.2b : We believe there is a slight misunderstanding here . Assumption 1 does not necessarily mean that , in $ L = 2 $ , two data tensors $ M ( x_1 ) $ and $ M ( x_2 ) $ commute . For example , in case of full-length linear convolutional networks ( $ d = 3 $ ) , we have $ M ( x ) = \\\\begin { bmatrix } [ x ] _1 & [ x ] _2 & [ x ] _3 \\\\\\\\ [ x ] _2 & [ x ] _3 & [ x ] _1 \\\\\\\\ [ x ] _3 & [ x ] _1 & [ x ] _2 \\\\end { bmatrix } $ , and one can quickly check that $ M ( [ 1,0,0 ] ) $ and $ M ( [ 0,1,0 ] ) $ do not commute . Instead , the key to Assumption 1 is that the singular vectors ( in $ U_l $ \u2019 s ) of the data tensor $ M ( x ) $ are fixed and independent of the data point $ x $ . This makes our proofs ( of Theorems 2 and 5 ) work , and it is also the reason why the single point analyses ( Theorems 3 and 6 ) work for networks that do not satisfy Assumption 1 .
