All reviewers thought that looking at the last-iterate convergence of the HB method was interesting and that the proofs, while simple, were interestingly novel. Several concerns were raised by the quality of the writing. Several were addressed in a revision and the rebuttal. While R1 did not update their score, the AC thinks that the rebuttal has addressed appropriately their initial concerns. The AC recommends the paper for acceptance, *but* it is important that the authors make an appropriate careful pass over their paper for the camera ready version.\n\n### comments about the write-up\n\n- The paper still contains many typos (e.g. missing $1/t$ term in the average after equation (2); many misspelled words, etc.), please carefully proofread your paper again.\n- The AC agrees with R1 that the quality of presentation still needs improvement. $\\beta_{1t}$ is still used in the introduction without being defined -- please define it properly first e.g. \n- The word \"optimal\" and \"optimality\" is usually misused in the manuscript. To refer to the convergence rate of an optimization algorithm, the standard terminology is to talk about the \"suboptimality\" or the \"error\" (e.g. see the terminology used by the cited [Harvey et al. 2019, Jain et al. 2019] papers). For example, one would say that the error or suboptimality of SGD has a $O(1/\\sqrt{t})$ convergence rate. Saying \"optimality of\" or \"optimal individual convergence rate\" is quite confusing, and should be corrected. The adjective \"optimal\" (when talking about a convergence rate) should be restricted to when a matching lower bound exists.\n- Finally, the text introducing the experimental section should be fixed to clarify the actual results and motivation. Specifically, the \"validate the correctness of our convergence analysis\" only applies in the convex setting. I recommend that a high level description of the convex experiment and the main message of the results is moved from the appendix to the main paper there (there is space). And then, the deep learning experiments can be introduced as just investigating the practical performance of the suggested coefficient schedule for HB.", "reviews": [{"review_id": "L7WD8ZdscQ5-0", "review_text": "The authors investigate the convergence of the projected Heavy-ball method ( and an adaptive variant ) for convex problems with convex constraints .

Also , in the paragraph for the paper 's 3rd contribution , it says decaying \\beta_1 , t goes to 1 . It is not a decaying but increasing parameter . c ) - There are two appendices , one at the end of the main part , and the other part is in a separate file . d ) - Two related works which haven \u2019 t been considered in related work Sebbouh O. , et.al . On the convergence of the Stochastic Heavy Ball Method Sun , T. et . la. , Non-Ergodic Convergence Analysis of Heavy-Ball Algorithms 2- In terms of contributions : a ) - I don \u2019 t think dropping a log ( t ) terms in an analysis of a method means acceleration . Usually , Log ( t ) term appears due to some technical difficulties in the analysis and also in practice when training a model is not a large value . b ) - Since you compare the HB method with SGD , I suggest putting the proof for stochastic HB instead of the deterministic case . c ) - In the experimental section , it would be nice to see the results on bigger datasets like Imagenet and also different tasks such as NLP models . Moreover , for SGD you set the step size \\alpha_t to be fixed , which theoretically SGD won \u2019 t converge in this situation . To be fair , similar to your sep-size , which is decreasing \\alpha_t for SGD should be decreasing with an appropriate rate . Finally , since you run the experiments for 5 runs , it would be useful to add the error bar to your graphs .", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Thank you for your efforts reviewing our paper and providing helpful comments and suggestions . We are looking forward to hearing your response . A1 : Thanks for your suggestions . We will do our best to revise the manuscript to make it ready to be published . Specifically , we have used momentum parameter to take the place of its specific value . a ) We have given the full name of SGD . b ) Sorry for the typos , and we have corrected them in the revised version . c ) The content of the first appendix has been moved into Section 3 , i.e. , the simple but key proof in this paper is included in Section 3 , and other details are given in the supplementary material . d ) They restrict the convex problems to be smooth while we focus on the nonsmooth convex problems . What is more , we derive the optimal convergence . Of course , we would like to cite these works in the revised version . A2 : a ) A concrete example was constructed in ( Harvey et al. , 2019 ) , in which the error of the final iterate of deterministic GD is exactly $ \\Omega ( log ( T ) /T ) $ . Thus , the effect of acceleration can be clearly illustrated on this specific example . We have included this toy example in the revised experimental section . We don \u2019 t agree that log ( t ) term appears due to some technical difficulties in the analysis . In fact , it has been proved that the log ( t ) term is indeed necessary in the convergence rate of GD ( Harvey et al. , 2019 ) . Thus , how to drop the log ( t ) term remains a challenging problem in machine learning community . b ) Thanks for suggestions . To make the assumptions relatively simple and our proof easy to understand , we only focus on the deterministic cases . The general stochastic and adaptive settings have been provided in the original supplementary material . c ) Our deep learning experiments are conducted by following a recent ICLR paper ( Wang et al. , 2020 ) , where only CIFAR10 , CIFAR100 , MNIST are considered to demonstrate the effectiveness of their methods . Of course , we also would like to see the results on bigger dataset . Unfortunately , our poor hardware conditions prevent us to finish this work in a short time . We respectfully disagree with the reviewer about the convergence of SGD . In fact , for SGD , even if we suitably choose the time-varying step size $ \\alpha_t $ , the convergence of SGD is still not guaranteed due to the nonconvexity in this situation . Decreasing $ \\alpha_t $ for SGD with an appropriate rate is surely a good idea . Unfortunately , it is almost impossible to get this appropriate rate in deep learning tasks . As far as we know , constant $ \\alpha $ for SGD has been used in almost the deep learning experiments such as ( Wang et al. , 2020 ) . We have also added the error bar to our graphs ."}, "3": {"review_id": "L7WD8ZdscQ5-3", "review_text": "Summary : This paper provides the convergence analysis of the Heavy-ball method with the individual convergence and provides the convergence of its adaptive version . Pros : 1.The motivation is interesting , most of time we use the last iteration while most of theorem can only provide convergence result for the average output . I am glad to see that the theoretical proof of the individual convergence for stochastic Heavy-ball method is studied in this paper , 2 . The convergence result of HB methods achieved in this paper is 1/\\sqrt ( t ) which is better the optimal result of SGD . This demonstrate the advantage of momentum-based methods . 3.Their proof is different form all the existing analysis of averaging convergence . Cons : 1.It will be much better if the author can explain more on the difference between the current proof and the existing proof . Overall , I tend to accept this paper . However I am not an expert on this area and I will not be sad if this paper is rejected by others .", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Thank you for your efforts reviewing our paper and providing helpful comments and suggestions . Pros : A : Thanks for your positive evaluation . Cons : A : The main novelty of our individual convergence analysis is that we employ the momentum term to establish a recursion between $ f ( w_t ) - f ( w ) $ and $ f ( w_ { t-1 } ) - f ( w ) $ , in which the time-varying momentum parameters are suitably selected . The existing proof mainly concerned about the bound of regret , in which only $ f ( w_t ) - f ( w ) $ is required to consider ."}}
