As proposed by our reviewer , we analyzed CNN internals under explicit boundary handling ( Innamorati et al . ) using the image de-bayering example for which the authors [ provided their source code ] ( http : //geometry.cs.ucl.ac.uk/projects/2018/learning-edge/ ) . Our observations are ( see supplementary/rebuttal/explicit_border_handling for backing material ) : * The feature maps still exhibit artifacts originating from the boundaries . This is caused , in part , by potential discontinuity that takes places output when assembling the output of an interior filter and its corresponding boundary filters into one feature map . * The average 3x3 filter in each boundary filter set expectedly tends to resemble the corresponding boundary condition ( e.g.top-left corner or bottom edge ) . However , the average interior filter still exhibits asymmetries which is likely influenced by the above-mentioned discontinuity . Nevertheless , the method can serve as a \u201c learned \u201d padding scheme if the discontinuity issue is addressed , e.g.by incorporating continuity in the learning objective of the boundary filters or by employing similar ideas as in the recently proposed [ Continuous Convolution Layer ] ( https : //arxiv.org/abs/2006.11120 ) . As such , it deserves further investigation as a competitive approach . Regarding foveation patterns , we do think those should be factored in the decision when choosing a padding method for a specific problem . * * We did observe that a uniform foveation map can have a positive influence on performance * * . For example , mirror padding performs consistently better under `` ` SYMMETRIC `` ` mode ( uniform foveation map ) than under `` ` REFLECT `` ` mode ( non-uniform map ) [ in the experiments conducted by Liu et al ] ( https : //github.com/NVIDIA/partialconv # comparison-with-zero-padding-reflection-padding-and-replication-padding-for-5-runs ) on five different ImageNet classifiers . ( Note that `` ` REPLICATION `` ` is equivalent to `` ` SYMMETRIC `` ` mirror padding in all of those experiments because the padding amount is only 1 pixel which is applied around the feature maps to warrant `` ` SAME `` ` padding with 3x3 filters ) .\\ However , besides dictating the foveation behavior , the padding method directly impacts the formation of feature map artifacts . This can have a stronger influence on the outcome , depending on the characteristics of the task and the dataset at hand . Therefore , * * we could not make a claim about which padding method is universally superior as we summarized in Section 8 * * . Note that : * The foveation maps are computed under constant weights ( for the purpose of * counting * input-output paths ) , and hence the connection between foveation effects and CNN internals is more nuanced in trained networks than what these maps suggest . * There are subtle nuances in the uniformity of foveation maps as we illustrated in appendix E in the paragraphs titled \u201c Which kernel cells these ops utilize ? \u201d ( cf.the illustrations for circular and symmetric mirror padding ) . On a similar note , applying no padding ( VALID mode ) diminishes the contribution of large parts of the input , as evident in its foveation map , which drastically impacts the accuracy of standard CNNs . However , such limitations might potentially be possible to overcome if the CNN is used in combination with a suited attention mechanism . Specifically , future work can investigate the use of padding-free CNNs as building blocks in [ Vision Transformers ] ( https : //openreview.net/forum ? id=YicbFdNTTy ) to mimic foveation + eye gazes in human vision , while categorically eliminating padding-induced artifacts . We appreciate the suggestions by our reviewer which open avenues to learn `` smooth '' boundary handling methods and to analyze more closely how foveation patterns impact CNN internals ."}, {"review_id": "m1CD7tPubNy-2", "review_text": "Summary of Submission : This submission points out that 0-padding in convolutional networks induces areas where responses for object detections are significantly decreased . This leads to misdetections of small objects . The submission studies the case of traffic lights . Analysis of filter response maps at various layers of the network and analysis of the average filter weights show the effect of the 0-padding . Making the padding symmetric and using mirror or reflection padding are shown to tackle the issue . Update after Rebuttal : I 'd like to thanks the authors for addressing the comments really thoroughly . The additional experiments using anti aliased networks are indeed very interesting . I agree with AnonReviewer4 that some of the material in this submission is probably known to people already . However , I do strongly believe that many people are unaware of the impact and importance of these effects and therefore I believe publication of this content is important . Strengths : - Padding is omni-present in modern CNN architectures and its effect is not often analyzed . This submission contains a thorough analysis , points out the problem with 0-padding and shows how various alternatives show significant improvement . - Especially the analysis of the asymmetric padding that leads to asymmetric filters in Section 5 is very interesting . - The text is well written and easy to follow . Weaknesses : - The introduction describes how the issue with the 0-padding leads to drastic differences in object detection between frames in a video . There has been work [ 39 ] which also showed that aliasing in CNNs causes these effects which does not seem to be discussed in this manuscript . What would happen to the effects of the 0-padding if an anti-aliased network would be used ? - The experiments are focused on traffic lights . Given the generality of the issue presented in the manuscript I feel that additional experiments with other small objects or related problems could have been included . Explanation of Rating : This submission describes a problem with 0-padding that significantly impacts an important problem and shows how to mitigate the situation . Therefore I recommend accepting this submission . Minor Comment : Page 5 : layer in RseNet - > ResNet", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "reply_text": "We thank our reviewer for encouraging us to study the relation between aliasing and padding effects . We compared CNN internals between baseline ResNet / VGG models and their antialiased counterparts [ made available by Zhang et al ] ( https : //github.com/adobe/antialiased-cnns ) . Our observations are ( see supplementary/rebuttal/antialiased_cnns for backing material ) : * While the feature maps inevitably develop spatial artifacts under zero padding , we found that * * antialiasing generally smoothens these artifacts , in particular , line artifacts became less prominent * * . * * * Interestingly , the asymmetry of certain average filters in ResNet and MobileNet models is reduced in the antialiased versions * * . This asymmetry is rooted in the uneven application of 0-padding during downsampling , induced by training the models on 224x224 images . Antialiasing seems increasingly able to mitigate this effect at deeper layers , where the asymmetry practically vanishes in all six models we analyzed . * * This is in line with the shift-consistency maps by Zhang ( ICLR 2019 ) * * that demonstrate how antialiased models remain shift robust at deeper layers unlike the baseline models . * * We think this ability is explainable by how BlurPool smoothens sharp edges * * during downsampling , in turn , reducing the overrepresentation of left and top zero edges in the presence of uneven padding - we will point to the need to examine these effects in future work . * Intrigued by the previous point , * * we quantified the shift consistency of ImageNet models we trained on 225x225 images * * using the metric proposed by Zhang ( ICLR 2019 ) . * * The consistency did improve for all of these models * * , compared with the baseline ones trained on 224x224 images . This suggests that the asymmetry in the filters makes the model less shift-robust and can be , in part , the underlying mechanism which the model uses to implicitly encode / overfit spatial information . We will expand the discussion section to report the above initial insights and to invite further analysis of the synergies between padding and aliasing effects in CNNs . We selected traffic-light detection mainly to demonstrate how spatial artifacts look like and to qualitatively illustrate how they can mute small object detection . We included a collection of examples of these artifacts in multiple domains ( see supplementary/further_CNN_examples ) and demonstrated a similar interference in the face detection example . We added one more example to that collection to showcase the impact of padding artifacts in image inpainting and to demonstrate significant qualitative improvement after training under mirror padding . To analyze the effects of unevenly-applied padding , we opted for ImageNet classification with ResNet / MobileNet models for the following reasons : * Standard * * ResNet / MobileNet models do perform zero padding at downsampling layers * * , the culprit of potential asymmetry , and widely used as `` trunk '' models in practice , making the analysis potentially relevant to a broad audience . * The standard * * training size * * is * fixed * to 224x224 which * * gives rise to unevenly-applied 0-padding at * every * downsampling layer * * of these models . Mitigating it only requires increasing the size to 225x225 , hence avoiding excessive padding that would dilute the effect we are after . In contrast , RCNN-based detectors are trained on COCO using * variable * input size to leverage the full resolution of the training data . This dilutes the effect we are after because 1 ) the chance to unevenly apply 0-padding is statistically reduced by 50 % , and 2 ) rectifying arbitrary input sizes to warrant even application of padding at all layers can require excessive input padding . * Both * * the nature of a classification task and the image statistics of ImagNet arguably encourage the emergence of symmetric mean filters * * . This might not be the case in Chinese character classification , where vertical strokes dominate the training data , or in drivable-area detection , where roads dominate certain parts of traffic scenes . * ImagNet classification serves as * * a versatile testbed * * that makes it easy to demonstrate the effects we measure and to compare them with other effects ( e.g.aliasing ) . The nuances of more involved computer-vision tasks ( e.g.inpainting masks ) make it a bit harder to isolate these effects . We nevertheless hinted about the need `` to closely examine the implications of spatial bias and foveation in various applications '' , perhaps in dedicated studies within ML sub-communities , and tried to focus on generic learning-representation aspects and their practical implications ."}, {"review_id": "m1CD7tPubNy-3", "review_text": "Summary : This paper does empirical analysis on an object detector , esp . how it fails due to slight shift of objects in videos . By using different padding schemes for conv filters , the authors find the padding scheme is the root for such failures . Update after rebuttal : The author responses and manuscript revisions have addressed most of my concerns . Now I lean towards acceptance . Reasons for score : 1 . This paper is not written professionally . The introduction is very short . The following sections are more like experimental notes than a technical paper . 2.The analysis is mostly based on a single use case , i.e.an SSD object detector for traffic lights . This study is highly insufficient . More use cases and application scenarios should be investigated . 3.Experimental evaluation is also highly insufficient . Only changing the input image size by 1 pixel does n't reveal much . A lot of ablation studies and changing of padding schemes should be evaluated , preferably on a few datasets of different tasks ( classification , detection , segmentation , etc . ) . Other comments : I agree that padding could lead to biases when doing downsampling using stride > 1 , as illustrated in Fig.6.However , this seems to be easily fixed by doing random image flipping as one of the data augmentations ? It would even this bias . So this issue may not be practically severe , although it is worth study per se . Minor issues : The PDF file of this paper seems to have issues . The printed characters are blurry , and acrobat reports errors when open it . But some other PDF readers can open it .", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We thank our reviewer for proposing further ablation studies . Indeed , we repeated the ImageNet experiments on two of the ResNet models , this time by expanding the input dimensions by 2 pixels ( using mean padding ) , from 224x224 to 226x226 . The improvement in top-1 ( and top-5 ) accuracy matched the one we observed when expanding the input by 1 pixel only ( from 224x224 to 225x225 ) : |Input Size|ResNet-18|ResNet-34| |||| 224 \u00d7 224|69.93 % ( 89.22 % ) | 73.30 % ( 91.42 % ) | |225 \u00d7 225|70.27 % ( 89.52 % ) |73.72 % ( 91.58 % ) | |226 \u00d7 226|70.07 % ( 89.52 % ) |73.59 % ( 91.57 % ) | |256 \u00d7 256|70.24 % ( 89.52 % ) | N/A| * * This supports our claim that the boost is probably due to eliminating uneven application of padding and not merely due to the increase in input size * * . To further verify this observation , we expanded the input dimensions from 224x224 to 256x256 by applying 16-pixel mean padding around the input images . Training ResNet-18 on these images did not give any advantage over 225x225 inputs . > changing of padding schemes should be evaluated We did experiment with changing the padding method in ResNet-18 from zero to circular padding and training both on 224x224 images and on 225x225 images . In both cases , the accuracy improved visibly under circular padding : |Padding Method|Training on 224x224 images| Training on 225x225 images| |||| |Zero Padding|69.93 % ( 89.22 % ) |70.27 % ( 89.52 % ) | |Circular Padding|70.28 % ( 89.44 % ) |70.47 % ( 89.80 % ) | This is expected since circular padding significantly reduces feature-map artifacts that emerge under zero padding due to injecting zeros in the padding areas , as we explained in Section-7 and elaborated in Appendix D. Furthermore , training under circular padding also mitigates the asymmetry in mean filters , even when training on 224x224 images ( see Appendix C ) . This is because even when the padding is applied only at the left and top borders , padding by reusing the feature-map values prevents the disproportional presence of zeros at these borders , compared with the right and bottom borders . We included a similar analysis under mirror padding in the SSD example ( Section 7 ) . * * Our purpose is not to establish the superiority of a specific padding method * * , we did argue that the choice is problem dependent ( Section 8 ) . For example circular padding does not interfere much with ImageNet classification , since the objects tend to be mostly in the center . On the other hand , it might be less suited in small-object detection as it makes neighbors out of distant pixels ( hence our choice of mirror padding in the SSD experiment ) . * * Instead , we wanted to raise awareness about potentially harmful effects of padding in CNNs ( with a broader ML audience in mind ) , to exemplify how these could be mitigated , and to aid domain experts with a `` checklist '' of aspects to pay attention to when applying padding * * . > preferably on a few datasets of different tasks ( classification , detection , segmentation , etc . ) . In our response to AnonReviewer2 , we elaborated on the rationale behind choosing ImageNet classification and traffic-light detection to showcase our analysis and findings . > The analysis is mostly based on a single use case [ ... ] More use cases and application scenarios should be investigated . We did include a collection of examples demonstrating CNN spatial bias in multiple domains , including semantic segmentation , image colorization and inpainting , reinforcement learning , and spectrogram-based audio classification ( see supplementary/further_CNN_examples ) . > The introduction is very short . The following sections are more like experimental notes than a technical paper . We renamed the first section to \u201c Motivation \u201d to better reflect its content . Since our contribution revolves around edge cases and subtle effects in CNNs , we opted to first illustrate these cases and effects ( Sect.2-3 ) , then highlight why padding is important despite being the root cause ( Sect.4 ) , and finally demonstrate how applying padding carefully can mitigate these effects ( Sect.5-7 ) based on theoretical analysis , together with empirical results . > this seems to be easily fixed by doing random image flipping as one of the data augmentations ? Random horizontal flipping is indeed part of the ImageNet training recipe in PyTorch , which we used in our experiments . However , it does not fix the issue since the uneven application of padding ( and the bias it incurs ) takes place , more importantly , `` inside the CNN '' around the feature maps that are fed into downsampling layers . Randomly flipping feature maps is very likely to impede the learning - a dedicated study is needed to evaluate this issue . ( Note that both vertical and horizontal flipping would be needed to even out the bias ) . Finally , we thank our reviewer for reporting issues with viewing the manuscript .

However , the average interior filter still exhibits asymmetries which is likely influenced by the above-mentioned discontinuity . Nevertheless , the method can serve as a \u201c learned \u201d padding scheme if the discontinuity issue is addressed , e.g.by incorporating continuity in the learning objective of the boundary filters or by employing similar ideas as in the recently proposed [ Continuous Convolution Layer ] ( https : //arxiv.org/abs/2006.11120 ) . As such , it deserves further investigation as a competitive approach . Regarding foveation patterns , we do think those should be factored in the decision when choosing a padding method for a specific problem . * * We did observe that a uniform foveation map can have a positive influence on performance * * . For example , mirror padding performs consistently better under `` ` SYMMETRIC `` ` mode ( uniform foveation map ) than under `` ` REFLECT `` ` mode ( non-uniform map ) [ in the experiments conducted by Liu et al ] ( https : //github.com/NVIDIA/partialconv # comparison-with-zero-padding-reflection-padding-and-replication-padding-for-5-runs ) on five different ImageNet classifiers . ( Note that `` ` REPLICATION `` ` is equivalent to `` ` SYMMETRIC `` ` mirror padding in all of those experiments because the padding amount is only 1 pixel which is applied around the feature maps to warrant `` ` SAME `` ` padding with 3x3 filters ) .\\ However , besides dictating the foveation behavior , the padding method directly impacts the formation of feature map artifacts . This can have a stronger influence on the outcome , depending on the characteristics of the task and the dataset at hand . Therefore , * * we could not make a claim about which padding method is universally superior as we summarized in Section 8 * * . Note that : * The foveation maps are computed under constant weights ( for the purpose of * counting * input-output paths ) , and hence the connection between foveation effects and CNN internals is more nuanced in trained networks than what these maps suggest . * There are subtle nuances in the uniformity of foveation maps as we illustrated in appendix E in the paragraphs titled \u201c Which kernel cells these ops utilize ? \u201d ( cf.the illustrations for circular and symmetric mirror padding ) . On a similar note , applying no padding ( VALID mode ) diminishes the contribution of large parts of the input , as evident in its foveation map , which drastically impacts the accuracy of standard CNNs . However , such limitations might potentially be possible to overcome if the CNN is used in combination with a suited attention mechanism . Specifically , future work can investigate the use of padding-free CNNs as building blocks in [ Vision Transformers ] ( https : //openreview.net/forum ? id=YicbFdNTTy ) to mimic foveation + eye gazes in human vision , while categorically eliminating padding-induced artifacts . We appreciate the suggestions by our reviewer which open avenues to learn `` smooth '' boundary handling methods and to analyze more closely how foveation patterns impact CNN internals ."}, "2": {"review_id": "m1CD7tPubNy-2", "review_text": "Summary of Submission : This submission points out that 0-padding in convolutional networks induces areas where responses for object detections are significantly decreased . This leads to misdetections of small objects . The submission studies the case of traffic lights . Analysis of filter response maps at various layers of the network and analysis of the average filter weights show the effect of the 0-padding . Making the padding symmetric and using mirror or reflection padding are shown to tackle the issue . Update after Rebuttal : I 'd like to thanks the authors for addressing the comments really thoroughly . The additional experiments using anti aliased networks are indeed very interesting . I agree with AnonReviewer4 that some of the material in this submission is probably known to people already . However , I do strongly believe that many people are unaware of the impact and importance of these effects and therefore I believe publication of this content is important . Strengths : - Padding is omni-present in modern CNN architectures and its effect is not often analyzed . This submission contains a thorough analysis , points out the problem with 0-padding and shows how various alternatives show significant improvement . - Especially the analysis of the asymmetric padding that leads to asymmetric filters in Section 5 is very interesting . - The text is well written and easy to follow . Weaknesses : - The introduction describes how the issue with the 0-padding leads to drastic differences in object detection between frames in a video . There has been work [ 39 ] which also showed that aliasing in CNNs causes these effects which does not seem to be discussed in this manuscript . What would happen to the effects of the 0-padding if an anti-aliased network would be used ? - The experiments are focused on traffic lights . Given the generality of the issue presented in the manuscript I feel that additional experiments with other small objects or related problems could have been included . Explanation of Rating : This submission describes a problem with 0-padding that significantly impacts an important problem and shows how to mitigate the situation . Therefore I recommend accepting this submission . Minor Comment : Page 5 : layer in RseNet - > ResNet", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "reply_text": "We thank our reviewer for encouraging us to study the relation between aliasing and padding effects . We compared CNN internals between baseline ResNet / VGG models and their antialiased counterparts [ made available by Zhang et al ] ( https : //github.com/adobe/antialiased-cnns ) . Our observations are ( see supplementary/rebuttal/antialiased_cnns for backing material ) : * While the feature maps inevitably develop spatial artifacts under zero padding , we found that * * antialiasing generally smoothens these artifacts , in particular , line artifacts became less prominent * * . * * * Interestingly , the asymmetry of certain average filters in ResNet and MobileNet models is reduced in the antialiased versions * * . This asymmetry is rooted in the uneven application of 0-padding during downsampling , induced by training the models on 224x224 images . Antialiasing seems increasingly able to mitigate this effect at deeper layers , where the asymmetry practically vanishes in all six models we analyzed . * * This is in line with the shift-consistency maps by Zhang ( ICLR 2019 ) * * that demonstrate how antialiased models remain shift robust at deeper layers unlike the baseline models . * * We think this ability is explainable by how BlurPool smoothens sharp edges * * during downsampling , in turn , reducing the overrepresentation of left and top zero edges in the presence of uneven padding - we will point to the need to examine these effects in future work . * Intrigued by the previous point , * * we quantified the shift consistency of ImageNet models we trained on 225x225 images * * using the metric proposed by Zhang ( ICLR 2019 ) . * * The consistency did improve for all of these models * * , compared with the baseline ones trained on 224x224 images . This suggests that the asymmetry in the filters makes the model less shift-robust and can be , in part , the underlying mechanism which the model uses to implicitly encode / overfit spatial information . We will expand the discussion section to report the above initial insights and to invite further analysis of the synergies between padding and aliasing effects in CNNs . We selected traffic-light detection mainly to demonstrate how spatial artifacts look like and to qualitatively illustrate how they can mute small object detection . We included a collection of examples of these artifacts in multiple domains ( see supplementary/further_CNN_examples ) and demonstrated a similar interference in the face detection example . We added one more example to that collection to showcase the impact of padding artifacts in image inpainting and to demonstrate significant qualitative improvement after training under mirror padding . To analyze the effects of unevenly-applied padding , we opted for ImageNet classification with ResNet / MobileNet models for the following reasons : * Standard * * ResNet / MobileNet models do perform zero padding at downsampling layers * * , the culprit of potential asymmetry , and widely used as `` trunk '' models in practice , making the analysis potentially relevant to a broad audience . * The standard * * training size * * is * fixed * to 224x224 which * * gives rise to unevenly-applied 0-padding at * every * downsampling layer * * of these models . Mitigating it only requires increasing the size to 225x225 , hence avoiding excessive padding that would dilute the effect we are after . In contrast , RCNN-based detectors are trained on COCO using * variable * input size to leverage the full resolution of the training data . This dilutes the effect we are after because 1 ) the chance to unevenly apply 0-padding is statistically reduced by 50 % , and 2 ) rectifying arbitrary input sizes to warrant even application of padding at all layers can require excessive input padding . * Both * * the nature of a classification task and the image statistics of ImagNet arguably encourage the emergence of symmetric mean filters * * . This might not be the case in Chinese character classification , where vertical strokes dominate the training data , or in drivable-area detection , where roads dominate certain parts of traffic scenes . * ImagNet classification serves as * * a versatile testbed * * that makes it easy to demonstrate the effects we measure and to compare them with other effects ( e.g.aliasing ) . The nuances of more involved computer-vision tasks ( e.g.inpainting masks ) make it a bit harder to isolate these effects . We nevertheless hinted about the need `` to closely examine the implications of spatial bias and foveation in various applications '' , perhaps in dedicated studies within ML sub-communities , and tried to focus on generic learning-representation aspects and their practical implications ."}, "3": {"review_id": "m1CD7tPubNy-3", "review_text": "Summary : This paper does empirical analysis on an object detector , esp . how it fails due to slight shift of objects in videos . By using different padding schemes for conv filters , the authors find the padding scheme is the root for such failures . Update after rebuttal : The author responses and manuscript revisions have addressed most of my concerns . Now I lean towards acceptance . Reasons for score : 1 . This paper is not written professionally . The introduction is very short . The following sections are more like experimental notes than a technical paper . 2.The analysis is mostly based on a single use case , i.e.an SSD object detector for traffic lights . This study is highly insufficient . More use cases and application scenarios should be investigated . 3.Experimental evaluation is also highly insufficient . Only changing the input image size by 1 pixel does n't reveal much . A lot of ablation studies and changing of padding schemes should be evaluated , preferably on a few datasets of different tasks ( classification , detection , segmentation , etc . ) . Other comments : I agree that padding could lead to biases when doing downsampling using stride > 1 , as illustrated in Fig.6.However , this seems to be easily fixed by doing random image flipping as one of the data augmentations ? It would even this bias . So this issue may not be practically severe , although it is worth study per se . Minor issues : The PDF file of this paper seems to have issues . The printed characters are blurry , and acrobat reports errors when open it . But some other PDF readers can open it .", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We thank our reviewer for proposing further ablation studies . Indeed , we repeated the ImageNet experiments on two of the ResNet models , this time by expanding the input dimensions by 2 pixels ( using mean padding ) , from 224x224 to 226x226 . The improvement in top-1 ( and top-5 ) accuracy matched the one we observed when expanding the input by 1 pixel only ( from 224x224 to 225x225 ) : |Input Size|ResNet-18|ResNet-34| |||| 224 \u00d7 224|69.93 % ( 89.22 % ) | 73.30 % ( 91.42 % ) | |225 \u00d7 225|70.27 % ( 89.52 % ) |73.72 % ( 91.58 % ) | |226 \u00d7 226|70.07 % ( 89.52 % ) |73.59 % ( 91.57 % ) | |256 \u00d7 256|70.24 % ( 89.52 % ) | N/A| * * This supports our claim that the boost is probably due to eliminating uneven application of padding and not merely due to the increase in input size * * . To further verify this observation , we expanded the input dimensions from 224x224 to 256x256 by applying 16-pixel mean padding around the input images . Training ResNet-18 on these images did not give any advantage over 225x225 inputs . > changing of padding schemes should be evaluated We did experiment with changing the padding method in ResNet-18 from zero to circular padding and training both on 224x224 images and on 225x225 images . In both cases , the accuracy improved visibly under circular padding : |Padding Method|Training on 224x224 images| Training on 225x225 images| |||| |Zero Padding|69.93 % ( 89.22 % ) |70.27 % ( 89.52 % ) | |Circular Padding|70.28 % ( 89.44 % ) |70.47 % ( 89.80 % ) | This is expected since circular padding significantly reduces feature-map artifacts that emerge under zero padding due to injecting zeros in the padding areas , as we explained in Section-7 and elaborated in Appendix D. Furthermore , training under circular padding also mitigates the asymmetry in mean filters , even when training on 224x224 images ( see Appendix C ) . This is because even when the padding is applied only at the left and top borders , padding by reusing the feature-map values prevents the disproportional presence of zeros at these borders , compared with the right and bottom borders . We included a similar analysis under mirror padding in the SSD example ( Section 7 ) . * * Our purpose is not to establish the superiority of a specific padding method * * , we did argue that the choice is problem dependent ( Section 8 ) . For example circular padding does not interfere much with ImageNet classification , since the objects tend to be mostly in the center . On the other hand , it might be less suited in small-object detection as it makes neighbors out of distant pixels ( hence our choice of mirror padding in the SSD experiment ) . * * Instead , we wanted to raise awareness about potentially harmful effects of padding in CNNs ( with a broader ML audience in mind ) , to exemplify how these could be mitigated , and to aid domain experts with a `` checklist '' of aspects to pay attention to when applying padding * * . > preferably on a few datasets of different tasks ( classification , detection , segmentation , etc . ) . In our response to AnonReviewer2 , we elaborated on the rationale behind choosing ImageNet classification and traffic-light detection to showcase our analysis and findings . > The analysis is mostly based on a single use case [ ... ] More use cases and application scenarios should be investigated . We did include a collection of examples demonstrating CNN spatial bias in multiple domains , including semantic segmentation , image colorization and inpainting , reinforcement learning , and spectrogram-based audio classification ( see supplementary/further_CNN_examples ) . > The introduction is very short . The following sections are more like experimental notes than a technical paper . We renamed the first section to \u201c Motivation \u201d to better reflect its content . Since our contribution revolves around edge cases and subtle effects in CNNs , we opted to first illustrate these cases and effects ( Sect.2-3 ) , then highlight why padding is important despite being the root cause ( Sect.4 ) , and finally demonstrate how applying padding carefully can mitigate these effects ( Sect.5-7 ) based on theoretical analysis , together with empirical results . > this seems to be easily fixed by doing random image flipping as one of the data augmentations ? Random horizontal flipping is indeed part of the ImageNet training recipe in PyTorch , which we used in our experiments . However , it does not fix the issue since the uneven application of padding ( and the bias it incurs ) takes place , more importantly , `` inside the CNN '' around the feature maps that are fed into downsampling layers . Randomly flipping feature maps is very likely to impede the learning - a dedicated study is needed to evaluate this issue . ( Note that both vertical and horizontal flipping would be needed to even out the bias ) . Finally , we thank our reviewer for reporting issues with viewing the manuscript . We will update the draft as explained above and make sure it can be viewed properly in different PDF viewers ."}}
