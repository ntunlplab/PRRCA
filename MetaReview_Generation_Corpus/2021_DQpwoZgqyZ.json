We will explain below regarding the concerns : Falsification and depth in examples : in this paper , we do not aim to provide state-of-the-art solutions to each of the problems in Section 3-7 . This paper aims to use empirical study to show the potential use of model information as a widely-applicable tool , and verify that model information can lead to new insights or new attacks in deep learning problems . Therefore , we did not go into great length into the theoretical details of each method or thorough comparison with existing approaches . To show that model information is fairly universal , we focus on the width of applications by experimenting with different problems in multiple areas . We believe there is much potential for future work that addresses each of these problems more rigorously . That said , there is indeed some lack of explanation and inconsistencies in the theoretical details of this paper . We have improved some details in the revision . For example , we add more discussion about the definition of model information L ( M , D ) in Section 2 , and we change to use better notations in the definition of similarity in Section 4 and Appendix A.3 . ResNet architecture : The ResNet architecture we use is from [ 1 ] , an improved version of the original ResNet [ 2 ] . In [ 1 ] , there is a convolutional layer on the residue path whenever the input and output dimensions of the residue block are not the same ( [ 3 ] ) . Similarly , in [ 2 ] there is a linear layer on the residue path ( Equation 2 of [ 2 ] ) . Therefore , Figure 7.a represents a general picture of where the parameters are in a typical ResNet model . Parameter ablation : we do not intend to propose a better ablation method , but an alternative ablation method that components conventional ablation . It can provide different insight about the contribution of model components , and can be used when conventional ablation is inapplicable . Justification of resetting parameters : resetting parameters to their random-initialized value removes the learned information about the task in the parameters . One could also set parameters to zero to remove information , but the resulting network will be difficult to optimize . Reciprocity of $ L ( M_A , B ) $ : theoretically speaking , if model $ M_A $ contain all information about dataset $ A $ , i.e. , $ K ( A|M_A ) =0 $ , and $ M_B $ contains all information about dataset $ B $ , then based on our definition ( we elaborated in the revised paper , see Section 2 ) , $ L ( M_A , B ) = K ( B ) -K ( B|M_A ) = K ( B ) -K ( B|A ) =K ( A ) -K ( A|B ) = K ( A ) -K ( A|M_B ) = L ( M_B , A ) $ , where K is Kolmogorov complexity and $ K ( A , B ) = K ( B ) +K ( A|B ) = K ( A ) +K ( B|A ) $ . In practice , because $ L $ is estimated with prequential coding , it is very likely that $ L ( M_A , B ) \\ne L ( M_B , A ) $ . As in this paper we focus on empirical results , we assume $ L ( M_A , B ) $ and $ L ( M_B , A ) $ do not differ by much and we report results using $ L ( M_A , B ) $ .

In particular , it illustrates how model information may be used to capture the difficulty of a task , the degree of similarity between domains , the capacity of a model The idea of using a quantity related to codelength to assess properties of a learning model is interesting ; indeed quantifying the properties chosen by the authors ( task complexity , domain similarity ) would be certainly useful . However , I am dubious whether the assessment using model information would be reliable . To my understanding model information evaluates the amount of information a trained model M_D contains about dataset D as a difference in codelength of the data and codelenghth of model+data ( as explained in Section 2 ) . Critically , it seems to me that this quantity depends both on the data AND the model . It is therefore a particular measure for a specific model ( or at most a family of models ) and a dataset . ( Incidentally , although guessable , it would be proper to define all the symbols in the equations ) . In Section 3 , it is not clear to me how this measure may be used to evaluate , for instance , the difficulty of a task : how is M_D chosen ? Is there an underlying claim that this measure would be independent from the choice of model ? What is the sensitivity of information measure to the choice of the model ? I am also perplexed by the results of the simulations : it seems that dropping samples or scrambling labels makes the task easier ; this , though , is quite counterintuitive as it would suggest that to simplify the problem we could literally drop samples or scramble labels ( I guess , but I may be wrong , that this outcome is due to the fact that `` difficulty '' is not evaluated in terms of generalization ) . Similarly , in Section 4 , it seems to me that a discussion on M_A and M_B is lacking . It is stated that a property of informational similarity is its independence from particular representations/modelling . This seems to me not to hold for model information where we have to rely on M_A and M_B . In Section 5 , how is a given task T defined ? This particularly important as it defines the set over which the maximization is computed and with respect to which capacity is defined . My intuition is that computing this quantity on a small set of tasks would return at best a lower bound . I have some doubts also in Section 7 , on Equation ( 8 ) . It would seem to that the model information of the student should be relative to a different dataset , one enriched with the output probabilities generated by the teacher . Why is it not ?", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "Thanks for your comments ! Dependency on dataset and model is a practical limitation of our proposed metrics , which we will explain below . Model information depends both on the data AND the model : in our definition , model information $ L $ is a function of both the dataset and the model . One might argue that in the absence of theoretical bounds , $ L $ is less comparable when both the dataset and the model is different . However , in most cases we are concerned with only one variable , either the dataset or the model . In most experiments of this paper , when comparing codelength values , we only change one of the parameters within task , data , model , and algorithm . ( An exception is Section 5 , when studying capacity , we let both model and dataset change.But models are within a family of ResNet-11 , and datasets are also different subsets of the same Tiny-ImageNet dataset . ) And results show that , when allowing only one parameter to vary at a time , model information does behave intuitively . We add discussion on the dependency of the proposed metrics on data and model in Section 8 . We also discussed how one can use model information to perform useful analysis despite these inevitable dependencies . Difficulty : similar to the above question , although theoretically we can define difficulty by $ K ( f ) $ , empirically when estimating $ K ( f ) $ using $ L ( M_D , D ) $ , dependency on model architecture becomes inevitable . To compare the difficulty of tasks one would need to use a fixed model architecture . For any reasonable choice of the model , the trend of model information on different tasks should be similar . Here different model architecture represents different prior information $ p $ , and difficulty is measured relative to this prior information ( i.e. , $ K ( f|p ) $ ) . In Figure 3 , missing objects and massart noise do not change L by much , the fluctuations we believe is due to the variation of the prequential codelength . Domain similarity : here $ M_A $ and $ M_B $ need to be the same model architecture . In theory , similarity can be defined without referring to specific modeling , but empirically we can only use methods such as prequential coding to approximate the information quantities . Therefore the result would depend on how models are chosen and trained , but as long as these are fixed , we can make comparisons between different datasets . Capacity : to evaluate the capacity of a model , the task T should be complex enough to saturate the information capacity of the model ( i.e. , when further increasing the complexity of the task , L no longer increases ) . Equation 8 in distillation : by $ L ( M_ { D+D_ { T } } , D ) $ , we measure the student model \u2019 s information about dataset $ D $ . By $ L ( M_ { D+D_ { T } } , D+D_T ) $ , we can measure the model \u2019 s information about both the dataset $ D $ and the output of the teacher model . The information transferred from the teacher to the student is partially about the dataset and partially about the teacher . In this section we mainly focused on the former , to show that distillation increased the student model \u2019 s knowledge about the dataset . When the latter is of concern , we can use $ L ( M_ { D+D_ { T } } , D+D_T ) $ to calculate ."}, {"review_id": "DQpwoZgqyZ-2", "review_text": "The central concept of this paper is model information , a description length of a discriminative model .

These are very valuable suggestions that help us clarify important details in the paper . Definition of model information : the definition of model information in the original paper is indeed not rooted in a concrete theoretical quantity , and may create confusion with notions like mutual information . Upon communication with [ 1 ] , we realize that model information corresponds to the Kolmogorov complexity of the model , i.e. $ L ( M , D ) \\approx K ( D ) -K ( D|M ) =K ( M ) -K ( M|D ) $ . With this definition , we can say that $ L $ calculated with prequential coding is an approximation of Kolmogorov complexity . We have added elaboration on the definition of model information in Section 2 . Difference of using codelength in [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] : codelength in [ 1 ] calculates generalizable model information $ K ( M ) -K ( M|D ) $ , while codelength in [ 2 ] calculates total model information $ K ( M ) $ ( including remembered noise on the training set ) . In task difficulty , increasing the number of examples with noisy labels will indeed lead to higher $ K ( M ) $ , but generalizable information $ K ( M ) -K ( M|D ) $ will not increase . We think defining difficulty by generalizable model information in [ 1 ] is a more reasonable choice . We have also added emphasize on `` generalizable information '' in the paper . In ( 2 ) , the k examples used for coding is not from the training set . This is consistent with [ 1 ] . Dependence of task difficulty on model architecture and training algorithm : theoretically , we can define the difficulty of a task by the Kolmogorov complexity K ( f ) of its input-output function Y=f ( X ) . Because we rely on prequential coding/model information to estimate this quantity , dependency on model architecture and training algorithm seems inevitable at this point and is a limitation of our method . However , if one is only concerned with comparing the difficulty among a group of tasks , one can fix the model architecture and the training algorithm , as we did in this paper , and the results will be comparable . We also include discussion on the dependency of the proposed metrics on model architecture and training algorithm in Section 8 . We also discussed how one can use model information to perform useful analysis despite these inevitable dependencies . Relationship between task difficulty and the number of examples n : if we regard the input-output relationship of a task as a distribution $ Q $ over the hypothesis space $ H $ , then the larger the number of examples in a task , the sharper $ Q $ becomes , and $ K ( Q ) $ will also be larger . For small-data regime , basically it will be hard to distinguish between difficult tasks , but easy tasks will have a small $ K ( Q ) $ even for small n and can be distinguished from more difficult tasks . The definition of domain similarity : thanks for pointing out the inconsistency of notations in the definition of similarity in the original submission , which we corrected in this version . We also add equivalent representation with Kolmogorov complexity . In Equation ( 4 ) , we use $ L ( M_A , B ) $ as the common information in A and B . $ L ( M_A , A ) + L ( M_B , B ) - L ( M_A , B ) $ is the sum of information in A and B , minus their common information , which is the information needed to describe A and B together . These can be seen from the connection between $ L ( M , D ) $ and $ K ( f ) $ . Symmetry of $ S ( A , B ) $ and $ L ( M_A , B ) $ : theoretically speaking , if model $ M_A $ contain all information about dataset $ A $ , i.e. , $ K ( A|M_A ) =0 $ , and $ M_B $ contains all information about dataset $ B $ , then based on our definition , $ L ( M_A , B ) = K ( B ) -K ( B|M_A ) = K ( B ) -K ( B|A ) =K ( A ) -K ( A|B ) = K ( A ) -K ( A|M_B ) = L ( M_B , A ) $ , where K is Kolmogorov complexity and $ K ( A , B ) = K ( B ) +K ( A|B ) = K ( A ) +K ( B|A ) $ . In practice , because $ L $ is estimated with prequential coding , it is very likely that $ L ( M_A , B ) \\ne L ( M_B , A ) $ . As in this paper we focus on empirical results , we assume $ L ( M_A , B ) $ and $ L ( M_B , A ) $ do not differ by much and we report results using $ L ( M_A , B ) $ . So theoretically $ S ( A , B ) $ is symmetric , while empirically it is usually not . We have added discussion on the symmetric property of $ S ( A , B ) $ in Appendix A.3 The subset claim : $ S^ { uni } ( A , B ) < 1 $ and $ S^ { uni } ( B , A ) =1 $ means $ L ( M_A , B ) < L ( M_B , B ) $ and $ L ( M_B , A ) = L ( M_A , A ) $ , which in turn means $ K ( B|A ) > 0 $ and $ K ( A|B ) =0 $ under the same condition as in the above point . This states that once we know B , we also know A , but only knowing A does not completely know B . This happens when A is a subset of B ."}, {"review_id": "DQpwoZgqyZ-3", "review_text": "The authors propose a statistic from information theory as a tool to analyze several aspects in machine learning : data , model , etc . use the codelength of a dataset subtracting the cross-entropy of the final model . The results are interesting , but slightly fall short of novelty , and do not lead to any significant implication/improvement to the existing machine learning pipeline/model . Clarity & Originality & Significance : Below I will take Section 3 as a specific example to elaborate . In Section 3 , the authors try to use L ( M_D , D ) to `` define '' task complexity , and argues that noise and task complexity are two independent directions . It seems what the authors try to define , is simply the mutual information between X and Y , where { x_i , y_i } is drawn from the joint distribution of ( X , Y ) . The quantity L ( M_D , D ) is an approximation ( lower bound ) of the mutual information . This is a commonly known fact , which makes the results fall short of novelty . When the authors define the approximation as the task complexity , it becomes dependent on both model and the dataset , not task alone . Therefore , L ( M_D , D ) will be strongly dependent on how one trains the model , and the size of dataset . For example , with/without dropout , L ( M_D , D ) will differ significantly . As a result , it is difficult to get useful take-away from the results of Section 3 , such as Figure 3 . In addition , it is unclear what the implications would be if we have an approximation of mutual information between X and Y . Could we use it to improve the learning of the task ? In authors ' response , I hope the authors can clarify the dependence of their metric on model , dataset , besides the task . Also , please clarify how it relates to mutual information , whether there is any related work that studies the approximation of mutual information between X and Y , and their relationship with the current work . Also , it would be interesting to know if there are any potential application for the proposed descriptive statistic on task complexity .", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "Thanks for your comments ! Please let us provide some clarification and explanation on the issues : Novelty and relationship with mutual information : model information is fundamentally different from mutual information between ( X , Y ) , because mutual information is measured in the space of distributions over $ X\\times Y $ , while ideally model information is measured with Kolmogorov complexity K in the hypothesis space H. Therefore they are independent quantities . Here is an example to illustrate : assume X is a random variable with high entropy , Y=f ( X ) and f is the identity function . The mutual information I ( X ; Y ) =H ( X ) would also be high . However , the identity function f is a very simple function in the hypothesis space H , with a very small K ( f ) . Model information measures something similar to K ( f ) with prequential coding , which tells how complex the function f is . A task with larger K ( f ) has more complex input-output relationships and is generally more difficult to learn . A task with a simple hypothesis like Y=X will generally be very easy to learn by a neural network . This is the reason we propose to define difficulty with model information . This similarly applies to other sections of the paper , for example , in Section 4 we also define quantities using Kolmogorov complexity and use model information as an approximation . To state more clearly the quantities we are studying and to help readers avoid possible confusion with mutual information , we elaborated on the definition of model information and its connection to Kolmogorov complexity in Section 2 . Dependence of difficulty metric on model and dataset : in our definition , model information L is a function of both the dataset and the model . To approximate Kolmogorov complexity with prequential coding , using a specific model and dataset is inevitable in the coding process . Here using different model architecture means different prior information is introduced , and L would be different . However , for any reasonable choice of the model , the trend of model information on different tasks should be similar . To compare the difficulty of tasks by the value of L , the model will need to be fixed . Therefore task difficulty in Section 3 is measured with respect to a specific model family . The size of the dataset also affects the value of L , so it also needs to be fixed when making comparisons . We added in Section 8 a discussion around dependency on model and dataset and its implications . We also showed how one can use model information to perform useful analysis despite these inevitable dependencies . Application of task complexity : one potential use case is providing a guideline for controlling difficulty when designing tasks . Another is helping to interpret performance metrics : achieving 0.9 accuracy on a difficult task is much more significant than achieving the same accuracy on an easy task . Knowing the difficulty of tasks can also help to improve model performance , for example , in curriculum learning one can use difficulty to arrange tasks from easy to difficult to help optimization ( e.g. [ 1 ] ) .

To my understanding model information evaluates the amount of information a trained model M_D contains about dataset D as a difference in codelength of the data and codelenghth of model+data ( as explained in Section 2 ) . Critically , it seems to me that this quantity depends both on the data AND the model . It is therefore a particular measure for a specific model ( or at most a family of models ) and a dataset . ( Incidentally , although guessable , it would be proper to define all the symbols in the equations ) . In Section 3 , it is not clear to me how this measure may be used to evaluate , for instance , the difficulty of a task : how is M_D chosen ? Is there an underlying claim that this measure would be independent from the choice of model ? What is the sensitivity of information measure to the choice of the model ? I am also perplexed by the results of the simulations : it seems that dropping samples or scrambling labels makes the task easier ; this , though , is quite counterintuitive as it would suggest that to simplify the problem we could literally drop samples or scramble labels ( I guess , but I may be wrong , that this outcome is due to the fact that `` difficulty '' is not evaluated in terms of generalization ) . Similarly , in Section 4 , it seems to me that a discussion on M_A and M_B is lacking . It is stated that a property of informational similarity is its independence from particular representations/modelling . This seems to me not to hold for model information where we have to rely on M_A and M_B . In Section 5 , how is a given task T defined ? This particularly important as it defines the set over which the maximization is computed and with respect to which capacity is defined . My intuition is that computing this quantity on a small set of tasks would return at best a lower bound . I have some doubts also in Section 7 , on Equation ( 8 ) . It would seem to that the model information of the student should be relative to a different dataset , one enriched with the output probabilities generated by the teacher . Why is it not ?", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "Thanks for your comments ! Dependency on dataset and model is a practical limitation of our proposed metrics , which we will explain below . Model information depends both on the data AND the model : in our definition , model information $ L $ is a function of both the dataset and the model . One might argue that in the absence of theoretical bounds , $ L $ is less comparable when both the dataset and the model is different . However , in most cases we are concerned with only one variable , either the dataset or the model . In most experiments of this paper , when comparing codelength values , we only change one of the parameters within task , data , model , and algorithm . ( An exception is Section 5 , when studying capacity , we let both model and dataset change.But models are within a family of ResNet-11 , and datasets are also different subsets of the same Tiny-ImageNet dataset . ) And results show that , when allowing only one parameter to vary at a time , model information does behave intuitively . We add discussion on the dependency of the proposed metrics on data and model in Section 8 . We also discussed how one can use model information to perform useful analysis despite these inevitable dependencies . Difficulty : similar to the above question , although theoretically we can define difficulty by $ K ( f ) $ , empirically when estimating $ K ( f ) $ using $ L ( M_D , D ) $ , dependency on model architecture becomes inevitable . To compare the difficulty of tasks one would need to use a fixed model architecture . For any reasonable choice of the model , the trend of model information on different tasks should be similar . Here different model architecture represents different prior information $ p $ , and difficulty is measured relative to this prior information ( i.e. , $ K ( f|p ) $ ) . In Figure 3 , missing objects and massart noise do not change L by much , the fluctuations we believe is due to the variation of the prequential codelength . Domain similarity : here $ M_A $ and $ M_B $ need to be the same model architecture . In theory , similarity can be defined without referring to specific modeling , but empirically we can only use methods such as prequential coding to approximate the information quantities . Therefore the result would depend on how models are chosen and trained , but as long as these are fixed , we can make comparisons between different datasets . Capacity : to evaluate the capacity of a model , the task T should be complex enough to saturate the information capacity of the model ( i.e. , when further increasing the complexity of the task , L no longer increases ) . Equation 8 in distillation : by $ L ( M_ { D+D_ { T } } , D ) $ , we measure the student model \u2019 s information about dataset $ D $ . By $ L ( M_ { D+D_ { T } } , D+D_T ) $ , we can measure the model \u2019 s information about both the dataset $ D $ and the output of the teacher model . The information transferred from the teacher to the student is partially about the dataset and partially about the teacher . In this section we mainly focused on the former , to show that distillation increased the student model \u2019 s knowledge about the dataset . When the latter is of concern , we can use $ L ( M_ { D+D_ { T } } , D+D_T ) $ to calculate ."}, "2": {"review_id": "DQpwoZgqyZ-2", "review_text": "The central concept of this paper is model information , a description length of a discriminative model . The authors advocate usage of model information for analyzing several aspects in deep learning .

I suggest to clarify early that by model information it is meant some kind of description length of the discriminative model $ p_\\theta ( Y \\mid X ) $ . - As model information is not a well-defined concept , it is not appropriate to say `` an approximation of model information '' . Better to say `` an instance/a variant/a definition of model information '' . - As all experiments are done using the instance of model information defined by Zhang et al . [ 1 ] ( called Information Transfer ) , the conclusions may not hold for other instances of model information . For example , if one defines model information with the prequential coding of Bleir and Ollivier [ 2 ] , then increasing the number of examples with noisy labels will make the task more difficult . - Please clarify whether the $ k $ examples in equation ( 2 ) are from the training set $ D $ for not . * * Task difficulty * * I really like using model information for assessing task difficulty . The only concern is that the task difficulty depends on the network and the training algorithm . Additionally , I suggest to plot task difficulty versus the number of training examples . Will we see that it plateaus after enough number of training examples are given ? How would task difficulty behave in the small data regime ? * * Domain similarity * * - What do union and intersection signs mean for datasets in equation ( 4 ) ?

These are very valuable suggestions that help us clarify important details in the paper . Definition of model information : the definition of model information in the original paper is indeed not rooted in a concrete theoretical quantity , and may create confusion with notions like mutual information . Upon communication with [ 1 ] , we realize that model information corresponds to the Kolmogorov complexity of the model , i.e. $ L ( M , D ) \\approx K ( D ) -K ( D|M ) =K ( M ) -K ( M|D ) $ . With this definition , we can say that $ L $ calculated with prequential coding is an approximation of Kolmogorov complexity . We have added elaboration on the definition of model information in Section 2 . Difference of using codelength in [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] : codelength in [ 1 ] calculates generalizable model information $ K ( M ) -K ( M|D ) $ , while codelength in [ 2 ] calculates total model information $ K ( M ) $ ( including remembered noise on the training set ) . In task difficulty , increasing the number of examples with noisy labels will indeed lead to higher $ K ( M ) $ , but generalizable information $ K ( M ) -K ( M|D ) $ will not increase . We think defining difficulty by generalizable model information in [ 1 ] is a more reasonable choice . We have also added emphasize on `` generalizable information '' in the paper . In ( 2 ) , the k examples used for coding is not from the training set . This is consistent with [ 1 ] . Dependence of task difficulty on model architecture and training algorithm : theoretically , we can define the difficulty of a task by the Kolmogorov complexity K ( f ) of its input-output function Y=f ( X ) . Because we rely on prequential coding/model information to estimate this quantity , dependency on model architecture and training algorithm seems inevitable at this point and is a limitation of our method . However , if one is only concerned with comparing the difficulty among a group of tasks , one can fix the model architecture and the training algorithm , as we did in this paper , and the results will be comparable . We also include discussion on the dependency of the proposed metrics on model architecture and training algorithm in Section 8 . We also discussed how one can use model information to perform useful analysis despite these inevitable dependencies . Relationship between task difficulty and the number of examples n : if we regard the input-output relationship of a task as a distribution $ Q $ over the hypothesis space $ H $ , then the larger the number of examples in a task , the sharper $ Q $ becomes , and $ K ( Q ) $ will also be larger . For small-data regime , basically it will be hard to distinguish between difficult tasks , but easy tasks will have a small $ K ( Q ) $ even for small n and can be distinguished from more difficult tasks . The definition of domain similarity : thanks for pointing out the inconsistency of notations in the definition of similarity in the original submission , which we corrected in this version . We also add equivalent representation with Kolmogorov complexity . In Equation ( 4 ) , we use $ L ( M_A , B ) $ as the common information in A and B . $ L ( M_A , A ) + L ( M_B , B ) - L ( M_A , B ) $ is the sum of information in A and B , minus their common information , which is the information needed to describe A and B together . These can be seen from the connection between $ L ( M , D ) $ and $ K ( f ) $ . Symmetry of $ S ( A , B ) $ and $ L ( M_A , B ) $ : theoretically speaking , if model $ M_A $ contain all information about dataset $ A $ , i.e. , $ K ( A|M_A ) =0 $ , and $ M_B $ contains all information about dataset $ B $ , then based on our definition , $ L ( M_A , B ) = K ( B ) -K ( B|M_A ) = K ( B ) -K ( B|A ) =K ( A ) -K ( A|B ) = K ( A ) -K ( A|M_B ) = L ( M_B , A ) $ , where K is Kolmogorov complexity and $ K ( A , B ) = K ( B ) +K ( A|B ) = K ( A ) +K ( B|A ) $ . In practice , because $ L $ is estimated with prequential coding , it is very likely that $ L ( M_A , B ) \\ne L ( M_B , A ) $ . As in this paper we focus on empirical results , we assume $ L ( M_A , B ) $ and $ L ( M_B , A ) $ do not differ by much and we report results using $ L ( M_A , B ) $ . So theoretically $ S ( A , B ) $ is symmetric , while empirically it is usually not . We have added discussion on the symmetric property of $ S ( A , B ) $ in Appendix A.3 The subset claim : $ S^ { uni } ( A , B ) < 1 $ and $ S^ { uni } ( B , A ) =1 $ means $ L ( M_A , B ) < L ( M_B , B ) $ and $ L ( M_B , A ) = L ( M_A , A ) $ , which in turn means $ K ( B|A ) > 0 $ and $ K ( A|B ) =0 $ under the same condition as in the above point . This states that once we know B , we also know A , but only knowing A does not completely know B . This happens when A is a subset of B ."}, "3": {"review_id": "DQpwoZgqyZ-3", "review_text": "The authors propose a statistic from information theory as a tool to analyze several aspects in machine learning : data , model , etc . use the codelength of a dataset subtracting the cross-entropy of the final model . The results are interesting , but slightly fall short of novelty , and do not lead to any significant implication/improvement to the existing machine learning pipeline/model . Clarity & Originality & Significance : Below I will take Section 3 as a specific example to elaborate . In Section 3 , the authors try to use L ( M_D , D ) to `` define '' task complexity , and argues that noise and task complexity are two independent directions . It seems what the authors try to define , is simply the mutual information between X and Y , where { x_i , y_i } is drawn from the joint distribution of ( X , Y ) . The quantity L ( M_D , D ) is an approximation ( lower bound ) of the mutual information . This is a commonly known fact , which makes the results fall short of novelty . When the authors define the approximation as the task complexity , it becomes dependent on both model and the dataset , not task alone . Therefore , L ( M_D , D ) will be strongly dependent on how one trains the model , and the size of dataset . For example , with/without dropout , L ( M_D , D ) will differ significantly . As a result , it is difficult to get useful take-away from the results of Section 3 , such as Figure 3 . In addition , it is unclear what the implications would be if we have an approximation of mutual information between X and Y . Could we use it to improve the learning of the task ? In authors ' response , I hope the authors can clarify the dependence of their metric on model , dataset , besides the task . Also , please clarify how it relates to mutual information , whether there is any related work that studies the approximation of mutual information between X and Y , and their relationship with the current work . Also , it would be interesting to know if there are any potential application for the proposed descriptive statistic on task complexity .", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "Thanks for your comments ! Please let us provide some clarification and explanation on the issues : Novelty and relationship with mutual information : model information is fundamentally different from mutual information between ( X , Y ) , because mutual information is measured in the space of distributions over $ X\\times Y $ , while ideally model information is measured with Kolmogorov complexity K in the hypothesis space H. Therefore they are independent quantities . Here is an example to illustrate : assume X is a random variable with high entropy , Y=f ( X ) and f is the identity function . The mutual information I ( X ; Y ) =H ( X ) would also be high . However , the identity function f is a very simple function in the hypothesis space H , with a very small K ( f ) . Model information measures something similar to K ( f ) with prequential coding , which tells how complex the function f is . A task with larger K ( f ) has more complex input-output relationships and is generally more difficult to learn . A task with a simple hypothesis like Y=X will generally be very easy to learn by a neural network . This is the reason we propose to define difficulty with model information . This similarly applies to other sections of the paper , for example , in Section 4 we also define quantities using Kolmogorov complexity and use model information as an approximation . To state more clearly the quantities we are studying and to help readers avoid possible confusion with mutual information , we elaborated on the definition of model information and its connection to Kolmogorov complexity in Section 2 . Dependence of difficulty metric on model and dataset : in our definition , model information L is a function of both the dataset and the model . To approximate Kolmogorov complexity with prequential coding , using a specific model and dataset is inevitable in the coding process . Here using different model architecture means different prior information is introduced , and L would be different . However , for any reasonable choice of the model , the trend of model information on different tasks should be similar . To compare the difficulty of tasks by the value of L , the model will need to be fixed . Therefore task difficulty in Section 3 is measured with respect to a specific model family . The size of the dataset also affects the value of L , so it also needs to be fixed when making comparisons . We added in Section 8 a discussion around dependency on model and dataset and its implications . We also showed how one can use model information to perform useful analysis despite these inevitable dependencies . Application of task complexity : one potential use case is providing a guideline for controlling difficulty when designing tasks . Another is helping to interpret performance metrics : achieving 0.9 accuracy on a difficult task is much more significant than achieving the same accuracy on an easy task . Knowing the difficulty of tasks can also help to improve model performance , for example , in curriculum learning one can use difficulty to arrange tasks from easy to difficult to help optimization ( e.g. [ 1 ] ) .
