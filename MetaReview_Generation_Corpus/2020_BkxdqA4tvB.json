They propose a new variational inference algorithm for this model-learning problem that marginalizes all discrete random variables in the model using the forward-backward algorithm and, in so doing, converts the model to one with a differentiable density, so that the gradient of the variational objective can be estimated with the low-variance reparameterization estimator. The authors also point out an issue in choosing a variational objective; the standard ELBO objective is not suitable for their learning problem, because it leads to a model that does not use discrete random variables meaningfully. To overcome this issue, they suggest a new improved objective and a learning procedure, which encourage the learned model to use discrete variables for capturing different modes of dynamics. The proposed variational inference algorithm was applied to three datasets, and in all these cases, it showed promising results. I found the main idea and technique of the paper simple and nice.

As far as I understand, the paper claims two contributions: 1. A combination of collapsed variational inference and amortised inference for SNLDS, to make the training pipeline fully differentiable; 2. An improved loss function upon the variational lowerbound (ELBO) to force the model to use the discrete states. ======= novelty ======= The 1st idea is combinatorial: 1. The forward-backward algorithm is a standard inference method for HMM-like sequence models; collapsed variational inference has been investigated extensively in 2000s when hierarchical Bayes models were actively developed; amortised inference is widely used in variational auto-encoders. 2. The combination of the above two inference methods on S(N)LDS is new to the best of my knowledge. However, this combination has been proposed on a similar model called Kalman VAE ( Fraccaro et al. 2017), where the sequence model can be viewed as a \"soft\" version of SLDS. The 2nd idea is interesting but not very well explained to some extent: 1. The goal of the modified objective function is to encourage the model to use the discrete states (instead of pushing all useful information to the continuous states). It is interesting as it regularises the *exact posterior* of the discrete states conditioned on the *approximately inferred* continuous states. 2. I believe the entropy regulariser is non-differentiable as it is based on a *histogram* estimate of the temporally averaged discrete state distribution. How exactly is this regulariser implemented? 3. I agree adding the KL regulariser can avoid the iterating assignment pathology, however, is random assignment of the regime preferred in any case? From the introductory example, I think contiguous segments are preferred. ======= significance ======= Experiments consider 3 synthetic examples for sequence segmentation (so that ground truth is available). The proposed approach performs significantly better which is a good sign. The paper also provides useful analysis on the effects of balancing parameter tempering which is always welcome. However, two baselines are missing: 1. To claim the significance of the collapsed variational inference approach, a non-collapsed inference version of the proposed SNLDS model needs to be compared. The authors did discuss this and mentioned possible workarounds (e.g. using the Gumbel-softmax trick for discrete state inference), but the comparison is not reported. If compared, this will serve well as an ablation study for the inference method. 2. The paper also provides comparisons across models, but I do think the Kalman VAE model needs to be compared to SNLDS. Both models are more flexible than the original SLDS, but the complexity is added in different ways. Since I think the inference mechanisms are similar (both using forward-backward inference for top-level latents and amortised inference for bottom-level latents), this comparison would provide a better ablation study on the modelling side. ======= clarity ======= 1. The paper presentation is overall clear to me, although I found the many sentences in parenthesis a bit distracted, so I would suggest maybe using footnotes for them instead. 2. For readers who are less familiar with HMMs/forward-backward algorithms, the papers can be difficult to understand, as it skips all the detailed computation of the gamma terms. I would suggest adding the details in the appendix, and/or visualise the intuition using e.g. message passing on factor graphs. 3.

The data is modeled using a state space model where each state consists of a discrete and a continuous part. The discrete state denotes the segment the system is currently in and the continuous state which is conditioned on the discrete one denotes an uninterpretable feature vector. The transition distributions are non-linear. The observation at each time step is high-dimensional and produced by an emission distribution whose parameters are given by a neural network which takes in the continuous state. Learning and inference is done by maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO). Problems with the discreteness of latent variables is circumvented by marginalizing (collapsing) them out using the forward-backward algorithm. Problems with making discrete states meaningful when there are non-linear transitions/emissions is addressed by annealing. This annealing scheme forces the conditional distributions on the discrete state to have high entropy (be close to a uniform distribution) at the start by adding a term to the ELBO objective and the multiplier of this term is decreased as the training progresses. There are actually two terms to do this since one alone didn't work. STRUCTURE: The paper is well-written and easy to understand. NOVELTY: I found the technique of estimating gradients using forward-backward to be interesting and potentially useful in other domains when parts of generative models can be marginalized out using belief propagation. While the problem of unsupervised time-series segmentation is an important one, I'm not sure the proposed technique addresses it completely. The main thing that seems to be doing the work is not the marginalization using forward-backward, but rather the annealing scheme which itself seems ad-hoc and it is not clear whether this is generalizable to other domains or it just happened to work on the problems in the paper. It is not clear why maximizing the entropy of the variational transition should encourage meaningful clustering. Would this work even if the emission distribution is made much more powerful?

Also, no annealing was used in the baseline methods (like increasing K in SVAE or multi-step training).

As presented in the text , marginalization is critical for performance because it reduces variance of discrete optimization , and keeps sharp boundaries between segments . -- \u201c it is not clear whether this [ method ] is generalizable to other domains or it just happened to work on the problems in the paper. \u201d , \u201c I would consider bumping up my score if demonstrated to work on a real dataset \u201d : We are currently working on applying our model on data sets from \u201c real \u201d domains . In the meantime , we used synthetic data so we can quantitatively evaluate performance , as is common in the field . Please note that the 4 papers detailing the baseline models we compare to also mostly used synthetic data ( the 2 real datasets had no ground truth segments , so evaluation was subjective ) . -- \u201c It is not clear why maximizing the entropy of the variational transition should encourage meaningful clustering. \u201d , `` better understanding of the principles behind why this annealing scheme helps \u201d : Adding a term that encourages the posterior to stay close to uniform ( our L_CE term ) , and annealing it slowly , is a well-known method for encouraging all the discrete states to be equally `` well trained '' before the model starts partitioning the data into clusters . See eg Ueda'98 . This can be thought of as a continuous version of multi-stage training , which is used in most prior works on SVAE and SLDS . In our paper , we also suggested a second entropy regularizer , H ( O ) . However , in response to R3 , we checked our code , and found that we were not using this as part of the objective . We have thus removed this from the paper , simplifying our method . ( We checked the results are unchanged . ) Reference : N. Ueda and R.

We could use similar methods in our case , but we did not need to , since our emission model is simple . Reference : A. R. A. van den Oord Ben Poole Oriol Vinyals , \u201c Fixing Posterior Collapse with delta-VAEs , \u201d in ICLR , 2019 -- '' no annealing was used in the baseline methods ( like increasing K in SVAE or multi-step training ) . \u201d , \u201c proper tweaking of the competing algorithms ( similar to annealing ) is needed to compare the proposed method fairly. \u201c : We did proper tweaking of the competing algorithms in the original submission . We have expanded the description of regularization and multi-step training in the appendix ( see section A.6 ) . We performed multi-step training for SVAE . Although not described in detail in the SVAE paper , it is a part of their reference implementation on Github . We also performed multi-step training for rSLDS . For fair comparison , we also trained the new Gumbel Softmax and KVAE models with our annealing . Both methods segmented the bouncing ball well ( F1=0.98 and 1.0 respectively ) , but neither model segmented the reacher task well ( F1=0.05 and 0.21 respectively ) . See the new figure 3 ."}}
