Since we are interested in the change of the network function when training , Eq.13 corresponds to the functional update of the network . In other words , when training with BN and with a given optimization algorithm , the intrinsic update is in fact described in Eq.13.The question is then : what are the theoretical insights provided by these quantities ? The fact is that the optimization of deep neural networks is poorly understood . The loss landscape has a high dimension and is non convex . Comparing steps of different optimization methods at different points of the parameter space will not give any fruitful insights for a better understanding of the optimization process . However , we can find equivalent schemes that will yield the same network function update during training ( see Section 3 ) , which reveals an unexpected property of SGD with BN . We can also study empirically geometrical phenomena highlighted by the framework , which turns out to have a significant impact on training of CNNs with BN on complex images domains ( see Section 4 ) . In other words , the modification of effective quantities leads to new optimization schemes that have different impacts in terms of speed and generalization . # # # Equivalence theorem The purpose of this theorem is to show that in the presence of BN Layers , for the same model , standard SGD behaves like an adaptive method . This is not expected since SGD has no second-order moment in its update . Formally , we show the equivalence between SGD and the scheme dubbed AdamG * . AdamG * is an adaptive scheme relying on a second-order moment . Unlike Adam , which is adaptive w.r.t the second-order moment for each parameter , AdamG * is adaptive for each group of radially-invariant parameters ( i.e. , filters for CNNs with BN ) . This scheme is very close to AdamG from Cho & Lee 2017 , presented in the original paper as a variant of Adam . Hence the link between SGD and a variant of Adam . The full sentence of this contribution in the original submission was `` We show that , in presence of BN layers , SGD behaves like Adam without momentum , * adapted and constrained to the hypersphere . * '' . # # # Details on equivalence theorem - * \u2018 The technical definitions of the terms introduced in the work , like `` equivalence of order 2 '' , and the significance of the results , need to be stated in the main text \u2019 * . As stated in the paper just above the Theorem , we call \u00ab equivalent at order 2 in the step \u00bb a scheme equivalence that holds when we use for $ r_k $ an expression that satisfies the radius dynamic with a Taylor expansion at order 2 . This is the only assumption of the Theorem and it is verified in practice ( see Appendix C.1.5 and Figure 5 in the supplementary material ) . - _ \u2018 Why does the memory $ v\\_k $ in the AdamG * update increase over time ( with $ \\beta > 1 $ ) if $ \\eta \\lambda > 2 $ ? Or is it a setting not supported by Theorem 2 ? \u2019 _ . Considering a radius approximated at order 2 , the theorem holds for any positive values of $ \\lambda $ , $ \\eta $ and $ r_0 $ . It thus holds even if $ \\eta\\lambda > 2 $ ( and hence $ \\beta > 1 $ ) , although this setting is not particularly practical . For standard values of hyperparameters $ \\lambda < 1 $ ( order of magnitude of 1e-4 ) and $ \\eta < 1 $ ( order of magnitude at most 1e-1 ) , the higher-order terms of the radius in the Taylor expansion empirically become negligible and the equivalence stated in the theorem can be seen as a strong proxy to reality . Under such conditions , which are verified in practice , AdamG * is adapted by its order-two moments for each group of radially-invariant parameters . - * \u2018 What is the effect of L2 regularization if the complexity of the model is independent of the magnitude of the weight vector ? \u2019 * We are not sure what `` the complexity of the model '' refers to , but the overall effect of L2 regularization in presence of BN is to exponentially schedule the learning rate . In this study , we go one step further by resolving the radius dynamic and demonstrate it contributes to the factor $ \\beta < 1 $ of second-order moment of the gradient norm , making SGD equivalent to an adaptive method . - * \u2018 Why is $ \\beta=1 $ if there is no L2 regularization but $ \\beta < 1 $ if $ \\eta \\lambda < 2 $ ? ' * . Again , these are mathematical conditions to have the equivalence . The expression of beta actually reveals that the L2 regularization parameters control the memory of the past gradients norm , which is interesting . If $ \\beta=1 $ ( no L2 regularization ) , then there is no attenuation ( Adagrad-style ) ; each gradient norm has the same contribution in the order-two moments . The effect of L2 regularization is to have a decay factor ( $ \\beta < 1 $ ) on past gradient norm in the order-2 moment ."}, {"review_id": "jHykXSIk3ch-1", "review_text": "The paper attempts to analyze Adam with BN from a spherical perspective . 1.Though the authors derived the effective learning rate for Adam in Eq.13 , the analysis still needs to be more thorough .
