We experienced model collapse and training instability ( either the generator or discriminator overpower one another ) with GAN and LSGAN . We have updated the manuscript to include discussions on the choice of the objective function . - To generate the dichotomized Gaussian ( DG ) data , we first fitted the DG model with the mean and covariance of the inferred spike trains from the recorded calcium imaging signals . We sample the correlated spike trains from the DG model so that it matches the duration as the recorded data ( 899 seconds of recordings ) .
