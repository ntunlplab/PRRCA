The authors show that this enables training neural networks that are guaranteed to satisfy non-trivial constraints on the neurons in a manner that is significantly more scalable than prior work, and demonstrate this experimentally on a generative modelling task.\n\nThe problem considered in the paper is certainly significant (training neural networks that are guaranteed to satisfy constraints arises in many applications) and the authors make some interesting contributions. However, the reviewers found the following issues that make it difficult to accept the paper in its present form:\n1) The setting of homogeneous linear equality constraints is not well-motivated and the significance of being able to impose such constraints is not clearly articulated in the paper. The authors would do well to prepare a future revision documenting use-cases motivated by practical applications and add these to the paper.\n2) The experimental evaluation is not sufficiently thorough: the authors evaluate their method on an artificial constraint involving a \"checkerboard pattern\" on MNIST. Even in this case, the training method proposed by the authors seems to suffer from some issues, and more thorough experiments need to be conducted to confirm that the training method can perform well across a variety of datasets and constraints.\n\nGiven these issues, I recommend rejection. However, I encourage the authors to revise their work on this important topic and prepare a future version including practical examples of the constraints and experiments on a variety of prediction tasks.\n\n", "reviews": [{"review_id": "ByxXZpVtPB-0", "review_text": "The paper proposes a new faster algorithm to add inequality constraints to neural layers.
