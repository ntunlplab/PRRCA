To cope with that problem , authors learn visual and semantic prototypes which are then adopted to perform gradient descent over a graph in which the topological relationship among similar/dissimilar classes are preserved . In the experimental validation , the proposed method shows its superiority among a number of prior methods in zero-shot learning , including discriminative and generative methods . * Pros * * The computational pipeline is novel and very original with respect to prior work , which mainly focuses on feature generating mechanisms * Several state-of-the-art approaches are outperformed on 3 classical benchmark datasets for zero-shot learning ( AWA2 , CUB , aPY ) * Cons * * * * Sensitivity * * . The method is depending upon a number of hyper-parameters ( such as the threshold $ \\varepsilon $ for the visual/semantic neighbor graphs or the softmax temperature $ \\gamma $ ) . * * * About datasets * * . Although tiered-ImageNet is a popular benchmark in few-shot learning , there are methods which provide experimental results on the full ImageNet , such as [ Kampffmetyer et al. , Rethinking Knowledge Graph Propagation for Zero-Shot Learning , CVPR 2019 ] . It is not fully clear to which extent the proposed variants of tiered-ImageNet , adapted for zero-shot learning , would improve upon the existing ImageNet specs . * Minor Comments * The references ( Xian et al.2019a ) and ( Xian et al.2019b ) refer to the same paper . * Pre-Rebuttal Evaluation * I think the method is novel and original , and it is adopting a very original direction which is dissimilar for mainstream approaches in zero-shot learning . My only questions relate to the computational sensitivity of the proposed method , which needs some further experimental shreds of evidence . Also , the datasets selected by authors need some clarifications , in both why a new benchmark was introduced and why . It would be great to have more experimental pieces of evidence on other benchmark datasets which are usually considered in zero-shot learning ( such as the `` standard '' ImageNet or classical datasets such as SUN -- see ( Xian et al.2019a ) -- or FLO -- see ( Xian et al.2018 ) .If the two prior aspects will be addressed by the Authors , I would be more than happy to call for a full acceptance . * Post-Rebuttal Evaluation [ FINAL ] * I have thoroughly inspected the revised manuscript and read the response provided by authors . I was pleased in registering that my two requests were taken into consideration by authors who provided a solid sensitivity analysis and additional experimental evidences on ImageNet . Therefore , taking this into account , I am now convinced in raising my original score ( 5 : Marginally below acceptance threshold ) to a full acceptance ( 7 : Good paper , accept ) .", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "reply_text": "Thank you for reviewing our submission and the comprehensive comments ! We are very happy to answer the two aspects with regard to sensitivity and datasets ! * * Q1 * * : Sensitivity . The method is depending upon a number of hyper-parameters ( such as the threshold for the visual/semantic neighbor graphs or the softmax temperature ) . * * A1 * * : We have added one section and Figure 3 to show the effects of the selection for hyperparameters : threshold , temperature , N/K for N-way-K-shot task , propagation steps , etc . For the threshold , we found the performance is similar when the threshold is bigger than cosine ( 30 ) . This is because when the threshold is too small , it does not allow any edges to connect between classes and thus there is no propagation and will damage the performance . The accuracy float is within 2 % when the temperature is chosen between 1-20 . * * Q2 * * : About datasets .

Intuitively , this initialization is important since visual prototypes serve as half of the inputs to the model but we do n't have access to the images . In our revised version , we removed this claim from the experiment section but mentioned in Section 6 as future studies . * * Q5 * * : The method relies on a few hyper-parameters ( temperature , threshold , episode learning N , K , learning weight ( lambda ) , and the number of propagation steps ) , these are not studied , but for eg the propagation steps it is claimed that more steps perform better . This should be studied . * * A5 * * : Thanks for this valuable suggestion . We have added Section 6 and Figure 3 to show the sensitivity of these hyperparameters to the performance on AWA2 , including the result when using a different number of propagation steps . For example , the temperature is not sensitive to accuracy . The threshold needs to be bigger than cosine ( 30 ) .

Figure 1 just shows the embedding of the prototypes .

To cope with that problem , authors learn visual and semantic prototypes which are then adopted to perform gradient descent over a graph in which the topological relationship among similar/dissimilar classes are preserved . In the experimental validation , the proposed method shows its superiority among a number of prior methods in zero-shot learning , including discriminative and generative methods . * Pros * * The computational pipeline is novel and very original with respect to prior work , which mainly focuses on feature generating mechanisms * Several state-of-the-art approaches are outperformed on 3 classical benchmark datasets for zero-shot learning ( AWA2 , CUB , aPY ) * Cons * * * * Sensitivity * * . The method is depending upon a number of hyper-parameters ( such as the threshold $ \\varepsilon $ for the visual/semantic neighbor graphs or the softmax temperature $ \\gamma $ ) . * * * About datasets * * . Although tiered-ImageNet is a popular benchmark in few-shot learning , there are methods which provide experimental results on the full ImageNet , such as [ Kampffmetyer et al. , Rethinking Knowledge Graph Propagation for Zero-Shot Learning , CVPR 2019 ] . It is not fully clear to which extent the proposed variants of tiered-ImageNet , adapted for zero-shot learning , would improve upon the existing ImageNet specs . * Minor Comments * The references ( Xian et al.2019a ) and ( Xian et al.2019b ) refer to the same paper . * Pre-Rebuttal Evaluation * I think the method is novel and original , and it is adopting a very original direction which is dissimilar for mainstream approaches in zero-shot learning . My only questions relate to the computational sensitivity of the proposed method , which needs some further experimental shreds of evidence . Also , the datasets selected by authors need some clarifications , in both why a new benchmark was introduced and why . It would be great to have more experimental pieces of evidence on other benchmark datasets which are usually considered in zero-shot learning ( such as the `` standard '' ImageNet or classical datasets such as SUN -- see ( Xian et al.2019a ) -- or FLO -- see ( Xian et al.2018 ) .If the two prior aspects will be addressed by the Authors , I would be more than happy to call for a full acceptance . * Post-Rebuttal Evaluation [ FINAL ] * I have thoroughly inspected the revised manuscript and read the response provided by authors . I was pleased in registering that my two requests were taken into consideration by authors who provided a solid sensitivity analysis and additional experimental evidences on ImageNet . Therefore , taking this into account , I am now convinced in raising my original score ( 5 : Marginally below acceptance threshold ) to a full acceptance ( 7 : Good paper , accept ) .", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "reply_text": "Thank you for reviewing our submission and the comprehensive comments ! We are very happy to answer the two aspects with regard to sensitivity and datasets ! * * Q1 * * : Sensitivity . The method is depending upon a number of hyper-parameters ( such as the threshold for the visual/semantic neighbor graphs or the softmax temperature ) . * * A1 * * : We have added one section and Figure 3 to show the effects of the selection for hyperparameters : threshold , temperature , N/K for N-way-K-shot task , propagation steps , etc . For the threshold , we found the performance is similar when the threshold is bigger than cosine ( 30 ) . This is because when the threshold is too small , it does not allow any edges to connect between classes and thus there is no propagation and will damage the performance . The accuracy float is within 2 % when the temperature is chosen between 1-20 . * * Q2 * * : About datasets . Although tiered-ImageNet is a popular benchmark in few-shot learning , there are methods which provide experimental results on the full ImageNet , such as [ b ] . It is not fully clear to which extent the proposed variants of tiered-ImageNet , adapted for zero-shot learning , would improve upon the existing ImageNet specs .
