However, I think in its current form, the paper is not suitable for publication:\n\n- The previous work, that the authors compare to, were not really using comparable architectures: in fact, likely much worse base models with fewer parameters etc. I think any future version of this work would need to control for architecture capacity, otherwise how can we be sure where the gains come from? To me, this is a major unknown in terms of the credit assignment for the great results.\n- The authors should be comparing with MAML (and follow-up work) by Finn et al. (2017)\n- I don't really understand why the authors claim to have no need for validation sets. That's a very strong claim: are ALL the hyper-parameters (model architectures etc) just chosen in another, principled way?

The regularised regression is formulated as a MAP estimation problem with the prior estimated from the weights of the original network connected final hidden layer to the logits \u2014 before the soft-max layer. The motivation of the article regarding \u201cconcepts\u201d is interesting. It seems especially justified when the training set that is used to train the original network has similar objects as the smaller set that is used for k-shot learning. Maps shown in Figures 6 and 7 provide good motivation for this approach. Despite the strong motivation, the article raises some concerns regarding the method. 1. The assumption about independence of w vectors across classes is a very strong one and as far as I can see, it does not have a sound justification. The original networks are trained to distinguish between classes. The weight vectors are estimated with this goal. Therefore, it is very likely that vectors of different classes are highly correlated. Going beyond this assumption also seems difficult. The proposed model estimates $\\theta^{MAP}$ using only one W matrix, the one that is estimated by training the original network in the most usual way. In this case, the prior over $\\theta$ would have a large influence on the MAP estimate and setting it properly becomes important. As far as I can see, there is no good recipe presented in the article for setting this prior. 2. How is the prior model defined? It is the most important component of the method while precise details are not provided. How are the hyperparameters set? Furthermore, this detail needs to be in the main text. 3. With the isotropic assumption on the covariance matrix, the main difference between logistic regression, which is regularized by L2 norm and coefficient set proportional to the empirical variance, and the proposed method seems to be the mean vector $\\mu^{MAP}$. From the details provided in the appendix \u2014 which should be in the main text in my opinion \u2014 I believe this vector is a combination of the prior and mean of w_c across classes. If the prior is set to 0, how different is this vector from 0? Authors should focus on this in my opinion to explain why methods work differently in 1-shot learning. In the other problems, the results suggest they are pretty much the same. 4. Authors\u2019 motivation about concepts is interesting however, if the model bases its prediction on mean of w_c vectors over classes, then I am not sure if authors really achieve what they motivate for. 5. Results are not very convincing. If the method was substantially different than baseline, I believe this would have been no problem. Given the proximity of the proposed method to the baseline with regularised logistic regression, lack of empirical advantage is an issue. If the proposed model works better in the 1-shot scenario, then authors should delve into it to explain the advantage. Minor comments: Evaluation in an online setting section is unclear. It needs to be rewritten in my opinion. ", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Thank you very much for your review ; we reply to it below . Please also read the general reply above . ad 1 ) $ \\theta^ { MAP } $ is estimated using the W matrix from training , but this matrix contains C samples from p ( W|\\theta ) . The importance of the prior vanishes as C increases and is not so fundamental . The softmax likelihood does have an identifiability problem : if all weights are shifted by the same offset then the same probabilities will result . By itself , this can result in dependencies in the weight \u2019 s posterior . However , the L2 regularisation applied in the first phase of learning ( representational learning ) mitigates this effect . Moreover , these dependencies have no effect on the quality of prediction , since by definition predictions are the same for these settings of the weights . We do not believe there are strong additional dependencies between the top-level weights , once the lower layers are fixed . Indeed , once the lower layers are fixed , the average hidden layer activation for a class indicates what a \u2018 good \u2019 setting of the softmax weight for that class will be : the weight should simply lie in the direction of this vector ( see [ 10 ] for a similar argument ) . A related observation lends some support to this argument : pilot experiments showed that -- when the lower level of the network is fixed and the top level weights are retrained several times to classify a class in the context of sets of different randomly selected classes -- the same weight vector is recovered each time for the common class . The conclusion is that the context does not matter , but rather just the representation of that class at the hidden layer . This does not speak directly to dependencies between the weight vectors of different classes , but it is consistent with this hypothesis and may explain the very strong performance of this seemingly overly-simple approach . 2 ) We use a Normal-Inverse-Wishart prior , which is the standard conjugate prior to a Gaussian model and has four hyperparameters , mu_0 , kappa_0 , Lambda_0 , and nu_0 . Standard approaches to set these hyperparameters are discussed in [ Murphy 2012 ] ; we try two approaches : 1 ) a weakly data dependent prior , 2 ) a prior that is set by cross-validation of log probabilities on the weights ( see discussion in the supplement ) . Both approaches yield similar results , and especially for the isotropic model , the results are not very sensitive to the choice of prior parameters . We will clarify in the final version . 3 ) This is correct ; if mu_0is zero , the size of kappa_0 determines how different mu_MAP will be to zero . Typically , this value is chosen to be ( much ) smaller than one ( Murphy 2012 ) , such that mu_MAP is non-zero , even in the one-shot case . 4 ) We agree that the concept transfer is limited to very few parameters in our experiments . Our experiments on CIFAR ( e.g. , Figure 10 ) show that there is no advantage , on this dataset , for using a more structured model , such as a mixture of Gaussians . However , the framework we present is general and allows for more elaborate probabilistic models leading to more ambitious concept transfer . Models such as the Gaussian latent feature model presented in Section 5.1 of [ Griffiths , Ghahramani 2011 ] could be considered . Our results are a first step in this direction , and we see this as an exciting direction of future work for datasets with a higher number of classes . 5 ) We achieve state-of-the-art results by a large margin over competing methods , and the success of our approach should be measured against the current reference methods in the literature . Previous state of the art papers only compare to nearest neighbours with a very shallow network and , in particular , never compare to logistic regression , which is a much stronger baseline . Our approach is orthogonal to previous methods . On the considered datasets , learning deep features already helps the baselines ( NN and LRCV ) to beat other state of the art methods . We aimed to convey that our choice of probabilistic model is closely related to logistic regression , which we do not deem a disadvantage . Indeed , one message of the paper is that something as simple as logistic regression can beat all current methods , which has important implications for k-shot learning problems and how they should be tackled . We do not increase in accuracy substantially , but we get better calibration , which is often desirable ( e.g. , situations where making mistakes is expensive , such as self driving cars ) . Moreover , the results clearly show that using standard cross-validation leads to worse accuracy and much worse calibration , and , in particular , is not possible for 1-shot learning . In this regard , logistic regression using the weight variance as regularization is a proposed method , and not a baseline , which we will stress in the main text . 6 ) Thank you for pointing out that this section is not clear enough ; we are happy to improve it .
