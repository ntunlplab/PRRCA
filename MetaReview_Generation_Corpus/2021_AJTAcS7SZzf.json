'' * We will include CASED in the related works and would like to discuss and clarify the significant differences between the proposed method and CASED . As we understand , CASED is a data re-sampling framework dedicated to train robust segmentation models for highly imbalanced datasets , in particular for lung nodule detection . We would like to point out two fundamental differences between two methods . Firstly , the AutoSampling method is a general method which by its formulation does not rely on any prior or condition of the datasets , while CASED assumes the dataset to be highly imbalanced and its formulation depends on the lung nodule detection itself . Secondly , the goal of AutoSampling is to find an optimal sampling schedule capable of transferring among different models , while CASED is intended to train robust segmentation models for lung nodule detection . The potential generalizability and purpose of the two methods are quite different to our understanding . * `` It is not clear to me what the intuition of P ( x ) is . If H * is the `` optimal sampling schedule '' and then P is defined to be the ratio of x in H * over all x in H * then it is not clear to me what you are converging to . '' * We wish to further clarify on our notations . $ P ( x ) $ as defined in Equation 5 in Section 3.2 is the sampling distribution estimated from the recorded optimal sampling schedule $ \\mathbf { H } ^ * $ collected from the last multi-exploitation step . Both $ P ( x ) $ ( or $ P ( D ) $ ) and $ \\mathbf { H } ^ * $ denotes the current local optimum , which are recorded and used to further search in the sampling distribution space . What we are interested in finding is the recorded optimal sampling schedules $ \\mathbf { H } ^ * $ from all the multi-exploitation steps , as defined as in the last sentence of Section 3.2 . * `` The replicate runs seem to almost have no variance . It is the case that only the model init was varied between runs with fixed train/valid/test sets ? If so this does not seem sufficient to confirm that this method works because the data you sample from is always the same . This should be randomized at least for CIFAR . '' * We do run the CIFAR-10/100 experiments with randomized model weight initializations and sampling schedules . We do this to rule out the fluctuations on performance , which is a common practice for running experiments on small-scale datasets in computer vision and AutoML literatures [ 1,2 ] . It is also a common practice in computer vision literatures to run experiments with fixed train/validation/test datasets for the fair comparison between concurrent works . Reference 1 .
