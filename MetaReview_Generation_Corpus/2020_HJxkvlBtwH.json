A1 : Thank you for the suggestion , we will extend our background section with the description of existing approaches for certification of neural networks . In the meantime , here we provide short summary : Most existing state-of-the-art scalable certification methods aim to capture all possible behaviors of a neural network using convex relaxations . In this perspective , we treat the input with the predefined perturbation range as a multi-dimensional polyhedron and pass it through the operations within the network . The most basic approach here uses interval propagation - it maintains the minimum and maximum possible value for each neuron in the network . More recent work ( listed in Section 2 ) presents more elaborate relaxations to capture the propagation of the initial perturbation through the network . Robustness certification is performed by checking whether the neuron corresponding to the true label is always greater than neurons corresponding to other labels with respect to the input region . If this is true , then we can establish the network correctly classifies the input under all possible realized perturbations . We will further elaborate on this in the next revision . Q2 : The so-called audio processing pipeline here is actually speech processing pipeline . I am not sure if `` audio '' is the right term in a strict sense .

The network is based on a simple pipeline starting from MFCC to make an utterance level classifier via a last hidden state of an LSTM acoustic model. This approach can perform analysis through this pipeline. I feel that this paper is very difficult to follow because of the lack of background technique explanations based on neural network certification, and the lack of technical surveys of speech recognition and related areas. This paper requires such major restructuring and more surveys to make it in good shape. Comments - The authors only list CTC related techniques as state-of-the-art ASR, but state-of-the-art ASR is still based on the HMM/DNN hybrid system or attention-based encoder-decoder/RNN transducer. They seriously lack the surveys o this area. Also several technical terminologies are not common in the speech recognition are (e.g., automated speech recognition --> automatic speech recognition) - \"Additionally, audio systems typically use recurrent architectures (Chiu et al., 2017)\": There are a lot of state-of-the-art ASR systems including TDNN (Kaldi), CNN, and transformer. Again the paper does not have enough surveys. - The font size of the characters in figure 1 is too small. - I cannot understand why the paper uses MFCC.

A1 : Certification of neural networks is an emerging area which aims to prove the robustness of neural networks against adversarial perturbations . For an introduction to the area , we refer the reviewer to related work listed in the introduction , particularly [ 1 ] which provides a unifying framework for many of the existing approaches . You can also check the answer we provide to Reviewer 2 for more technical details . Certification of neural networks is still at an early stage and none of the existing approaches scales to state-of-the-art networks and datasets ( e.g.ImageNet ) . While here we do not directly consider the state-of-the-art architectures you listed , our method for certifying recurrent networks is general and can be applied to those architectures as well . However , certification methods for computer vision tasks have scaled from verifying small networks with 200 neurons to large residual networks with thousands of neurons and we expect the same progress in the audio domain in the future . Our work is the first one to certify audio classifiers . None of the existing approaches can handle this task and are mostly limited to computer vision .

One of the contributions of this work is the development of abstract transformers which can be used for the data processing frontend used in typical audio applications. The work also proposes an abstract transformers for LSTMs which is stated to be much faster to use in practice than previous work. Overall, this work is interesting and I think it would be a great addition to the conference. The paper is generally well written in the initial sections, and the main ideas are very clearly presented. However, there are a number of missing details, particularly in the final sections which discuss the experimental validation. In its present form, I am rating this work as \u201cweak reject\u201d, but I would increase my scores if the authors can improve the final sections in the revised draft. Main Comments: 1. While I found section 3 to be useful to get an intuition of the proposed method, I still feel that it could be condensed a bit to add in additional details. For example, the authors don\u2019t describe \u201cback-substitution\u201d in the work, which I believe should be described in the main text. 2. A clarification question: When computing provability, the authors state that \u201cWe randomly shuffled the test data and then, for every experiment, inferred labels one by one until the number of correctly classified samples reached 100. We report the number of provably correct samples out of these 100 as our provability.\u201d How sensitive was the provability metric to the choice of these 100 test examples? Was the metric computed by repeatedly sampling 100 test cases, for example? 3. The section on \u201cProvable defense for audio classifiers\u201d was not very clear to me. The authors state that \u201cTo train, we combine standard loss with the worst case loss obtained using interval propagation.\u201d I was not clear on what the modified loss is. Could the authors please clarify this in the text, preferably a mathematical formulation? Also, I\u2019m curious why these experiments are only conducted on the FSDD set, but not on the GSC set. 4. Figure 5c. Why does the interval analysis technique perform so much worse on the GSC set relative to the FSDD set? On a related note, it would also be useful to describe some more details about the model architectures for the two tasks. 5. The section on \u201cExperimental comparison with prior work\u201d similarly left me with a number of questions. The authors mention that \u201cWe found that, in practice, optimization approach used by POPQORN produces approximations of slightly smaller volume than our LSTM transformer (although non-comparable).\u201d Could these be quantified and reported in the paper. Also, why are the approximation volumes not comparable between the two systems. Minor comment: It is true that most works in audio classification and speech recognition use processed frontend features such as MFCCs. However, there is also a significant body of work which operates directly on the time-domain signal. Perhaps it would be better to clarify this in the text?

We have not described back-substitution in full detail in the main text as it is not part of our main contributions . Full details of this algorithm can be found in [ 1 ] . We also provide full derivation of bounds in our overview example using back-substitution in Appendix C. Q2 : How sensitive was the provability metric to the choice of these 100 test examples ? A2 : To check the sensitivity of our results to the choice of 100 samples that we verified we ran the verification on 10 random permutations of our test set ( each time with a different seed ) . We describe this experiment in Appendix F and show the verification results in Figure 9 with error bars indicating the variance .

Q4 : Why does the interval analysis technique perform so much worse on the GSC set relative to the FSDD set ? Could you describe more details about the model architectures used for the two tasks ? A4 : Based on our experiments , we believe that certifying GSC is more difficult for two reasons : ( i ) the main factor which impacts provability is the number of frames \u2014 each additional frame causes accumulation of errors introduced by loose convex relaxations which ultimately makes the certification more likely to fail . This reflects in the fact that GSC , where samples have 19 frames on average , is significantly more difficult to certify than FSDD which has samples with 15 frames on average , and ( ii ) given that GSC and FSDD have 30 and 10 output classes , respectively , in the case of GSC verifier needs to prove that the final logit of correct class is greater than the logit of all other 29 classes which is naturally more difficult than proving it for only 9 other classes as is the case with FSDD .
