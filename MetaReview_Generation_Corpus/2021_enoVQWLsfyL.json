First , the view generator should be able to generate multiple diverse views from a single image , while most processes for generating adversarial examples are approximately deterministic ( modulo small differences due to random seeds ) . Second , multiple iterations of e.g.PGD are expensive , while our method can amortize that cost and even use a smaller , cheaper model to do so . * * '' Even though there might be differences in experimental settings and a linear classifier is used here , the gap between the results here and in the literature is too significant to make a solid conclusion based on the results , as the gain can potentially disappear when a stronger backend classifier is applied . Good to discuss this . `` * * \\ We 'll be sure to characterize this clearly in the next revision , that we are mainly comparing to an equivalent SimCLR model on linear evaluation , and not larger , supervised SOTA models trained end-to-end on the transfer task , which would be expected to have much higher accuracy . * * '' Top-5 accuracy [ for VoxCeleb ] \u2026 is good to specify in the paper as well . `` * * \\ Great suggestion , we have these numbers here and will include them in the next revision : resnet18 , 100hr \\ expert time | top1 : 0.05774 , | top5 : 0.13216 \\ expert spectral | top1 : 0.07666 | top5 : 0.16076 \\ viewmaker 0.05 | top1 : 0.13122 | top5 : 0.24987 \\ viewmaker 0.1 | top1 : 0.09753 | top5 : 0.20434 resnet50 , 960hr \\ expert spectral | top1 : 0.08618 | top5 : 0.16882 \\ viewmaker 0.05 | top1 : 0.10751 | top5 : 0.21923 * * '' In general , the experimental settings for the speech experiments are unclear even after reading the supplementary material . `` * * \\ Thank you for letting us know .

The method consists of learning an adversarial perturbation model that aims to maximize the distance between the original image and its perturbed views in the space of learned representations . To avoid collapse to a completely information-destroying perturbation model , authors propose to limit the perturbation strength in terms of the $ l_p $ norm of the added noise . Authors apply their method on various image , speech and wearable sensor datasets where the proposed approach provides an improvement over other methods . Paper strengths : 1 . The general idea of automating data augmentations for self-supervised learning seems very reasonable to me and adversarial training framework is a very viable option to implement these ideas . 2.The method does show an empirical improvement over SimCLR . Paper weaknesses : 1 . Recent and relevant work of Grill et al , 2015 `` Bootstrap your own latent : A new approach to self-supervised Learning '' is not even mentioned and not used as a baseline in the experimental comparison . 2.The particular form of additive perturbation considered in the paper seems somewhat limiting to me . For example , various rotations , contrast and saturation manipulations in the image domain are very difficult to reproduce within this framework and would result into a very high $ l_p $ difference from the original image . It would be interesting to see if these transformations when added to the learned ones result into even better performance . 3.While I do appreciate a quite broad selection of data domains in the experiments , I think it is important to also evaluate the proposed method on ImageNet since it is a major and established benchmark with enough complexity that makes good representations really necessary for a god performance . Overall , I like the paper and would gladly increase my rating if authors could address the points above .", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We thank R2 for the constructive and positive review . * * '' Recent and relevant work of Grill et al , 2015 `` Bootstrap your own latent : A new approach to self-supervised Learning '' is not even mentioned and not used as a baseline in the experimental comparison . `` * * \\ Thanks for this catch\u2014a more recent version of our paper mentions that our method is fully compatible with BYOL , in addition to other view-based methods like MoCo , Local Aggregation , etc .

While the \\ell_1 constraint performs well , we believe there is ample opportunity for developing other kinds of domain-agnostic constraints , whether through other kinds of metrics ( e.g.Wasserstein distance ) or other ways of bounding the complexity of the perturbation ( e.g.applying the perturbations in frequency space , as we explore ) . * * It would be interesting to see if these transformations when added to the learned ones result into even better performance . * * \\ Great suggestion , thanks ! We only had time to run transfer for a single Combined model ( below ) , and did not see improvements in downstream performance .

Unfortunately , we simply lack the resources needed to competitively train models at this scale .
