We discuss the raised weaknesses consecutively and have numbered them to be precise : 1 ) The masked-based interpretation methods alluded by the reviewer are predominantly for models that use masking during model building \u2013 like in Language ( Lei et al.16 , Bastings et al. \u2018 19 , Invase ICLR \u2019 19 ) . We are crucially different in that we operate only on the trained model \u2013 the post-hoc setting . We have no access to the parameters of the trained model . We only assume that we have access to the final prediction . We also accept that there are parallels to the above masking methods . However , where we crucially differ from existing \u201c masking methods \u201d ( although NOT post-hoc ) is that we measure the fidelity in expectation by sampling multiple instances . This provides our fidelity estimates necessary robustness that is missing in earlier works . The rate-distortion theory merely provides a theoretical framework on which we ground our fidelity measure . 2 ) Our method is a local interpretability method . We explain the class label predicted for a single node . For the explained node , we currently use the same feature mask for all selected neighbors to reduce the explanation 's complexity . It would be easy to extend our method such that we search for each node in the computational graph its feature mask . 3 ) In short , we do not recalculate the orderings RF and RV because we did not observe any performance gains from doing so and initializing them already has the highest impact on our runtime . We have added a section in the appendix ( see Appendix A ) explaining the reasoning for our algorithm 's design choices . 4 ) The contribution is not merely the greedy algorithm , which is simple , as the reviewer rightly points out . Our major contribution is proposing a principled framework under which the validity of GNN models ' explanations can be measured . In doing so , we intend to enrich the underexplored area of GNN explainability by proposing our fidelity measure . Also , the insights from our `` simple '' approach ( 1 ) already showcase the limitations of existing approaches [ Section 4.1 ] , ( 2 ) is empirically superior to the existing approach [ sections 4.2 , 4.4 , 4.5 ] , and ( 3 ) shows how explanations can be used to inspect trained models [ Section 4.3 ] . These utility experiments , to the best of our knowledge , have completely been missing in the literature . 5 ) We have rewritten the description of our algorithm to make it easier to understand . In addition , we have added a lengthy description of all details in Appendix A . 6 ) We now include some example explanations for the synthetic dataset . See Figure 13 and Figure 14 for correctly and wrongly predicted nodes ."}, {"review_id": "uDN8pRAdsoC-2", "review_text": "The authors propose ZORRO , a post-hoc explanation method for node classification with graph neural network architectures . ZORRO leverages rate-distortion theory to generate masks that select nodes in the target node neighbourhood and their most important features . * The problem is very relevant to the GNN community , and I am glad to see more works coming in on this topic . * The idea of relying on rate-distortion theory is interesting and original , and to the best of my knowledge this is the first time I see it used to tackle this research problem . * The paper is well structured and organised . * The original contribution is sufficient . * Related work is sufficiently well covered . Nevertheless , the paper suffers from shortcomings : A ) The paper claims that ZORRO can generate multiple , disjoint explanations , apparently all highly faithful . This seems to be at odds with the authors ' claim to explain the behaviour of the model . In other words , if I were on the receiving side and I was given multiple _disjoint_ explanations , which one should I trust more ? How can explanations shed a light on the behaviour of models if they are disjoint ? I see ZORRO is able to generate overlapping explanations as well ( a property compatible for example with example-based technique in XAI literature such as counterfactual explanations ) , but I have mixed feelings on the effectiveness of disjoint explanations in practice . B ) A drawback of this work is the complete absence of human-based evaluation . I acknowledge explainable AI literature is ripe with examples of accepted papers , but the authors seem to deliberately disregard this aspect ( \u201c We [ .. ] are not interested if an explanation is congruent to human understanding '' , Sec1 ) . If humans are not important , then what is the reason you explain your predictions ? If the goal is limiting to debugging a model , perhaps the narrative should be revisited . All in all , I believe users should be central in an XAI piece , and papers in this area should help the reader understand if the generated explanations meet users expectations - even in a ML conference such ICLR , even for a 8-page paper . C ) The paper does not include any examples of the generated explanations . It is hard to figure out if the claimed fidelity brings meaningful results in practice , and the reader is left with this doubt . Aside from a full-fledged evaluation campaign ( see A. above ) , some examples would really help make the case . D ) Experiments do not include any evidence of whether ZORRO explanations work in practice . Besides , as I mentioned above , the author should probably clarify which audience they are targeting ( i.e engineers debugging a model , end users trying to understand the reasons for a specific model outcome , etc . ) E ) I was expecting experiments to assess the impact of \\tau ( the user-defined fidelity threshold ) . The authors experiment with .98 and .85 - and \u201c the choice of \\tau has limited influence \u201d , but I would have expected empirical evidence for such statements ( i.e.experiments on a wider range of \\tau , to assess size and fidelity ) . If choosing a desired fidelity is not crucial , the paper should show so . F ) There are not experiments on runtime complexity . The reader is left without evidence of how long it takes to generate an explanation for a target prediction . G ) It is unclear if ZORRO achieves more faithful and also smaller explanations than GNNExplainer . Sec 4.2 suffers from clarity issues , as long as Figure 5 . H ) Some sections could be better clarified , to help the reader understand important aspects of the work : Example : In sec1 , the \u201c notations \u201d paragraph would benefit from proofreading and re-wording . Sec 4.2 could also be refined . Minor : * Size matters for explanations , but smaller does not always mean better . For example , in medical decision support systems , some clinicians may prefer longer and more thorough explanations . Your milage may vary . * Figure 5 is poorly legible . * Some typos along the way ( e.g. \u201c denotes the binary column vector of selected nodes and Fs denote the binary row vector of selected nodes \u201c sec 1 , \u201c Effectively the complete input is presented as an input \u201d in 4.2 ) Questions for the authors : * Q1 ) How does ZORRO decide the size of each computational graph to work with ( i.e.the size of the neighbourhood ) ? * Q1 ) It is not entirely clear to me how you ZORRO generates multiple explanations ? I could not find how this is done in Algorithms 1-3 . Could you please clarify ?", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Thanks for the kind and positive comment . We view our paper as a step towards a better evaluation of post-hoc interpretability approaches for GNNs , and we are pleased about the constructive comments that allow us to reflect on the limitations of the current evaluation regimes . Our detailed response to your raised points : A ) We intend to exactly shed light on the multiple-explanation limitation of the existing GNN explanation approaches . Unlike existing approaches that output a SINGLE explanation , we experimentally show that multiple explanations exist with better or similar fidelity as the soft explanation . Therefore , an expectation that there is ONE perfect explanation might indeed be misplaced . There are multiple possible reasons for a given prediction based on the feature and neighborhoods , and outputting only one of them is akin to not making the user aware of the real evidence . We choose to output multiple disjoint explanations as a lower bound on the potential number of explanations that could exist . We expect that there are many overlapping explanations . We accept the concern that the beneficiary of multiple explanations would not guide the user to improve the model or localize potential spurious correlations . Still , through this paper , we want to question the assumption ( or expectation ) that a single explanation provides a complete picture of the inner workings of a GNN . B ) We accept the claim that explanations are meant for users and hence should be evaluated by humans . However , in our opinion , what can be assessed by a human is the explanation style and not the effectiveness of explanations . In this regard , soft masking techniques that output a probability distribution over features or nodes are well-known to be less interpretable to humans than hard masks as explanations . This is especially true when dealing with large number of features as in our experiments ( Cora has > 1K features , and some nodes have a very high outdegree ) . However , we would want to point out a central limitation of existing works in the human evaluation of explanation methods . Human evaluation regimes where a human is showed multiple explanations and is asked to choose the best explanation is fraught with multiple biases and is not a true indicator of \u201c goodness of the explanation \u201d . Why ? Imagine there are two explanations to a GNN prediction . ( a ) An incorrect explanation that corresponds to human understanding ( say Homophily ) and ( b ) another correct that does not align with human understanding ( a spurious correlation perhaps ) . In such cases , the Human evaluation might incorrectly evaluate the wrong explanation . This has been routinely observed for post-hoc explanation methods in text and images ( cite Rigorous Science of Interpretability by Been Kim & Doshi Velez ) . All post-hoc interpretability approaches face similar threats when using human explanations . Consequently , we propose an information-theoretic point of view : If an explanation is correct , it must be predictive . C ) We have included some examples for the newly added synthetic dataset , which showcase our approach 's results . Please take a look at Figures 13 and 14 . D ) This a valid comment about the stakeholders that we target . We make it more explicit that our explanations are mainly targeted towards model builders , designers , and practitioners of GNNs . We see Zorro 's utility in the evaluation and debugging phase to get insights into the model under question . Our utility experiments showcase one possible way in which Zorro was used to create visualizations that shed some light on the learning behavior of GNNs ."}], "0": {"review_id": "uDN8pRAdsoC-0", "review_text": "The authors address the problem of explaining the behaviour of graph neural networks ( which operate on a computation graph based on their k-hop neighbourhood ) such as a graph convolutional network ( GCN ) .

Then I believe the technical contribution may not reach the bar of ICLR . - The algorithm is not clearly explained . What \u2019 s the meaning of $ V_r $ , $ F_r $ , $ R_ { V_p } $ , and $ R_ { F_p } $ , etc . ? How are they initialized ? - For the comparisons with GNN-Explainer , we need to see some real examples\u2014explanations for both correct predictions and incorrect predictions . It is not enough to just report numerical numbers . I am willing to adjust my score if my concerns are properly addressed . ==Update after rebuttal== I have read the authors ' rebuttal . However , my concerns are not well addressed . 1.There are a lot mask based methods for interpretation in different domains [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] . Existing methods [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] are providing post-doc explanations for a pretrained model . I still believe `` the connection between the proposed method and data compression is not convincing '' . 2.I still believe the novelty is limited . Hence , I am keeping my score unchanged .

We discuss the raised weaknesses consecutively and have numbered them to be precise : 1 ) The masked-based interpretation methods alluded by the reviewer are predominantly for models that use masking during model building \u2013 like in Language ( Lei et al.16 , Bastings et al. \u2018 19 , Invase ICLR \u2019 19 ) . We are crucially different in that we operate only on the trained model \u2013 the post-hoc setting . We have no access to the parameters of the trained model . We only assume that we have access to the final prediction . We also accept that there are parallels to the above masking methods . However , where we crucially differ from existing \u201c masking methods \u201d ( although NOT post-hoc ) is that we measure the fidelity in expectation by sampling multiple instances . This provides our fidelity estimates necessary robustness that is missing in earlier works . The rate-distortion theory merely provides a theoretical framework on which we ground our fidelity measure . 2 ) Our method is a local interpretability method . We explain the class label predicted for a single node . For the explained node , we currently use the same feature mask for all selected neighbors to reduce the explanation 's complexity . It would be easy to extend our method such that we search for each node in the computational graph its feature mask . 3 ) In short , we do not recalculate the orderings RF and RV because we did not observe any performance gains from doing so and initializing them already has the highest impact on our runtime . We have added a section in the appendix ( see Appendix A ) explaining the reasoning for our algorithm 's design choices . 4 ) The contribution is not merely the greedy algorithm , which is simple , as the reviewer rightly points out . Our major contribution is proposing a principled framework under which the validity of GNN models ' explanations can be measured . In doing so , we intend to enrich the underexplored area of GNN explainability by proposing our fidelity measure . Also , the insights from our `` simple '' approach ( 1 ) already showcase the limitations of existing approaches [ Section 4.1 ] , ( 2 ) is empirically superior to the existing approach [ sections 4.2 , 4.4 , 4.5 ] , and ( 3 ) shows how explanations can be used to inspect trained models [ Section 4.3 ] . These utility experiments , to the best of our knowledge , have completely been missing in the literature . 5 ) We have rewritten the description of our algorithm to make it easier to understand . In addition , we have added a lengthy description of all details in Appendix A . 6 ) We now include some example explanations for the synthetic dataset . See Figure 13 and Figure 14 for correctly and wrongly predicted nodes ."}, "2": {"review_id": "uDN8pRAdsoC-2", "review_text": "The authors propose ZORRO , a post-hoc explanation method for node classification with graph neural network architectures . ZORRO leverages rate-distortion theory to generate masks that select nodes in the target node neighbourhood and their most important features . * The problem is very relevant to the GNN community , and I am glad to see more works coming in on this topic . * The idea of relying on rate-distortion theory is interesting and original , and to the best of my knowledge this is the first time I see it used to tackle this research problem . * The paper is well structured and organised . * The original contribution is sufficient . * Related work is sufficiently well covered . Nevertheless , the paper suffers from shortcomings : A ) The paper claims that ZORRO can generate multiple , disjoint explanations , apparently all highly faithful . This seems to be at odds with the authors ' claim to explain the behaviour of the model . In other words , if I were on the receiving side and I was given multiple _disjoint_ explanations , which one should I trust more ? How can explanations shed a light on the behaviour of models if they are disjoint ? I see ZORRO is able to generate overlapping explanations as well ( a property compatible for example with example-based technique in XAI literature such as counterfactual explanations ) , but I have mixed feelings on the effectiveness of disjoint explanations in practice . B ) A drawback of this work is the complete absence of human-based evaluation . I acknowledge explainable AI literature is ripe with examples of accepted papers , but the authors seem to deliberately disregard this aspect ( \u201c We [ .. ] are not interested if an explanation is congruent to human understanding '' , Sec1 ) . If humans are not important , then what is the reason you explain your predictions ? If the goal is limiting to debugging a model , perhaps the narrative should be revisited . All in all , I believe users should be central in an XAI piece , and papers in this area should help the reader understand if the generated explanations meet users expectations - even in a ML conference such ICLR , even for a 8-page paper . C ) The paper does not include any examples of the generated explanations . It is hard to figure out if the claimed fidelity brings meaningful results in practice , and the reader is left with this doubt . Aside from a full-fledged evaluation campaign ( see A. above ) , some examples would really help make the case . D ) Experiments do not include any evidence of whether ZORRO explanations work in practice . Besides , as I mentioned above , the author should probably clarify which audience they are targeting ( i.e engineers debugging a model , end users trying to understand the reasons for a specific model outcome , etc . ) E ) I was expecting experiments to assess the impact of \\tau ( the user-defined fidelity threshold ) . The authors experiment with .98 and .85 - and \u201c the choice of \\tau has limited influence \u201d , but I would have expected empirical evidence for such statements ( i.e.experiments on a wider range of \\tau , to assess size and fidelity ) . If choosing a desired fidelity is not crucial , the paper should show so . F ) There are not experiments on runtime complexity . The reader is left without evidence of how long it takes to generate an explanation for a target prediction . G ) It is unclear if ZORRO achieves more faithful and also smaller explanations than GNNExplainer . Sec 4.2 suffers from clarity issues , as long as Figure 5 . H ) Some sections could be better clarified , to help the reader understand important aspects of the work : Example : In sec1 , the \u201c notations \u201d paragraph would benefit from proofreading and re-wording . Sec 4.2 could also be refined . Minor : * Size matters for explanations , but smaller does not always mean better . For example , in medical decision support systems , some clinicians may prefer longer and more thorough explanations . Your milage may vary . * Figure 5 is poorly legible . * Some typos along the way ( e.g. \u201c denotes the binary column vector of selected nodes and Fs denote the binary row vector of selected nodes \u201c sec 1 , \u201c Effectively the complete input is presented as an input \u201d in 4.2 ) Questions for the authors : * Q1 ) How does ZORRO decide the size of each computational graph to work with ( i.e.the size of the neighbourhood ) ? * Q1 ) It is not entirely clear to me how you ZORRO generates multiple explanations ? I could not find how this is done in Algorithms 1-3 . Could you please clarify ?", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Thanks for the kind and positive comment . We view our paper as a step towards a better evaluation of post-hoc interpretability approaches for GNNs , and we are pleased about the constructive comments that allow us to reflect on the limitations of the current evaluation regimes . Our detailed response to your raised points : A ) We intend to exactly shed light on the multiple-explanation limitation of the existing GNN explanation approaches . Unlike existing approaches that output a SINGLE explanation , we experimentally show that multiple explanations exist with better or similar fidelity as the soft explanation . Therefore , an expectation that there is ONE perfect explanation might indeed be misplaced . There are multiple possible reasons for a given prediction based on the feature and neighborhoods , and outputting only one of them is akin to not making the user aware of the real evidence . We choose to output multiple disjoint explanations as a lower bound on the potential number of explanations that could exist . We expect that there are many overlapping explanations . We accept the concern that the beneficiary of multiple explanations would not guide the user to improve the model or localize potential spurious correlations . Still , through this paper , we want to question the assumption ( or expectation ) that a single explanation provides a complete picture of the inner workings of a GNN . B ) We accept the claim that explanations are meant for users and hence should be evaluated by humans . However , in our opinion , what can be assessed by a human is the explanation style and not the effectiveness of explanations . In this regard , soft masking techniques that output a probability distribution over features or nodes are well-known to be less interpretable to humans than hard masks as explanations . This is especially true when dealing with large number of features as in our experiments ( Cora has > 1K features , and some nodes have a very high outdegree ) . However , we would want to point out a central limitation of existing works in the human evaluation of explanation methods . Human evaluation regimes where a human is showed multiple explanations and is asked to choose the best explanation is fraught with multiple biases and is not a true indicator of \u201c goodness of the explanation \u201d . Why ? Imagine there are two explanations to a GNN prediction . ( a ) An incorrect explanation that corresponds to human understanding ( say Homophily ) and ( b ) another correct that does not align with human understanding ( a spurious correlation perhaps ) . In such cases , the Human evaluation might incorrectly evaluate the wrong explanation . This has been routinely observed for post-hoc explanation methods in text and images ( cite Rigorous Science of Interpretability by Been Kim & Doshi Velez ) . All post-hoc interpretability approaches face similar threats when using human explanations . Consequently , we propose an information-theoretic point of view : If an explanation is correct , it must be predictive . C ) We have included some examples for the newly added synthetic dataset , which showcase our approach 's results . Please take a look at Figures 13 and 14 . D ) This a valid comment about the stakeholders that we target . We make it more explicit that our explanations are mainly targeted towards model builders , designers , and practitioners of GNNs . We see Zorro 's utility in the evaluation and debugging phase to get insights into the model under question . Our utility experiments showcase one possible way in which Zorro was used to create visualizations that shed some light on the learning behavior of GNNs ."}}
