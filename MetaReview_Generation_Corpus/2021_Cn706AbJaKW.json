The goal of the study is to answer questions like how is the reproducibility or what is the bias in the review process . In general the paper makes some timely attempts for the conference review process . Here are some of my concerns : - In Sec 3.1 , the authors basically assume that papers with similar mean review scores have similar variability in scores . I think more justifications are needed for this assumption . - In Sec 5.1 , the authors only consider the average reviewer score , and an indicator variable for whether a paper came from one of the top 10 most highly ranked institutions as two factors for ACs to make the decision . I think the ACs decision process is too simplified . The same problem exists for other sections when the authors try to fit a logistic regression model between the acceptance decisions and a number of factors that the authors pre-select . The authors may want to clearly explain if only these factors contribute to the final decision ( other confounding issues matter ? ) , or if the relationship could be captured by a LR model . - In Sec 5.4 , the authors assigned labels based on gendered pronouns appearing on personal webpages when possible , and on the use of canonically gendered names otherwise . The authors should report some statistics for how accurate this process is .", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Thank you for your feedback . We address your comments below . 1 ) In the appendix , we examine the statistical assumptions of ANOVA , and we included a plot of variance as a function of reviewer score in order to justify this choice . We found that variance was similar for papers with moderate and borderline scores , and variance was somewhat lower for papers with extremely high or low marks . This latter category of papers is uncommon . 2 ) It is true that our study focuses on a number of hand chosen factors . We have made efforts to sort out several confounding variables , and in fact a number of studies that appear in the paper were the result of us trying to remove a confounding variable ( e.g.Appearance on arxiv , breakdown of papers over topics , and the removing the effect of paper acceptance on citation rates ) . We would also point out that our ability to do multi-factor studies is limited by the size of our dataset . For example it is not possible to simultaneously study the effect of gender and institution rank because there are not nearly enough women authors at ICLR to get statistically meaningful results regarding gender after the dataset is sliced into bins based on institution . Finally , there are certainly many potential confounding variables that we did not eliminate , and many that we are not aware of . We can not control for all of these confounders , but we think it \u2019 s important to acknowledge that they exist . We will add an acknowledgment of this weakness in the conclusion . 3 ) We used a two-step process to label gender . First , we do a manual search for an author \u2019 s webpage or CV , and use the gender assignment of their self-selected pronouns when possible . If this information is not available , then we assign a gender label based on the author \u2019 s name . Note that name-based gender labelling is commonly done in the gender studies literature , and studies have shown that name-based gender labelling is reasonably accurate in many scenarios , with over 98 % accuracy observed using a range of different name databases when the name labeling system is allowed to abstain if presented with a gender-ambiguous name ( see [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] below ) . We chose our two-step process over a totally automated name/gender database lookup process for two reasons . First , it is known that name-gender databases tend to be largely built using western data sources and tend to have lower accuracy on names of Asian origin [ 1 ] . Furthermore , these databases may fail due to cultural differences in how names are gendered across regions ( e.g. , \u201c Andrea \u201d is a canonically female name in the US , but canonically male in Italy ) . Because of the highly international nature of ICLR ( and in particular the large number of authors from South and East Asia ) , we wanted a closely supervised process with humans in the loop rather than relying solely on a database .

Quality : The authors put a lot of effort in collecting and cleaning the data , which is not easy . The authors did thorough statistical analysis over the data and considered many possible pitfalls . I still have some questions but I think it 's of good value for the community to see and discuss the paper in the conference . Clarity : The paper is well written and easy to follow .

Detailed comments : 1 ) Page 1 , intro : What do you mean by `` censorship '' here ? 2 ) Page 1 last paragraph .

Global % could be lower . 12 ) Page 8 Conclusion . This is a weak point , Conclusion is not supported by the content of the paper , but more like a speculation .", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Thank you for your insight . We address each of your comments below . 1.Some authors feel that papers may be rejected because they present competition for other authors , because of personal conflicts , or other reasons unrelated to paper \u201c quality. \u201d We agree that \u201c censorship \u201d is both vague and overly harsh , so we have changed it to \u201c a process orthogonal to meritocracy \u201d . 2.We are not suggesting that reviewers and ACs look up papers on arXiv specifically to find out the authors \u2019 genders , but any reviewer who knows the author list may coincidentally know the authors \u2019 genders . We would point out that there are many ways that the review process is not blind . It is fairly common for a reviewer to be assigned a paper that they are already familiar with from arXiv ( or a workshop venue ) , or from a talk that they \u2019 ve seen . Also , while this is officially prohibited by reviewing guidelines , we suspect that many reviewers search arXiv for papers regardless . That being said , we suspect that much of the difference in scores that we observe is the result of the well-documented \u201c achievement gap \u201d between men and women in the sciences ( the citations at the top of section 5.4 ) . Women tend to have smaller peer groups than men in computer science ( and in scientific fields at large ) that result in worse learning outcomes , lower productivity levels , or may prompt women to leave the field all together . This effect might be particularly strong at ICLR , where roughly 1 out of 10 first or last authors are male . 3.Thank you for pointing this out . We have clarified this in our current version . There are a total of 5569 papers over 4 years . ICLR 2020 had 2560 submissions , ICLR 2019 had 1565 , ICLR 2018 had 960 , and ICLR 2017 had 490 . 4.We agree that the variation in scores and AC decisions is useful . We think our results already contain this , and we agree that we should feature these numbers more prominently . The ANOVA measures the variation between reviewer scores when controlling for paper \u201c quality \u201d ( i.e. , the expected paper score ) . The ANOVA model finds that reviewer scores have a standard deviation of 1.72 , and this is reported in the main body of the paper . Quantifying randomness in the AC judgements is more complex , since AC judgements depend strongly on scores ; a low scoring paper will nearly always be rejected ( no significant variation in AC judgment ) , and a high scoring paper will always be accepted . Likewise , assuming a continuous model , there exists a paper score for which an AC will have a 50 % chance of accepting a paper , and so reporting the worst-case randomness is not particularly interesting . Rather , we address the problem in Figure 2 , where we show that if the number of reviewers is infinity ( i.e. , we completely remove the randomness in reviewer scores , and all randomness comes from the AC ) then the re-acceptance rate is 75 % . This means that , for an average accepted paper , a randomly chosen AC has a 75 % chance of agreeing that the paper should be accepted . We have now added figures depicting the reproducibility of rejections and of all papers overall . 5.It \u2019 s true that there are more sophisticated goodness of fit tests . We presented HL because it is the most standard method . HL \u2019 s main weakness is that it is vulnerable to overfitting . In our case , the model has very few parameters ( < 20 for all LR models in this paper ) , the dataset is large ( > 2500 when using 2020 data alone ) , and we were not concerned about the overfitting issue . Nonetheless , we have now run Stukel \u2019 s test , a more recent goodness-of-fit test for logistic regression , and we have added this to the appendix . 6.The reproducibility study used a unique regression model for each year trained only on that year \u2019 s data . We did not recycle the 2020 AC model for use in other years . In the description of the Monte-Carlo method , we used the year 2020 as an example , but we did not mean to imply that 2020 was used for every year . Thanks for pointing out this weakness in the presentation ; we have now clarified this in our current version ."}], "0": {"review_id": "Cn706AbJaKW-0", "review_text": "In this paper , the authors conduct an empirical study on major machine learning reviewing process .

Have you considered the change in number of papers and number of reviewers over the years ? 7 ) Page 4 , Sec 3.3 . Number of citation increases exponentially over time . simply dividing by time will punish papers published sooner . 8 ) Page 5 , figure 4 , could you add the papers that never before seen online too ? 9 ) Page 6 , paragraph 4 , is it 0.15 out of 10 ? seems a trivial amount . 10 ) Page 7 , reputation , Is this a correlation or causality ? It could be that papers from authors with better reputation did have an edge in quality . Remember ACs have access to the review notes and the paper themselves too . 11 ) Page 7 , second last paragraph . We ca n't mix woman % in the US with ICLR which is a global venue . Global % could be lower . 12 ) Page 8 Conclusion . This is a weak point , Conclusion is not supported by the content of the paper , but more like a speculation .", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Thank you for your insight . We address each of your comments below . 1.Some authors feel that papers may be rejected because they present competition for other authors , because of personal conflicts , or other reasons unrelated to paper \u201c quality. \u201d We agree that \u201c censorship \u201d is both vague and overly harsh , so we have changed it to \u201c a process orthogonal to meritocracy \u201d . 2.We are not suggesting that reviewers and ACs look up papers on arXiv specifically to find out the authors \u2019 genders , but any reviewer who knows the author list may coincidentally know the authors \u2019 genders . We would point out that there are many ways that the review process is not blind . It is fairly common for a reviewer to be assigned a paper that they are already familiar with from arXiv ( or a workshop venue ) , or from a talk that they \u2019 ve seen . Also , while this is officially prohibited by reviewing guidelines , we suspect that many reviewers search arXiv for papers regardless . That being said , we suspect that much of the difference in scores that we observe is the result of the well-documented \u201c achievement gap \u201d between men and women in the sciences ( the citations at the top of section 5.4 ) . Women tend to have smaller peer groups than men in computer science ( and in scientific fields at large ) that result in worse learning outcomes , lower productivity levels , or may prompt women to leave the field all together . This effect might be particularly strong at ICLR , where roughly 1 out of 10 first or last authors are male . 3.Thank you for pointing this out . We have clarified this in our current version . There are a total of 5569 papers over 4 years . ICLR 2020 had 2560 submissions , ICLR 2019 had 1565 , ICLR 2018 had 960 , and ICLR 2017 had 490 . 4.We agree that the variation in scores and AC decisions is useful . We think our results already contain this , and we agree that we should feature these numbers more prominently . The ANOVA measures the variation between reviewer scores when controlling for paper \u201c quality \u201d ( i.e. , the expected paper score ) . The ANOVA model finds that reviewer scores have a standard deviation of 1.72 , and this is reported in the main body of the paper . Quantifying randomness in the AC judgements is more complex , since AC judgements depend strongly on scores ; a low scoring paper will nearly always be rejected ( no significant variation in AC judgment ) , and a high scoring paper will always be accepted . Likewise , assuming a continuous model , there exists a paper score for which an AC will have a 50 % chance of accepting a paper , and so reporting the worst-case randomness is not particularly interesting . Rather , we address the problem in Figure 2 , where we show that if the number of reviewers is infinity ( i.e. , we completely remove the randomness in reviewer scores , and all randomness comes from the AC ) then the re-acceptance rate is 75 % . This means that , for an average accepted paper , a randomly chosen AC has a 75 % chance of agreeing that the paper should be accepted . We have now added figures depicting the reproducibility of rejections and of all papers overall . 5.It \u2019 s true that there are more sophisticated goodness of fit tests . We presented HL because it is the most standard method . HL \u2019 s main weakness is that it is vulnerable to overfitting . In our case , the model has very few parameters ( < 20 for all LR models in this paper ) , the dataset is large ( > 2500 when using 2020 data alone ) , and we were not concerned about the overfitting issue . Nonetheless , we have now run Stukel \u2019 s test , a more recent goodness-of-fit test for logistic regression , and we have added this to the appendix . 6.The reproducibility study used a unique regression model for each year trained only on that year \u2019 s data . We did not recycle the 2020 AC model for use in other years . In the description of the Monte-Carlo method , we used the year 2020 as an example , but we did not mean to imply that 2020 was used for every year . Thanks for pointing out this weakness in the presentation ; we have now clarified this in our current version ."}}
