They argue that the emergence of language requires co-operation . However , people can cheat and make a profit by lying , and eventually , people have no incentive to co-operate . A proxy multi-agent setting is created to study this which proceeds in a series of interaction between two ( randomly sampled ) agents . In each interaction , there is a market demand for N items , and both agents have a fixed quantity of these items and their own hidden utility . An agent makes a proposal to another agent for a set of goods which consists of quantities of each item that they are willing to give . The other agent has to fulfil the remaining quantity to match the market demand . The other agent can accept the proposal at which point both agents get reward based on the remaining items and their respective utilities . Otherwise , the bargaining will continue and the other agent will make a proposal . There is a timeout after which both get a reward of 0 . There are certain agents who are chosen as `` liars '' who can make a proposal but refused to follow through leading to the remaining market gap being split equally . Lying can , therefore , result in profit . A credit mechanism is also introduced to measure the performance of agents . Liars can use credit scores to decide whether to lie or not . A neural network is used to generate proposals and REINFORCE style training is performed to optimize reward . Authors also study `` natural selection '' where low-ranking agents get eliminated after a certain time , and `` genetic evolution '' where high-ranking agents produce clones . Three different settings are studied : ( i ) where there are no measures taken to stop liars , ( ii ) where each truth-teller can refuse to play with an agent with negative credit score , ( iii ) where global measures are taken including reward penalty for lying or liar agents being banned for a fixed time . It is found that in both ( i ) and ( ii ) ; liars take over society . Individual counter-measures slow down the proliferation of liars but do n't stop them . However , global measures in ( iii ) are able to stop liars . Authors argue that global measures in human society ( reciprocal altruism ) is the reason why conditions were right for language to evolve . * * Strength : * * - The setting is interesting . In general , understanding the dynamics of language evolution is a very interesting topic . This can shed light on human history , and maybe potentially be helpful for developing language understanding agents . * * Weakness : * * - The language part of the story is confusing since there is no language used in the experiments . In fact , what is really being asked here is if we can have a society without cooperation ? Since , if everyone ends up being a liar then we do n't have a society . Therefore , the language part feels like a red-herring . - Implications of the results are unclear as it is not obvious that the setup captures all the important nuances present in human society . E.g. , in a real-world , people who are speaking the truth can help each other by sharing technology that can give them a survivor edge over liars . This happens even if liars are not directly punished for their deeds . Then there is the question if the way natural selection and genetic evolution are modelled , reflect the real-world . I am not an expert on evolution but the paper does n't say enough to justify the choice . * * Questions : * * - In the case where agent `` i '' lies , the other agent will still end up paying its share of the accepted proposal plus 50 % of what agent `` i '' promised . Is this right ? - Can one pay more items than they possess ? If not , do we always have $ d_n \\ge q^i_n + q^j_n $ for every $ i $ and $ j $ , as otherwise there are not enough items to satisfy the market ? - In the setting of individual resistance , once an agent ends up with a negative credit score then the truth-tellers will refuse to play with them resulting in an addition of $ 1 - \\sqrt { e } < 0 $ to their credit score . So can an agent never increase their total reward once their credit score becomes negative ? Or , perhaps liars will still play with them and so there is a chance for their total reward to increase . - How would the behaviour be if the agent also had access to ( i ) total reward earned by the other agent , ( ii ) percentage of cases the other agent lied . E.g. , if an agent saw that the other agent lie then they are likely to either not play with them or demand a more lucrative offer before committing . This can allow for more interesting policies to evolve .", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "\\ > > > The language part of the story is confusing since there is no language used in the experiments .

We argue that the emergence of language is a process of continuous improvement , in other words , we have simpler communication protocol , such as transmitting a few symbols representing proposals , at the very early stage .

Transmittability , compositionality , learnability , grammatical and semantic categories , and many other properties make the human language unique among natural communication systems . However , human languages , like species , evolve over time . As a complex communication system , language should evolve from an immature communication system at an early stage . This is the period we want to investigate when na\u00efve communication protocol , not necessarily possessing the properties owned by language ( e.g.cryptophasia created by twins is not culturally transmitted ) , was just created and used by agents in a community . The main reason is that lying behavior should emerge once communication is feasible since some species ( e.g. , vervet monkey ) have proved to express lying behavior in their daily life . Thus , we disregard other factors , such as transmissibility , since these properties do not contradict the conclusion we obtained . As for neutral models , it is defined to indicate how languages can change at the level of linguistic variants ( Reali & Griffiths , 2011.Words as alleles : connecting language evolution with Bayesian learners to models of genetic drift ) . However , we are investigating the motivation of communication , which is the prerequisite of further evolution . As for motivation , we need to figure out whether communication can bring enough benefits since communication itself incurs additional resources . We are not investigating the distribution of word frequencies or the relationship between word frequencies and other factors . \\ > > > The claim that `` [ ... ] in order to ensure the survival advantage of many competitors , animals are selfish in nature '' flies in the face of the whole line of research on animal alarm calls . First of all , as illustrated in ( Zuberbuehler 2009 , `` Survivor Signals : The Biology and Psychology of Animal Alarm Calling '' ) , alarm call is beneficial to a signaler if it increases the reproductive success since receivers prefer individuals as mating partners that are more willing to produce risky alarm calls in the presence of predators . Also , alarm signal is possible to trigger a subsequent group effort to get rid of the predator , then this behavior is profitable since it decreases the vulnerability of the signaler . All in all , parts of hypotheses about the presence of alarm calls are based on the assumption it is beneficial to the signaler , not to others . Therefore , our argument indeed does not fly in the face of the whole line of research on animal alarm calls since animal may do it for its own survival . Moreover , the existence of social animals does not mean animals are selfless facing the conflict of interests . \\ > > > Is there a reason to use a discrete dynamic over a continuous one ? We use discrete symbols over continuous ones to communicate since it can be easily interpreted and analyzed . And most animals communicate with discrete signals . \\ > > > Why use a multi-round bargaining game to model language evolution by contrast to , say , an established signaling game-style setup with conflict of interests ? If we modify an established signaling game-style setup with conflict of interests , such as one \u2019 s goal is to signal others to a wrong direction and gain the reward , we do not see any motivation for the receiver to communicate in the first place . On the contrary , we have shown that agents can cooperate with a conflict of interest in the bargaining game . \\ > > > How is the `` credit mechanism '' and the `` market '' motivated/grounded in light of this being an investigation about language emergence ? In short , the credit mechanism means the agent begins to realize that others would also tell lies , which is one step in the evolution process . Because no consensus is reached in the community and there is no external authority , the individual has no choice but resists this behavior on its own . As for market , it is just used in the bargaining game for a better understanding of how the game works . The core idea is to design a non-cooperative game with conflict of interests . We believe the non-cooperative game is extremely common in real-world and can be a representative setting ."}, {"review_id": "Uqu9yHvqlRf-2", "review_text": "# Overall review This paper attempts to address a question in the emergent communication literature : what preserves / maintains the stability of emerged communication protocols . The authors manipulate the prevalence of lying behavior in a community of agents playing a variant of a Nash bargaining game . The main take-away is that explicit punishment , from the environment and from truth-tellers not wanting to communicate with liars , can prevent the spread of exploitative lying behavior in the community . My main worry about the paper is that the conceptual motivation is a bit unclear . The authors present the paper as addressing when emergent communication can be stable . And , after identifying a condition under which a penalty for lying removes liars from the population , they conclude that `` Only under such a environment , language is finally possible . '' But in all experiments , the communication protocol is fixed : mappings from market needs to proposals . In other words , what changes is less the communication protocol itself , and more the prevalence of lying / truth-telling . It thus is not clear how these results are to be interpreted as being about the emergence of communication itself , and not alternative uses of a pre-existing protocol . Pros : * Addresses a foundational question in emergent communication . * Explicitly models a community of agents , instead of just dyads . * Identifies explicit factors influencing their outcome of interest . Cons : * Conceptual motivation a bit unclear ( see above ) . * Communication protocol is fixed , not emergent . * Many interesting results / sub-experiments are presented as parentheticals / foot-notes , without full details in appendices . # Small comments * p 3 , choice to not do simultaneous proposals . More details about these experiments should probably be provided in an appendix . * Natural selection mechanism : the authors remove the lowest-performing single agent . This is relatively different from the standard interpretation , which is that the number of offspring in the next generation is proportional to an agent 's fitness . Did the authors experiment with that approach , or can they say more to motivate theirs ? * The y-axis in the main results are `` average scaled reward '' . How exactly is the scaling done ? This would help in interpreting the results , as would comparison with a random baseline and/or an optimal strategy . * `` As the natural selection approaches , there is less and less need to pretend for liars ... '' I had some difficulty following the reasoning here . Are the 10 tournaments _before_ a single episode of natural selection ? Or did natural selection occur in the middle ? If the former , it would help to know if these are averaged across `` generations '' in order to support the authors ' interpretation . # Minor typographic comments * abstract : `` From the perspective of Darwinian , ... '' needs to be finished after `` Darwinian '' . Same at the end of page 1 . * p 1 , `` some intrigue properties '' should be `` some intriguing properties '' * p 2 , `` lairs '' should be `` liars '' ; this one recurs a few times in the text . * p 8 , `` artificial intelligent '' should be `` artificial intelligence ''", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "\\ > > > My main worry about the paper is that the conceptual motivation is a bit unclear\u2026 Language is a structured system of communication . However , just as Rome was not built in a day , language evolved from na\u00efve communication . But lying behaviors emerge as long as communication is possible . As normally assumed , once a na\u00efve communication protocol has been created , it is more convenient and efficient for agents to cooperate and gain more profits , thus they have more intention and motivation to develop a more complex communication protocol . However , what if , at this stage , some agents happen to learn how to lie ? We have shown that , once lying behavior appears , liars would be dominant in the community , leading to less need and motivation for cooperation . In addition , the motivation for communication would also perish . Therefore , in our setting it is unnecessary to investigate the change of protocol itself , not to mention , existing na\u00efve communication protocol may also die out according to Lamarckism . In our settings , the na\u00efve communication protocol mentioned above is transmitting a few symbols representing proposals . \\ > > > choice to not do simultaneous proposals\u2026 Since first-mover has been mitigated by the strategy in ( Cao , ICLR 2018.EMERGENT COMMUNICATION THROUGH NEGOTIATION ) , there should be no difference between these two kinds of non-cooperative games . Moreover , empirically agents can not make use of communication to obtain extra profits in the simultaneous setting . In more detail , one party does not know what the other would offer , which incurs additional mistrust . Therefore , their proposal would be more conservative by giving an evenly dividing proposal . Then communication is useless since nothing valuable can be inferred . \\ > > > Natural selection mechanism In our setting , the number of offspring is not proportional to fitness , but it still follows the core principle . We deterministically remove the offspring of the weakest agent and add one more offspring for the strongest agent . The main purpose is to accelerate evolution . \\ > > > The y-axis in the main results are `` average scaled reward '' \u2026 The scaled reward is the rewards normalized by the maximum reward achievable for each agent , and scaled reward shows the relationship with the optimal strategy of each agent . We did experiments about random policy and the result shows it is around 0.5 , which is similar to the evenly dividing strategy . .\\ > > > `` As the natural selection approaches , there is less and less need to pretend for liars ... '' After 10 tournaments , natural selection happens . As natural selection approaches , it means they are retiring from the stage of history . Therefore , if the liar still has credits , it is desired to use them to get more profits before natural selection , otherwise , it would be wasteful ."}], "0": {"review_id": "Uqu9yHvqlRf-0", "review_text": "* * Summary : * * This paper studies multi-agent communication with an aim to mimic conditions for the emergence of language in society .

Transmittability , compositionality , learnability , grammatical and semantic categories , and many other properties make the human language unique among natural communication systems . However , human languages , like species , evolve over time . As a complex communication system , language should evolve from an immature communication system at an early stage . This is the period we want to investigate when na\u00efve communication protocol , not necessarily possessing the properties owned by language ( e.g.cryptophasia created by twins is not culturally transmitted ) , was just created and used by agents in a community . The main reason is that lying behavior should emerge once communication is feasible since some species ( e.g. , vervet monkey ) have proved to express lying behavior in their daily life . Thus , we disregard other factors , such as transmissibility , since these properties do not contradict the conclusion we obtained . As for neutral models , it is defined to indicate how languages can change at the level of linguistic variants ( Reali & Griffiths , 2011.Words as alleles : connecting language evolution with Bayesian learners to models of genetic drift ) . However , we are investigating the motivation of communication , which is the prerequisite of further evolution . As for motivation , we need to figure out whether communication can bring enough benefits since communication itself incurs additional resources . We are not investigating the distribution of word frequencies or the relationship between word frequencies and other factors . \\ > > > The claim that `` [ ... ] in order to ensure the survival advantage of many competitors , animals are selfish in nature '' flies in the face of the whole line of research on animal alarm calls . First of all , as illustrated in ( Zuberbuehler 2009 , `` Survivor Signals : The Biology and Psychology of Animal Alarm Calling '' ) , alarm call is beneficial to a signaler if it increases the reproductive success since receivers prefer individuals as mating partners that are more willing to produce risky alarm calls in the presence of predators . Also , alarm signal is possible to trigger a subsequent group effort to get rid of the predator , then this behavior is profitable since it decreases the vulnerability of the signaler . All in all , parts of hypotheses about the presence of alarm calls are based on the assumption it is beneficial to the signaler , not to others . Therefore , our argument indeed does not fly in the face of the whole line of research on animal alarm calls since animal may do it for its own survival . Moreover , the existence of social animals does not mean animals are selfless facing the conflict of interests . \\ > > > Is there a reason to use a discrete dynamic over a continuous one ? We use discrete symbols over continuous ones to communicate since it can be easily interpreted and analyzed . And most animals communicate with discrete signals . \\ > > > Why use a multi-round bargaining game to model language evolution by contrast to , say , an established signaling game-style setup with conflict of interests ? If we modify an established signaling game-style setup with conflict of interests , such as one \u2019 s goal is to signal others to a wrong direction and gain the reward , we do not see any motivation for the receiver to communicate in the first place . On the contrary , we have shown that agents can cooperate with a conflict of interest in the bargaining game . \\ > > > How is the `` credit mechanism '' and the `` market '' motivated/grounded in light of this being an investigation about language emergence ? In short , the credit mechanism means the agent begins to realize that others would also tell lies , which is one step in the evolution process . Because no consensus is reached in the community and there is no external authority , the individual has no choice but resists this behavior on its own . As for market , it is just used in the bargaining game for a better understanding of how the game works . The core idea is to design a non-cooperative game with conflict of interests . We believe the non-cooperative game is extremely common in real-world and can be a representative setting ."}, "2": {"review_id": "Uqu9yHvqlRf-2", "review_text": "# Overall review This paper attempts to address a question in the emergent communication literature : what preserves / maintains the stability of emerged communication protocols . The authors manipulate the prevalence of lying behavior in a community of agents playing a variant of a Nash bargaining game . The main take-away is that explicit punishment , from the environment and from truth-tellers not wanting to communicate with liars , can prevent the spread of exploitative lying behavior in the community . My main worry about the paper is that the conceptual motivation is a bit unclear . The authors present the paper as addressing when emergent communication can be stable . And , after identifying a condition under which a penalty for lying removes liars from the population , they conclude that `` Only under such a environment , language is finally possible . '' But in all experiments , the communication protocol is fixed : mappings from market needs to proposals . In other words , what changes is less the communication protocol itself , and more the prevalence of lying / truth-telling . It thus is not clear how these results are to be interpreted as being about the emergence of communication itself , and not alternative uses of a pre-existing protocol . Pros : * Addresses a foundational question in emergent communication . * Explicitly models a community of agents , instead of just dyads . * Identifies explicit factors influencing their outcome of interest . Cons : * Conceptual motivation a bit unclear ( see above ) . * Communication protocol is fixed , not emergent . * Many interesting results / sub-experiments are presented as parentheticals / foot-notes , without full details in appendices . # Small comments * p 3 , choice to not do simultaneous proposals . More details about these experiments should probably be provided in an appendix . * Natural selection mechanism : the authors remove the lowest-performing single agent . This is relatively different from the standard interpretation , which is that the number of offspring in the next generation is proportional to an agent 's fitness . Did the authors experiment with that approach , or can they say more to motivate theirs ? * The y-axis in the main results are `` average scaled reward '' . How exactly is the scaling done ? This would help in interpreting the results , as would comparison with a random baseline and/or an optimal strategy . * `` As the natural selection approaches , there is less and less need to pretend for liars ... '' I had some difficulty following the reasoning here . Are the 10 tournaments _before_ a single episode of natural selection ? Or did natural selection occur in the middle ? If the former , it would help to know if these are averaged across `` generations '' in order to support the authors ' interpretation . # Minor typographic comments * abstract : `` From the perspective of Darwinian , ... '' needs to be finished after `` Darwinian '' . Same at the end of page 1 . * p 1 , `` some intrigue properties '' should be `` some intriguing properties '' * p 2 , `` lairs '' should be `` liars '' ; this one recurs a few times in the text . * p 8 , `` artificial intelligent '' should be `` artificial intelligence ''", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "\\ > > > My main worry about the paper is that the conceptual motivation is a bit unclear\u2026 Language is a structured system of communication . However , just as Rome was not built in a day , language evolved from na\u00efve communication . But lying behaviors emerge as long as communication is possible . As normally assumed , once a na\u00efve communication protocol has been created , it is more convenient and efficient for agents to cooperate and gain more profits , thus they have more intention and motivation to develop a more complex communication protocol . However , what if , at this stage , some agents happen to learn how to lie ? We have shown that , once lying behavior appears , liars would be dominant in the community , leading to less need and motivation for cooperation . In addition , the motivation for communication would also perish . Therefore , in our setting it is unnecessary to investigate the change of protocol itself , not to mention , existing na\u00efve communication protocol may also die out according to Lamarckism . In our settings , the na\u00efve communication protocol mentioned above is transmitting a few symbols representing proposals . \\ > > > choice to not do simultaneous proposals\u2026 Since first-mover has been mitigated by the strategy in ( Cao , ICLR 2018.EMERGENT COMMUNICATION THROUGH NEGOTIATION ) , there should be no difference between these two kinds of non-cooperative games . Moreover , empirically agents can not make use of communication to obtain extra profits in the simultaneous setting . In more detail , one party does not know what the other would offer , which incurs additional mistrust . Therefore , their proposal would be more conservative by giving an evenly dividing proposal . Then communication is useless since nothing valuable can be inferred . \\ > > > Natural selection mechanism In our setting , the number of offspring is not proportional to fitness , but it still follows the core principle . We deterministically remove the offspring of the weakest agent and add one more offspring for the strongest agent . The main purpose is to accelerate evolution . \\ > > > The y-axis in the main results are `` average scaled reward '' \u2026 The scaled reward is the rewards normalized by the maximum reward achievable for each agent , and scaled reward shows the relationship with the optimal strategy of each agent . We did experiments about random policy and the result shows it is around 0.5 , which is similar to the evenly dividing strategy . .\\ > > > `` As the natural selection approaches , there is less and less need to pretend for liars ... '' After 10 tournaments , natural selection happens . As natural selection approaches , it means they are retiring from the stage of history . Therefore , if the liar still has credits , it is desired to use them to get more profits before natural selection , otherwise , it would be wasteful ."}}
