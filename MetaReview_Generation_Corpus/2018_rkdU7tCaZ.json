{"year": "2018", "forum": "rkdU7tCaZ", "title": "Dynamic Evaluation of Neural Sequence Models", "decision": "Reject", "meta_review": "The pros and cons of the paper are summarized below:\n\nPros:\n* The proposed tweaks to the dynamic evaluation of Mikolov et al. 2010 are somewhat effective, and when added on top of already-strong baseline models improve them substantially\n\nCons:\n* Novelty is limited. This is essentially a slightly better training scheme than the method proposed by Mikolov et al. 2010.\n* The fair comparison against Mikolov et al. 2010 is only shown in Table 1, where a perplexity of 78.6 turns to a perplexity of 73.5. This is a decent gain, but the great majority of this is achieved by switching the optimizer from SGD to an adaptive method, which as of 2018 is a somewhat limited contribution. The remainder of the tables in the paper do not compare with the method of Mikolov et al.\n* The paper title, abstract, and introduction do not mention previous work, and may give the false impression that this is the first paper to propose dynamic evaluation for neural sequence models, significantly overclaiming the paper's contribution and potentially misleading readers.\n\nAs a result, while I think that dynamic evaluation itself is useful, given the limited novelty of the proposed method and the lack of comparison to the real baseline (the simpler strategy of Mikolov et al.) in the majority of the experiments, I think this papers till falls short of the quality bar of ICLR.\n\nAlso, independent of this decision, a final note about perplexity as an evaluation measure to elaborate on the comments of reviewer 1. In general, perplexity is an evaluation measure that is useful for comparing language models of the same model class, but tends to not correlate well with model performance (e.g. ASR accuracy) across very different types of models. For example, see \"Evaluation Metrics for Language Models\" by Chen et al. 1998. The method of dynamic evaluation is similar to the cache-based language models that existed in 1998 in that it reinforces the model to choose similar vocabulary to that it's seen before. As you can see from this paper that the quality of perplexity of an evaluation measure falls when cache-based models are thrown into the mix, and one reason for this is that cache models, while helping perplexity greatly, tend to reinforce previous errors when errors do occur.", "reviews": [{"review_id": "rkdU7tCaZ-0", "review_text": "The authors provide an improved implementation of the idea of dynamic evaluation, where the update of the parameters used in the last time step proposed in (Mikolov et al. 2010) is replaced with a back-propagation through the last few time steps, and uses RMSprop rather than vanilla SGD. The method is applied to word level and character level language modeling where it yields some gains in perplexity. The algorithm also appears able to perform domain adaptation, in a setting where a character-level language model trained mostly on English manages to quickly adapt to a Spanish test set. While the general idea is not novel, the implementation choices matter, and the authors provide one which appears to work well with recently proposed models. The character level experiments on the multiplicative LSTM make the most convincing point, providing a significant improvement over already good results on medium size data sets. Figure 2 also makes a strong case for the method's suitability for applications where domain adaptation is important. The paper's weakest part is the word level language modeling section. Given the small size of the data sets considered, the results provided are of limited use, especially since the development set is used to fit the RMSprop hyper-parameters. How sensitive are the final results to this choice? Comparing dynamic evaluation to neural cache models is a good idea, given how both depend en medium-term history: (Grave et al. 2017) provide results on the larger text8 and wiki103, it would be useful to see results for dynamic evaluation at least on the former. An indication of the actual additional evaluation time for word-level, char-level and sparse char-level dynamic evaluation would also be welcome. Pros: - Good new implementation of an existing idea - Significant perplexity gains on character level language modeling - Good at domain adaptation Cons: - Memory requirements of the method - Word-level language modeling experiments need to be run on larger data sets (Edit: the authors did respond satisfactorily to the original concern about the size of the word-level data set)", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "reply_text": "Thanks for your review . This reviewer requested that we add a word-level experiment on a larger dataset , and we are pleased to say that we were able to include experiments on word-level text8 in section 7.2 of the updated paper . In summary , we achieved test perplexities of static eval : 87.5 , neural cache : 75.1 , dynamic eval : 70.3 .These results show that dynamic evaluation still provides a large improvement to word-level language modelling on a larger dataset .

Our result of 44.3 on the WikiText test set ( using WikiText-2 for training ) outperforms the static model on WikiText-103 from the neural cache paper ( Grave et al.2017 ) , which achieves a perplexity of 48.7 . Our result also approaches the performance of LSTM+neural cache on WikiText-103 from ( Grave et al.2017 ) , which achieved a perplexity of 40.8 . So despite using 50 times less data , our results on WikiText-2 are competitive with previous approaches trained on WikiText-103 .
