It makes connection from ResNet, FractalNet, DenseNet, and RevNet to different numerical solvers such as forward and backward Euler and Runge-Kunta. In addition, inspired by the Linear Multi-step methods (LM), the authors propose a novel LM-ResNet architecture in which the next residual block takes a linear combination of the previous two residual blocks\u2019 activations. They also propose a stochastic version of LM-ResNet that resembles Shake-shake regularization and stochastic depth. In both deterministic and stochastic cases, they show a positive improvement in classification accuracy on standard object classification benchmarks such as CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet. Pros - The intuition is good that connects differential equation and ResNet-like architecture, also explored in some of the related work. - Building upon the intuition, the author proposes a novel architecture based on a numerical ODE solver method. - Consistent improvement in accuracy is observed in both deterministic and stochastic cases. Cons - The title is a little bit misleading. \u201cBeyond Finite Layer Neural Networks\u201d sounds like the paper proposes some infinite layer neural networks but the paper only studies finite number of layers. - One thing that needs to be clarified is that, if the network is not targeted at solving certain ODEs, then why is the intuition from ODE matters? The paper does not motivate readers in this perspective. - Given the widespread use of ResNet in the vision community, the incremental improvement of 1% on ImageNet is less likely to push vision research to switch to a completely different architecture. Therefore, the potential impact of the this paper to vision community is probably limited. Conclusion - Based on the comments above, I think the paper is a good contribution which links ODE with Deep Networks and derivation is convincing. The proposed new architecture can be considered in future architecture designs.

Most of recent work like SENet , PolyNet , Inception-v4 , are focusing on the improvment of the residual block , which means improving the right-hand-side of the dynamics f ( u ) . We explore the other dimension , i.e.the ways to design shortcuts by bridging some of the existing designs of shortcuts with various temporal discretization of dynamic systems . Then we introduced a new micro-structure , called the LM-structure , which can be combined with exsiting designs of f ( u ) . For example , you could have LM-PolyNet , LM-Inception , etc . We take ResNet and ResNeXt as examples to show that the LM-structure can indeed improve accuracy and compress parameters over the original deep networks .
