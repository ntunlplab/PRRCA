The purpose is to understand the regime where the width and depth go to infinity together with a fixed ratio. The paper does not have a lot of numerical experiments to test the mathematical conclusions. In the discussion the reviewers concurred that the paper is interesting and has nice results but raised important points regarding the fact that only the diagonal elements are studied. This I think is the major limitation of this paper. Another issue raised was lack of experimental work validating the theory. Despite the limitations discussed above, overall I think this is an interesting and important area as it sheds light on how to move beyond the NTK regime. I also think studying this limit is very important to better understanding of neural network training. I recommend acceptance to ICLR.", "reviews": [{"review_id": "SJgndT4KwB-0", "review_text": "This paper studies the finite depth and width corrections to the neural tangent kernel (NTK) in fully-connected ReLU networks. It gives sharp upper and lower bounds on the variance of NTK(x, x), which reveals an exponential dependence on a quantity beta=d/n, where d is depth, and n is hidden width. This implies that when beta is bounded away from 0, NTK(x, x) is not deterministic at initialization. The paper further analyzes the change of NTK(x, x) after one step of SGD on a single datapoint x, and shows that the change also depends exponentially on beta. NTK has been a popular subject of theoretical study in deep learning, and it's an important question to understand when and to what extent NTK can capture the behavior of real neural networks. This paper makes partial progress by analyzing the diagonal entries of the NTK in fully-connected ReLU networks. It concludes that NTK(x, x) at initialization is not deterministic, and can change significantly after doing one SGD step on x, when beta is bounded away from 0. While it's nice that the authors obtained precise answers to these two questions, there are some drawbacks that limit the significance of this paper: 1. The entire paper only considers one single datapoint x, so it doesn't apply to the non-diagonal elements NTK(x, x') or the usual SGD with mini-batches containing multiple datapoints. Of course, it's already implied by the current paper that the NTK is not deterministic and can move a lot when beta is large, but it's unclear whether the reverse is true, i.e., what is the regime when the NTK becomes deterministic and frozen when an entire dataset is involved. An answer (even empirically) to this question would make the paper much more complete. 2. The result is also not so surprising given [Hanin, 2018] (and possibly some other papers by the same author) which also obtained a similar exp(beta) dependence using a similar combinatorial approach. 3. Minor issues regarding incorrect or missing references: -- \"Further, kernel method-based theorems show that even in this infinitely overparameterized regime neural networks will have non-vacuous guarantees on generalization (Wei et al., 2018).\" The result of Wei et al. is not about kernel method and in particular not NTK. -- \"In fact, empirically, networks with finite but large width trained with initially large learning rates often outperform NTK predictions at infinite width.\" The authors should refer to the work of [Arora et al., 2019] which AFAIK is the first paper that provides empirical study of the (convolutional) NTK predictor at infinite width on relatively large datasets like CIFAR-10.

However , this is certainly difficult theoretically and , we believe , non-trivial empirically ( see 1b,1c below ) . 1b.On the theory side , K ( x , x ' ) involves the joint distribution of activations and gradients at x and x ' . At infinite width such inter-layer correlations are probably obtainable , but finite width corrections appear to be challenging .

If our networks had depth and width 1000 , for instance , they would have on the order of $ 10^6 $ parameters . Moreover , since we are trying to simulate random variables that we believe have significant variance , we expect that any experiments would require sizeable computational resources . Such numerics are certainly possible and we would like to do them in the future . However , given we 'd ideally like to run a suite of such experiments , we leave them to a future empirical paper with the belief that the purely theoretical results we have obtained are meaningful on their own . Point # 2 : The reviewer is correct that the method employed here has a similar flavor that of [ Hanin 2018 ] in that we start with an sum-over-paths formula for the network function and its derivatives . However , there are substantial differences between the computations we carry out and previous results . 2a.Unlike prior work computing derivatives and activations in a fixed layer , the NTK involves significant inter-layer effects that require a more complicated analysis . ( This is why our work only computes the variance of the NTK , while previous work was able to compute higher moments in the relevant quantities . ) For instance the $ \\beta/n $ suppression of $ E [ \\Delta K ( x , x ) ] /E [ K ( x , x ) ] $ in Theorem 2 results from a delicate correlation between paths and is new . Further , since the NTK is a sum over all layers of similar ( but not identically distributed and not independent ) random variables , it is a priori unclear whether the log-normal behavior of each of them ( which could reasonably have been predicted from prior work ) persists or if the sum would has Gaussian fluctuations as a cursory application of the CLT suggests . 2b.The joint impact of the intermediate layers has another non-trivial effect on the final results . Namely , the prefactors in Theorems 1 , 2 reveal an intricate architecture-dependence that no prior work had predicted . 2c.The NTK also explicitly depends on the derivative of the network function w.r.t.network biases . Prior work on the input-output Jacobian in finite width ReLU nets did not need treat these random variables . Computing the interaction from weight-bias and bias-bias terms ( e.g.the expectation $ E [ ( \\partial N/\\partial b ) ( \\partial N/\\partial W ) ] $ in Proposition 4 ) is therefore novel . In summary , we believe that the computations here substantially extend previous results about the exponential exp ( beta ) dependence and were not definitely not obvious ( at least to us ) .

'' We agree that a major focus of [ Wei et . al.2018 ] is the salutary effect of regularization . But interesting results about generalization of NTK-type kernel methods are also given in Theorems 1.1 , 2.1 , which are the results we were referring to .
