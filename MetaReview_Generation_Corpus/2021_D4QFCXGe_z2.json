These two settings have a different number of network parameters . It could be the latter one has more parameters and hence takes a bit longer time to train . To provide a more thorough analysis , one should also compare to the following setting : * Convert each RGB image into grayscale , and stack the three grayscale images ( 3 channels as input ) , and then process them by an encoder that produces an output with 30 channels . While converting RGB images to grayscale lose some color information , such information should not affect the learning or final performance in the environments that the paper experimented with . Also , I wonder how the curves look after 0.2M or 0.3M steps as shown in Figure ( 6 , 7 , 8 ) . Could you provide the training curves for at least 1M training steps for the ablation study figure ( Figure 6 , 7 , 8 ) ? ( 2 ) How does the number of times steps ( in the paper , it is 3 ) in the observation input affect the learning ? An ablation on different stacking length will better demonstrate the importance and effect of having a history of observations . # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # * * Minor points * * : In Section 4.1 ( Page 4 ) , it should be Figure 6 rather than Figure 5 to support the claim that using a shared encoder gives better performance .

Thank you very much for your time and feedback !"}, {"review_id": "D4QFCXGe_z2-1", "review_text": "The paper proposes an alternative encoder architecture for an image-based deep RL agent that leverages attention . The authors suggest to compute attentional and non-attentional convolutional features , which later are combined together via a weighted ( learned ) residual connection . The designed architecture seems to improve performance of the agent on standard continuous control tasks from the DeepMind suite . Significance : The overall novelty and significance of the paper is low . While I appreciate the authors \u2019 drive to research alternative network architectures in deep RL , I \u2019 m unfortunately unable to find any significant insight either from a theoretical ( not studied ) or empirical ( the experimental setup is questionable ) perspectives . More details : Pros : + Interesting investigation into an architecture choice for a deep RL agent . I think this is an important direction to tackle and unfortunately there has been very little attention given to this problem . + Interesting ablation that demonstrates the learned attention map and what different features are responsible for . Cons : - The novelty , insight , and contribution are limited . Moreover , the empirical evidence provides inconclusive support for the proposed method . - Weak baselines . In Fig 2 performance of SAC : Pixels is weaker than in the literature ( See Fig 6a in https : //arxiv.org/pdf/1910.01741.pdf ) . In Fig 3 performance of DrQ is significantly weaker than reported in the original paper ( https : //arxiv.org/pdf/2004.13649.pdf ) and given that DrQ \u2019 s code is publicly available and more importantly fully reproducible ( personal experience ) , this casts doubt on the rigor and validity of conducted experiments . - This work goes against a common practice in RL and reports performance of their algorithm using only 3 random seeds . - There is very little information provided about the exact architecture of the attention block , I would appreciate more details here . - Absence of the source code makes me skeptical that the reported results are reproducible , given that the authors build on a publicly available code base ( SAC-AE : https : //github.com/denisyarats/pytorch_sac_ae ) . - The supervised setting experiment ( Sect 5.3 ) is also inconclusive since the authors compare train loss performance for each of the agents . Obviously agents that use data augmentation would overfit less and thus report higher loss on training dataset . Besides , it is not clear if the dataset for this experiment came from the agent with attention module or not . If so , this will also make learning harder for RAD as it has weaker affinity with the generated data . - The authors suggest that they don \u2019 t use data augmentation , but in Appendix B Table 1 they also suggest that random crops are being used .

Two-stream encodings and adaptive scaling of balance between non-attentional/attentional masks are major components of this module . The authors present empirical results of their algorithm and compares with SOTA baselines in deep mind control suite . # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Pros 1 . This paper is fairly well written and easy to follow . One of the main contributions of the attention module is two-stream encoding , where there are separate non-attentional features and attentional features extractor . Attentional features have more task-specific information , while non-attentional features have task-agnostic information . This attention module can be combined with any RL baseline algorithm , like SAC . The structure of attention module is simple and easy to understand . 2.R-Latte shows competitive performance in deepmind control suite . R-Latte performs much better than SAC+pixel , and almost achieves as good performance with SAC+state . When compared with SOTA algorithms ( DrQ and Dreamer ) , R-Latte shows comparable performance in many domains . 3.Visualization of attention module is helpful . As shown in Figure 5 , the attended output \\hat { x_f } ( green box ) captures relevant activated locations , and the agent can dynamically change the attention focus depending on each action . # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Cons & Questions Major 1 . Adaptive scaling of \\sigma : the \\sigma is an alternative parameter that should be tuned to balance between attentional and non-attentional features . I think the role of this parameter is consequential , but the paper lacks detailed description about this parameter . Could you plot how \\sigma changes over the course of training ? ( \\sigma is C-dimensional vector and initialized as zero , so you could plot the average of \\sigma over the course of training , and how it evolves over time . ) Considering that adaptive scaling of balance between two encoder is one of the two major contributions of this work , the paper lacks sufficient explanations on this part . 2.Need more justification for shared encoder for consecutive frames : one of the difference of this encoder from other conventional encoders is the use of shared-encoder p. The original algorithms stack the consecutive frames first , and then put them altogether into the encoder ; whereas in this work , each frame is encoded by p , and then stacked after the encoding . Although the difference between stack-first-baselines and your algorithm is shown in the ablation studies ( Figure 6 ) , I don \u2019 t see reasonable explanations on why this would benefit the performance . Do you have any intuition of why separate-encoding-then-stacking performs better ? To my knowledge , there is a reason in stacking consecutive frames first ( e.g.in DQN ) , because stacking consecutive frames contains its own information ( Mnih et al.2015 ) and separating them might break those information . Minor 3.The performance of R-Latte is comparable with SOTA ( Dreamer , DrQ ) , but doesn \u2019 t outperform them . In most case , R-Latte performs slightly worse than DrQ or Dreamer ; it \u2019 s totally fine , but I think you should change the phrase like \u201c significantly improve sample-efficiency and final performance of the agents \u201d . 4.Does your method show lower variances than SOTA baselines as mentioned in page 5 ? Only looking from the graph plots , I do n't see that . Could you support this claim with statistical/numerical values ? # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Typos & citation suggestions - In section 5.1. setup , I think you cited a wrong paper for Dreamer ; you cited Kostrikov et al.2020 for both Dreamer and DrQ . But you should fix it to Hafner et al.2018 for Dreamer . - Consider citing these works at the related work section and adding some discussions about them too : [ 1 ] Mott , A. ; Zoran , D. ; Chrzanowski , M. ; Wierstra , D , Rezende , D.

Considering that adaptive scaling of balance between two encoder is one of the two major contributions of this work , the paper lacks sufficient explanations on this part . We are adding a histogram of evolving sigma values to the appendix , and we observe that although initialized to be all zeros , the values at each index change into different non-zero ranges , suggesting different emphasis on each channel of the encoded features . We agree that the paper lacks more detailed explanation on the training of sigma values , and would like to investigate more on this for follow-up work . > 2.Need more justification for shared encoder for consecutive frames : one of the differences of this encoder from other conventional encoders is the use of shared-encoder p. We designed this encode-then-stack step with the intention to preserve the changes between each frame , so that the the two streams of attentional and non-attentional encoding can select from features at each time-step , and decide their own way to stack those features . We think that because all the later layers in both encoders use stacked encoding , our method is still similar to an all-stack encoding for the purpose of extracting information between time-steps -- as the ablation results suggest , stack-first encoding does not lead to a huge gap in performance . > 3.The performance of R-Latte is comparable with SOTA ( Dreamer , DrQ ) , but doesn \u2019 t outperform them .

Thank you for pointing this out . We intended to claim the significant gain over only the baseline results that do n't use other techniques ( the gray curves in Figure 2 ) , but the wording is perhaps misleading and we will fix it in the updated version . > 4.Does your method show lower variances than SOTA baselines as mentioned in page 5 ? Only looking from the graph plots , I do n't see that . Could you support this claim with statistical/numerical values ? The 'lower variance ' claim indeed calls for more justification and we 'd like to take that down until more experimental results come in . The SOTA results we compare to were averaged over more seeds and used larger batch sizes , and we are yet to establish a fair numerical comparison for now ."}], "0": {"review_id": "D4QFCXGe_z2-0", "review_text": "# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # * * Summary * * : This paper proposes to apply the soft attention mechanism in a CNN network to boost the learning speed of an RL agent in environments such as DeepMind Control Suite .

We 'd like to adapt to other environments like Atari for future work ; but for now , one thing to note is how our attention is very task specific , hence may be seen as `` supervised '' by task rewards , as compared to their `` discovered '' keypoints that requires some pre-training stage , while ours is trained end-to-end purely based on reward signal . > The paper compares to SAC with images as input . Such learning is typically slow . [ 7 ] shows that using an asymmetric actor and critic can significantly speed up the learning while requiring no state information at test time . How does the attention-based policy compare to this line of works ? Asymmetric actor-critic is indeed a promising direction for image-based control problems , but it has one downside that some form of state information should be obtainable -- hence we are more motivated to study purely pixel-based RL to generalize to more scenarios . We are not aware of any work that investigated asymmetric methods on these DMC suite tasks ; given the dense state-variables are indeed available on this simulated environment , we 'd expect a better performance than pixel-only approaches . The suggested ablations are also very on-point and we will make sure to consider for future work .

The authors suggest to compute attentional and non-attentional convolutional features , which later are combined together via a weighted ( learned ) residual connection .

Significance : The overall novelty and significance of the paper is low . While I appreciate the authors \u2019 drive to research alternative network architectures in deep RL , I \u2019 m unfortunately unable to find any significant insight either from a theoretical ( not studied ) or empirical ( the experimental setup is questionable ) perspectives . More details : Pros : + Interesting investigation into an architecture choice for a deep RL agent . I think this is an important direction to tackle and unfortunately there has been very little attention given to this problem . + Interesting ablation that demonstrates the learned attention map and what different features are responsible for . Cons : - The novelty , insight , and contribution are limited . Moreover , the empirical evidence provides inconclusive support for the proposed method . - Weak baselines . In Fig 2 performance of SAC : Pixels is weaker than in the literature ( See Fig 6a in https : //arxiv.org/pdf/1910.01741.pdf ) .

Obviously agents that use data augmentation would overfit less and thus report higher loss on training dataset . Besides , it is not clear if the dataset for this experiment came from the agent with attention module or not . If so , this will also make learning harder for RAD as it has weaker affinity with the generated data . - The authors suggest that they don \u2019 t use data augmentation , but in Appendix B Table 1 they also suggest that random crops are being used .

Two-stream encodings and adaptive scaling of balance between non-attentional/attentional masks are major components of this module . The authors present empirical results of their algorithm and compares with SOTA baselines in deep mind control suite . # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Pros 1 . This paper is fairly well written and easy to follow . One of the main contributions of the attention module is two-stream encoding , where there are separate non-attentional features and attentional features extractor . Attentional features have more task-specific information , while non-attentional features have task-agnostic information . This attention module can be combined with any RL baseline algorithm , like SAC . The structure of attention module is simple and easy to understand . 2.R-Latte shows competitive performance in deepmind control suite . R-Latte performs much better than SAC+pixel , and almost achieves as good performance with SAC+state . When compared with SOTA algorithms ( DrQ and Dreamer ) , R-Latte shows comparable performance in many domains . 3.Visualization of attention module is helpful . As shown in Figure 5 , the attended output \\hat { x_f } ( green box ) captures relevant activated locations , and the agent can dynamically change the attention focus depending on each action . # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Cons & Questions Major 1 . Adaptive scaling of \\sigma : the \\sigma is an alternative parameter that should be tuned to balance between attentional and non-attentional features . I think the role of this parameter is consequential , but the paper lacks detailed description about this parameter . Could you plot how \\sigma changes over the course of training ? ( \\sigma is C-dimensional vector and initialized as zero , so you could plot the average of \\sigma over the course of training , and how it evolves over time . ) Considering that adaptive scaling of balance between two encoder is one of the two major contributions of this work , the paper lacks sufficient explanations on this part . 2.Need more justification for shared encoder for consecutive frames : one of the difference of this encoder from other conventional encoders is the use of shared-encoder p. The original algorithms stack the consecutive frames first , and then put them altogether into the encoder ; whereas in this work , each frame is encoded by p , and then stacked after the encoding . Although the difference between stack-first-baselines and your algorithm is shown in the ablation studies ( Figure 6 ) , I don \u2019 t see reasonable explanations on why this would benefit the performance . Do you have any intuition of why separate-encoding-then-stacking performs better ? To my knowledge , there is a reason in stacking consecutive frames first ( e.g.in DQN ) , because stacking consecutive frames contains its own information ( Mnih et al.2015 ) and separating them might break those information . Minor 3.The performance of R-Latte is comparable with SOTA ( Dreamer , DrQ ) , but doesn \u2019 t outperform them . In most case , R-Latte performs slightly worse than DrQ or Dreamer ; it \u2019 s totally fine , but I think you should change the phrase like \u201c significantly improve sample-efficiency and final performance of the agents \u201d . 4.Does your method show lower variances than SOTA baselines as mentioned in page 5 ? Only looking from the graph plots , I do n't see that . Could you support this claim with statistical/numerical values ? # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Typos & citation suggestions - In section 5.1. setup , I think you cited a wrong paper for Dreamer ; you cited Kostrikov et al.2020 for both Dreamer and DrQ .

Considering that adaptive scaling of balance between two encoder is one of the two major contributions of this work , the paper lacks sufficient explanations on this part . We are adding a histogram of evolving sigma values to the appendix , and we observe that although initialized to be all zeros , the values at each index change into different non-zero ranges , suggesting different emphasis on each channel of the encoded features . We agree that the paper lacks more detailed explanation on the training of sigma values , and would like to investigate more on this for follow-up work . > 2.Need more justification for shared encoder for consecutive frames : one of the differences of this encoder from other conventional encoders is the use of shared-encoder p. We designed this encode-then-stack step with the intention to preserve the changes between each frame , so that the the two streams of attentional and non-attentional encoding can select from features at each time-step , and decide their own way to stack those features . We think that because all the later layers in both encoders use stacked encoding , our method is still similar to an all-stack encoding for the purpose of extracting information between time-steps -- as the ablation results suggest , stack-first encoding does not lead to a huge gap in performance . > 3.The performance of R-Latte is comparable with SOTA ( Dreamer , DrQ ) , but doesn \u2019 t outperform them .

Thank you for pointing this out . We intended to claim the significant gain over only the baseline results that do n't use other techniques ( the gray curves in Figure 2 ) , but the wording is perhaps misleading and we will fix it in the updated version . > 4.Does your method show lower variances than SOTA baselines as mentioned in page 5 ?

The 'lower variance ' claim indeed calls for more justification and we 'd like to take that down until more experimental results come in . The SOTA results we compare to were averaged over more seeds and used larger batch sizes , and we are yet to establish a fair numerical comparison for now ."}}
