Q2 : MLDG is very relevant to the proposed method . It would be great if the author can discuss its difference with RGM in detail . The key difference between MLDG and RGM is the introduction of regret . MLDG requires the model to perform well on the meta-test domains after meta-update on the meta-train domains . This is similar to leave-one-out cross validation at the domain level . The regret term in RGM also requires the model to perform well on the meta-test domains , but it further requires it to be \u201c optimal \u201d . This introduces an additional term which forces the meta-test oracle predictor $ f_e $ to perform no better than meta-train predictor $ f_ { -e } $ . This also makes the RGM objective a mini-max game while MLDG is not . Q3 : In theoretical analysis , can authors add the discussion about $ \\phi_ * $ ? Now all the discussions are based on $ \\phi \\in \\Phi_ { IRM/RGM } $ . We suppose that $ \\phi_ * $ means an optimal solution of RGM .

Q1 : Are the experiment settings truly realistic ? In real-world settings , I do not think it is common to have training data with small molecules and test data with larger molecules . For the quantum chemistry dataset ( QM9 ) , prior work ( Chen et al. , 2019 , Tsubaki et al. , 2020 ) has proposed to measure model generalization by splitting the dataset via number of atoms . Molecular weight split has also been adopted by Feinberg et al . ( 2019 ) for medicinal chemistry . We initially followed their splitting methods in our experiments . Nevertheless , we agree that these two splitting methods are not perfect ways to measure domain generalization as the test molecules can be much bigger . The major challenge is that standard scaffold split degenerates to random split when most scaffold clusters contain only one molecule . Therefore , scaffold split fails to measure domain generalization . Given these observations , we propose a variant of scaffold split called scaffold complexity split . We define the complexity of a scaffold as the number of cycles in the scaffold graph . Specifically , we put a molecule in the test set if its scaffold has a high complexity and the training set if its scaffold complexity is low ( the scaffold is defined as the Murcko scaffold illustrated in Figure 1 ) . This forces the test scaffolds to be structurally different from the training scaffolds . As shown in Figure 5 , the molecular weight distribution of the training and test molecules are similar . We hope this serves as a more realistic evaluation . Q2 : In the case of stability prediction , the train/validation/test splits are not based on the topology . Not sure whether this dataset is appropriate to evaluate the proposed method . We have removed this dataset from the paper so that all evaluation setups are coherent . Q3 : What is the classification performance of the scaffold classifier ? Can you explain how SRGM provides performance improvement when superfamily classification accuracy is low ? If most scaffolds contain only a few examples , wouldn \u2019 t the training of the scaffold classifier be unstable and hurt the performance of SRGM ? The scaffold classification performance is listed in Table 2 ( right ) . On the molecule datasets , the scaffold classification accuracy is over 90 % . On the protein homology dataset , the superfamily classification accuracy is 33.5 % ( top-1 ) and 51.0 % ( top-10 ) . However , SRGM can still give performance improvement because during training , the gradient perturbation is computed based on the ground truth superfamily label . This teacher forcing step helps SRGM to be robust to superfamily variation despite the inaccurate superfamily classifier . Q4 : Can you show how random perturbations would affect the performance of the proposed method ? In Table 3 , we report the performance of SRGM under random perturbation on the QM9 dataset . Random perturbation performs significantly worse for most of the properties . Q5 : In protein modeling experiments , how did the authors generate sequence-length invariant protein embeddings ? We simply take the mean of all the protein sequence vectors . Our ERM baseline with average-pooling achieves the same performance as TAPE on the homology dataset . Q6 : Detailed explanations of each task . We have added the explanations of each task in section 4.1 as well as the number of homology labels in section 4.2 . Q7 : Can you provide a more concise definition of standard and structured environments ? An environment $ E_k $ is called categorical if $ k $ is an integer . $ E_k $ is structured if $ k $ is a structured object such as molecular scaffold .

The authors propose a new method , the regret minimization ( RGM ) algorithm , to handle such a problem . The method is inspired by invariant risk minimization ( IRM ) . It regulates the empirical loss with the regret regularizer . Such a regularizer encourages the model to generalize to a new unseen environment . The authors further extend the RGM to the structured inputs , leading to structured RGM ( SRGM ) , which can be trained using gradient perturbation . Overall , the manuscript is interesting , which may be suitable for the general audience of ICLR . Pro : 1.Interesting problem and a new self-contained solution . 2.Promising performance across different tasks from different domains . 3.The manuscript is easy to follow although I believe it could be improved further . Concerns : 1 . The authors should further proofread the manuscript . I guess on page 5 , the authors wanted to say that `` the model would not see any change from one example to another as scaffold variation '' , right ? Some symbols in the paper are not defined as well . For example , in Figure 2 , I did not find the definition for $ B_i $ , $ B_j $ , and $ B_e $ . I am willing to increase the score if the manuscript is refined further . 2.On page 6 , my feeling is that the model is not very difficult to train . Are there any tricks to train such a model ? Is it similar to adversarial training ? 3.In Table 2 , why we have both RGM and SRGM ? What 's the difference between the two methods within this table ? If I understand correctly , all the inputs are structured , right ? 4.In Figure 4 , wow much would SRGM decrease for the different number of atoms ? I mean the absolute value , not the relative value to ERM . 5.For the HOMO , the authors include data from different protein families . How can the method generalize across different families ? 6.Regarding the feature extractor $ \\phi $ , how would the model complexity affect the performance of the proposed method ? Any suggestions on the selection of the parametric family ?", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Q1 : The authors should further proofread the manuscript . Some notations are undefined . We apologize for the confusion . On page 5 , what we wanted to say is that when an environment has only one molecule , the model can not decide which subgraph of that molecule is the right scaffold . Therefore , creating single-example environments is not helpful for domain generalization . We have updated this paragraph in the paper . In Figure 2 , $ B_i , B_j , B_e $ are three mini-batches sampled from environments $ E_i , E_j , E_e $ . To make the flow better , we have split Figure 2 into two figures . RGM backward pass is now illustrated in Figure 4 in page 6 so that it is coupled with the optimization section ( sec 3.3 ) . We have also refined the method section and resolved all the undefined notations . Q2 : RGM seems difficult to train . Are there any tricks to train this model ? Is it similar to adversarial training ? Training RGM is not difficult . The only \u201c trick \u201d we adopted is the gradient reversal layer between the oracle predictor $ f_e $ and the feature extractor $ \\phi $ . This is important because they optimize the loss $ \\mathcal { L } ^e ( f_e \\circ \\phi ) $ in different directions . This allows us to update all the players in a single forward-backward pass , just like domain adversarial training ( Ganin et al. , 2016 ) . Q3 : In Table 2 , why do we have both RGM and SRGM ? What 's the difference between the two methods within this table ? Each environment $ E $ is composed of a set of molecules and associated with a structure label ( i.e. , scaffold ) . RGM does not utilize the structure of the environment and simply treats an environment as a set of molecules . SRGM uses the scaffold graph to make perturbation in the representation $ \\phi $ . In other words , SRGM utilizes extra structural information and has the advantage over RGM . We thus provided the result for both RGM and SRGM . Q4 : In Figure 4 , how much would SRGM decrease for the different number of atoms ? The result is reported in Table 7 in the appendix . The absolute MAE difference varies for different properties . For instance , U0 goes from 51.3 to 23.9 when the number of atoms in the training set increases from 7 to 8 . Q5 : For the homology task , the authors include data from different protein families . How can the method generalize across different families ? SRGM learns to generalize across different protein superfamilies through perturbation from the superfamily classifier . Each protein is assigned to a superfamily and the superfamily classifier learns to predict its superfamily from its protein sequence . Q6 : Regarding the feature extractor , how would the model complexity of $ \\phi $ affect the performance of the proposed method ? To study how the model complexity of $ \\phi $ affects the performance of SRGM , we train SRGM under different numbers of graph convolutional layers on the QM9 dataset . As shown in Table 4 , SRGM performs the best when there are three graph convolutional layers . Similar to standard ERM , SRGM underfits the data when the model is too simple ( layer=2 ) and overfits when the model is too complex ( layer=4 ) . For the protein homology dataset , the feature extractor is a pre-trained BERT with fixed architecture and thus we can not run ablation studies for it ."}, {"review_id": "JywMsiz_NtO-3", "review_text": "Summary : This work is built on top of IRM , aiming to solve an issue in the biomedical domain where there are very few instances in a given environment .

The closest method to RGM is IRM . There are two key differences between RGM and IRM . We replace the IRM simultaneous optimality constraint by regret . This is important for over-parameterized models which can easily achieve zero training error . If an ERM optimal solution achieves zero training error , it will be simultaneously optimal in all training environments and thus also an IRM optimal solution . RGM avoids this problem because $ f_ { -e } $ is not trained on held-out domains and therefore does not achieve zero error . IRM simplifies the simultaneous optimality constraint to a gradient penalty term , which forces the predictor to be a constant function . In contrast , RGM is formulated as a multiplayer game , which allows the predictor to be non-linear neural networks . The difference between SRGM and CrossGrad lies in the way perturbation is used . In CrossGrad , the model is trained to minimize its error on the perturbed examples . In SRGM , the model is trained to minimize its predictive regret on the perturbed examples ( i.e. , how well it can generalize after unseen perturbation ) . This forces the model to be optimal in the environment of perturbed examples , which is a stronger constraint than CrossGrad . Q2 : Performance of the scaffold classifier The performance of the scaffold classifier is reported in Table 2 . We report the scaffold classification accuracy for SRGM as well as its variants in the ablation studies . Overall , the scaffold classification accuracy is over 90 % in the molecule datasets .

We put a molecule in the test set if its scaffold has a high complexity and the training set if its scaffold complexity is low .

The major challenge is that standard scaffold split degenerates to random split when most scaffold clusters contain only one molecule . Therefore , scaffold split fails to measure domain generalization . Given these observations , we propose a variant of scaffold split called scaffold complexity split . We define the complexity of a scaffold as the number of cycles in the scaffold graph . Specifically , we put a molecule in the test set if its scaffold has a high complexity and the training set if its scaffold complexity is low ( the scaffold is defined as the Murcko scaffold illustrated in Figure 1 ) . This forces the test scaffolds to be structurally different from the training scaffolds . As shown in Figure 5 , the molecular weight distribution of the training and test molecules are similar . We hope this serves as a more realistic evaluation . Q2 : In the case of stability prediction , the train/validation/test splits are not based on the topology . Not sure whether this dataset is appropriate to evaluate the proposed method . We have removed this dataset from the paper so that all evaluation setups are coherent . Q3 : What is the classification performance of the scaffold classifier ? Can you explain how SRGM provides performance improvement when superfamily classification accuracy is low ? If most scaffolds contain only a few examples , wouldn \u2019 t the training of the scaffold classifier be unstable and hurt the performance of SRGM ? The scaffold classification performance is listed in Table 2 ( right ) . On the molecule datasets , the scaffold classification accuracy is over 90 % . On the protein homology dataset , the superfamily classification accuracy is 33.5 % ( top-1 ) and 51.0 % ( top-10 ) . However , SRGM can still give performance improvement because during training , the gradient perturbation is computed based on the ground truth superfamily label . This teacher forcing step helps SRGM to be robust to superfamily variation despite the inaccurate superfamily classifier . Q4 : Can you show how random perturbations would affect the performance of the proposed method ? In Table 3 , we report the performance of SRGM under random perturbation on the QM9 dataset . Random perturbation performs significantly worse for most of the properties . Q5 : In protein modeling experiments , how did the authors generate sequence-length invariant protein embeddings ? We simply take the mean of all the protein sequence vectors . Our ERM baseline with average-pooling achieves the same performance as TAPE on the homology dataset . Q6 : Detailed explanations of each task . We have added the explanations of each task in section 4.1 as well as the number of homology labels in section 4.2 . Q7 : Can you provide a more concise definition of standard and structured environments ? An environment $ E_k $ is called categorical if $ k $ is an integer . $ E_k $ is structured if $ k $ is a structured object such as molecular scaffold .

The authors propose a new method , the regret minimization ( RGM ) algorithm , to handle such a problem . The method is inspired by invariant risk minimization ( IRM ) . It regulates the empirical loss with the regret regularizer . Such a regularizer encourages the model to generalize to a new unseen environment . The authors further extend the RGM to the structured inputs , leading to structured RGM ( SRGM ) , which can be trained using gradient perturbation . Overall , the manuscript is interesting , which may be suitable for the general audience of ICLR . Pro : 1.Interesting problem and a new self-contained solution . 2.Promising performance across different tasks from different domains . 3.The manuscript is easy to follow although I believe it could be improved further . Concerns : 1 . The authors should further proofread the manuscript . I guess on page 5 , the authors wanted to say that `` the model would not see any change from one example to another as scaffold variation '' , right ? Some symbols in the paper are not defined as well . For example , in Figure 2 , I did not find the definition for $ B_i $ , $ B_j $ , and $ B_e $ . I am willing to increase the score if the manuscript is refined further . 2.On page 6 , my feeling is that the model is not very difficult to train . Are there any tricks to train such a model ? Is it similar to adversarial training ? 3.In Table 2 , why we have both RGM and SRGM ? What 's the difference between the two methods within this table ? If I understand correctly , all the inputs are structured , right ? 4.In Figure 4 , wow much would SRGM decrease for the different number of atoms ? I mean the absolute value , not the relative value to ERM . 5.For the HOMO , the authors include data from different protein families . How can the method generalize across different families ? 6.Regarding the feature extractor $ \\phi $ , how would the model complexity affect the performance of the proposed method ? Any suggestions on the selection of the parametric family ?", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Q1 : The authors should further proofread the manuscript . Some notations are undefined . We apologize for the confusion . On page 5 , what we wanted to say is that when an environment has only one molecule , the model can not decide which subgraph of that molecule is the right scaffold . Therefore , creating single-example environments is not helpful for domain generalization . We have updated this paragraph in the paper . In Figure 2 , $ B_i , B_j , B_e $ are three mini-batches sampled from environments $ E_i , E_j , E_e $ . To make the flow better , we have split Figure 2 into two figures . RGM backward pass is now illustrated in Figure 4 in page 6 so that it is coupled with the optimization section ( sec 3.3 ) . We have also refined the method section and resolved all the undefined notations . Q2 : RGM seems difficult to train . Are there any tricks to train this model ? Is it similar to adversarial training ? Training RGM is not difficult . The only \u201c trick \u201d we adopted is the gradient reversal layer between the oracle predictor $ f_e $ and the feature extractor $ \\phi $ . This is important because they optimize the loss $ \\mathcal { L } ^e ( f_e \\circ \\phi ) $ in different directions . This allows us to update all the players in a single forward-backward pass , just like domain adversarial training ( Ganin et al. , 2016 ) . Q3 : In Table 2 , why do we have both RGM and SRGM ? What 's the difference between the two methods within this table ? Each environment $ E $ is composed of a set of molecules and associated with a structure label ( i.e. , scaffold ) . RGM does not utilize the structure of the environment and simply treats an environment as a set of molecules . SRGM uses the scaffold graph to make perturbation in the representation $ \\phi $ . In other words , SRGM utilizes extra structural information and has the advantage over RGM . We thus provided the result for both RGM and SRGM . Q4 : In Figure 4 , how much would SRGM decrease for the different number of atoms ? The result is reported in Table 7 in the appendix . The absolute MAE difference varies for different properties . For instance , U0 goes from 51.3 to 23.9 when the number of atoms in the training set increases from 7 to 8 . Q5 : For the homology task , the authors include data from different protein families . How can the method generalize across different families ? SRGM learns to generalize across different protein superfamilies through perturbation from the superfamily classifier . Each protein is assigned to a superfamily and the superfamily classifier learns to predict its superfamily from its protein sequence . Q6 : Regarding the feature extractor , how would the model complexity of $ \\phi $ affect the performance of the proposed method ? To study how the model complexity of $ \\phi $ affects the performance of SRGM , we train SRGM under different numbers of graph convolutional layers on the QM9 dataset . As shown in Table 4 , SRGM performs the best when there are three graph convolutional layers . Similar to standard ERM , SRGM underfits the data when the model is too simple ( layer=2 ) and overfits when the model is too complex ( layer=4 ) . For the protein homology dataset , the feature extractor is a pre-trained BERT with fixed architecture and thus we can not run ablation studies for it ."}, "3": {"review_id": "JywMsiz_NtO-3", "review_text": "Summary : This work is built on top of IRM , aiming to solve an issue in the biomedical domain where there are very few instances in a given environment .

Understandable this is likely to accommodate the page limits but is causing some confusion .", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Q1 : Both RGM and perturbation ( esp.compared to CrossGrad ) do not seem very novel . The closest method to RGM is IRM . There are two key differences between RGM and IRM . We replace the IRM simultaneous optimality constraint by regret . This is important for over-parameterized models which can easily achieve zero training error . If an ERM optimal solution achieves zero training error , it will be simultaneously optimal in all training environments and thus also an IRM optimal solution . RGM avoids this problem because $ f_ { -e } $ is not trained on held-out domains and therefore does not achieve zero error . IRM simplifies the simultaneous optimality constraint to a gradient penalty term , which forces the predictor to be a constant function . In contrast , RGM is formulated as a multiplayer game , which allows the predictor to be non-linear neural networks . The difference between SRGM and CrossGrad lies in the way perturbation is used . In CrossGrad , the model is trained to minimize its error on the perturbed examples . In SRGM , the model is trained to minimize its predictive regret on the perturbed examples ( i.e. , how well it can generalize after unseen perturbation ) . This forces the model to be optimal in the environment of perturbed examples , which is a stronger constraint than CrossGrad . Q2 : Performance of the scaffold classifier The performance of the scaffold classifier is reported in Table 2 . We report the scaffold classification accuracy for SRGM as well as its variants in the ablation studies . Overall , the scaffold classification accuracy is over 90 % in the molecule datasets . Q3 : The data split based on atom numbers , scaffold molecule weight and # instances in a protein superfamily looks weird . Does this truly probe model generation ? Does a big molecule weight difference necessarily correspond to two very distinct scaffolds ? In response to other reviewer \u2019 s feedback , we have changed the molecular property prediction experiments in order to provide a more realistic evaluation of domain generalization . Specifically , we propose to split the dataset via scaffold complexity split . We define the complexity of a scaffold as the number of cycles in the scaffold graph . We put a molecule in the test set if its scaffold has a high complexity and the training set if its scaffold complexity is low . As a result , the training and test scaffolds are different ( see Figure 5 ) . Under this new evaluation setup , SRGM still outperforms other methods across all datasets . Q4 : Figures not in the correct order ( fig 2 ) . We have split Figure 2 into two figures . RGM backward pass is now illustrated in Figure 4 in page 6 so that it is coupled with the optimization section ( sec 3.3 ) . Now the figures are in order ."}}
