The dataset may be viewed as an alternative to ImageNet-C which uses a different set of corruptions. To derive this set of corruptions, the authors first develop a notion of similarity between two corruptions, and then propose an iterative algorithm to build a set of corruptions which, intuitively, is sufficient to cover the larger set of corruptions (i.e., enjoys *high coverage*), and assigns a similar importance to each such corruption (i.e., is *balanced*). Then, the authors argue that ImageNet-NOC is superior to ImageNet-C as it achieves a higher degree of balance and coverage.\n\nThe reviewers found this to be a borderline paper. The reviewers appreciated the introduced metric and agree that there is no point in evaluating on corruptions which are perfectly correlated. In addition, the systematic approach for generating a set of relevant corruptions is seen as a step in the right direction. The reviewers appreciated the author response and were engaged in the discussion. As it currently stands the reviewers are not convinced that the paper is ready for acceptance. To improve the manuscript the authors could extend Tables 3 and 4 with a wider range of models and investigate qualitative differences between models robust on one dataset, but not on the other. Furthermore, there should be a more detailed discussion of stability and computational properties of algorithm 1. In addition, the authors should provide strong arguments as to why is it not sufficient to add additional corruptions to ImageNet-C and compute a weighted score instead. The latter suggestion could lead to an iterative improvement of the current set of benchmarks and place more emphasis on the methodology. I suggest the authors to incorporate the reviewer's feedback and place more emphasis on the methodology around algorithm 1, rather then on introducing another dataset which is likely to be superseded as soon as we add a couple more corruptions in the mix.

Indeed there are some gaps between the CE scores that are low . But we notice that this occur when the standard model already has a low CE score . These gaps may be lower than the other gaps because it is harder to make an observable difference when the reference already has a relatively low CE score . > To make more apparent that the ImageNet-C corruptions are covered by ImageNet-NOC , we have carried out another experiment . We have computed all the overlapping scores between one ImageNet-C corruption and one ImageNet-NOC corruption ( the Figure 3 has been updated to show these scores ) . We observe that all the ImageNet-C corruptions , overlap with at least one ImageNet-NOC corruption . For instance , it appears that the * jpeg_compression * corruption overlaps with the * quantization * corruption . On the other hand , the * border * and * hue * corruptions are not covered by any of the ImageNet-C corruption . These results are consistent with the ones obtained in Table 1 and support the idea that a model robust to ImageNet-NOC should be fairly robust to ImageNet-C . This point is discussed in the Section 5.2 of the updated version of the manuscript . > When it comes to the proposed experiment , it is true that m_INOC is not as robust as m_IC to ImageNet-C : fitting completely ImageNet-NOC does not imply fitting completely ImageNet-C .

In Table 2.a , the average mCE score is 76 , but all the models trained with a data augmentation on noise has a mCE of 71 .

Interestingly , the experiments carried out in [ 1 ] ( Table 9 ) show that Adversarial Noise Training makes models particularly robust to noises .

It proposes two metrics : robustness score and overlapping score , and uses them to specify desirable characteristics of a robustness benchmark : coverage and balance . It specifies an algorithm for selecting a set of corruptions that optimize for these characteristics , and introduces a new benchmark ( ImageNet-NOC ) built using this algorithm and evaluates some models that performed well on ImageNet-C on ImageNet-NOC to see if they still perform well . Positives : * I think the authors are correct that some corruptions in ImageNet-C are correlated and therefore , using a simple mean over corruptions is going to bias towards models that improve on the correlated corruptions . * Results like Section 5.4 seem valuable , since they show that existing ImageNet-C results may not generalize to robustness to a broader set of corruptions . Concerns : * The ImageNet-C paper specifically says `` networks should not be trained on these images , '' for good reason , since training on them makes it too easy to optimize for the metric , but miss the overall goal . This paper specifically trains on it . Maybe it 's ok for this particular case of analyzing the benchmark itself , but that should be called out very clearly . The entire benchmark becomes useless if people start training on it . * There is an assumption made throughout the paper that using a corruption as data augmentation during training imparts robustness to that corruption on the trained model . This needs to be established . I have seen empirically that it is n't always the case . * I worry that Algorithm 1 is itself not robust to changes in architecture or training methodology . You do present results showing that the corruptions selected using ResNet18 also have low overlap when measured on DenseNet , but I would have also liked to see whether running Algorithm 1 with the same set of candidate corruptions , but using DenseNet , would result in the same set of corruptions being selected . * The claims in section 5.2 seem entirely misleading . The results you show are purely a result of the initial set of candidate corruptions you chose , and you provided no methodology for how to perform that step . If your initial set had been exactly ImageNet-C or even a subset of ImageNet-C then the results would have looked entirely different . Similarly , I could introduce a new corruption that is n't in your candidate set and suddenly ImageNet-NOC would look like it has low coverage . Given that the space of possible corruptions is unbounded , this notion of coverage does n't seem at all valuable to me . * On the whole , I think this paper would be a lot stronger if the proposal was just a set of weights for each ImageNet-C corruption , such that the top-line robustness metric used would be a weighted average that is less biased towards correlated corruptions . Minor details : * It 's kind of weird to have section 2.3 placed where it is . It would make more sense at the beginning of section 4 . * In section 3.1 , the statement that R_c^m \\in [ 0 , 1 ] is n't strictly true . It 's possible that A_c > A_clean . * It 's worth mentioning explicitly that the robustness score , as you 've defined it , is only valuable when presented along with A_clean . If A_c == A_clean because both are at chance , this has optimal robustness but is n't interesting . * R^standard is used in Eq 1 but it is n't defined until a few paragraphs later . * Algorithm 1 is very verbose and complicated-sounding . Steps 2-6 could just have been written as : `` Pick the largest subset with overlap score under the threshold and break ties by selecting the lowest overlap score . '' * There are a number of misspellings and grammatical issues throughout . Reasons for score : The critique of ImageNet-C is valid , but I do n't think the proposed solution really addresses it . A good solution needs to be totally agnostic to architecture and training algorithm , which this method is not . There also needs to be a lot less dependence on the manually selected list of initial corruption candidates . I think ImageNet-C made a conscious choice not to involve model training when building their benchmark dataset and they had good reasons for doing so . Those reasons ( laid out in the `` Concerns '' above ) are why I do n't think this paper is worthy of acceptance .", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "* \u201c The claims in section 5.2 seem entirely misleading .

The larger the initial set , the more combinations of non-overlapping corruptions can be found by the Algorithm 1 , the more it increases the chances to build a large benchmark for a given overlapping_threshold . Then , if we added corruptions in the initial set of candidates displayed in Figure 2 , it would make the Algorithm 1 build benchmarks that are larger i.e.that have a larger coverage . We have added information about the importance of the selection of the initial set of corruptions in Section 4 . We agree that if we had chosen a different initial set of corruptions , the results in Section 5.2 would have been different . But our point here is to show that with the set of candidates displayed in Figure 2 , the Algorithm 1 is already able to find benchmarks such as ImageNet-NOC , that are balanced and cover a large range of corruptions . * \u201c Similarly , I could introduce a new corruption that is n't in your candidate set and suddenly ImageNet-NOC would look like it has low coverage. \u201d * > We agree that you could select a corruption that is not covered by ImageNet-NOC . But we argue that it is hard to select a corruption that is not covered by ImageNet-NOC but covered by ImageNet-C. To support this statement , we propose to consider all the overlapping scores computed with one ImageNet-NOC corruption and one ImageNet-C corruption ( Figure 3 has been updated in the manuscript to display these scores ) . It appears that all the ImageNet-C corruptions overlap with at least one ImageNet-NOC corruption . Then , an introduced corruption that overlaps with the ImageNet-C corruptions is likely to also overlap with the ImageNet-NOC corruptions . In other words , a corruption that is covered by ImageNet-C is likely to be also covered by ImageNet-NOC . This mean that it would be difficult to find a corruption that is not covered by ImageNet-NOC but covered by ImageNet-C. On the other hand , ImageNet-NOC does contain corruptions that are not covered by ImageNet-C and that is why we think that ImageNet-NOC has a larger coverage than ImageNet-C. * \u201c Given that the space of possible corruptions is unbounded , this notion of coverage does n't seem at all valuable to me. \u201d * > To make the value of the notion of coverage more apparent , we propose to proceed to an additional experiment . We have computed the CE score of the m_IC model and the standard model to the * obstruction * and the * gray_scale * corruptions ( described in Figure 5 and 6 ) . The m_IC and standard models respectively have an * obstruction * CE score of 135 and 112 and a * gray_scale * CE score of 86 and 76 . In other words , being robust to ImageNet-C does not imply being robust to these corruptions . This result is not surprising because we show in Section 5.2 that being robust to ImageNet-C does not imply being robust to the * hue * and * border * corruptions , and we see in Appendix A that * hue * and * border * respectively overlap with * color_distortion * and * obstruction * . Then , knowing that a corruption ( such as * hue * ) is not covered by a benchmark , does not simply mean that this benchmark does not provide a robustness guarantee only on this single corruption among the unbounded space of corruption . It means that this benchmark does not provide any robustness guarantee on a subset of the space of possible corruptions . For instance in our example , it seems that ImageNet-C does not provide any guarantee on the robustness to the corruptions that distort the colors in images . Then , we think that the coverage has a practical value : a corruption that is not covered by a benchmark , implies that this benchmark gives no information about the robustness towards a subset of the unbounded space of possible corruptions . * \u201c On the whole , I think this paper would be a lot stronger if the proposal was just a set of weights for each ImageNet-C corruption , such that the top-line robustness metric used would be a weighted average that is less biased towards correlated corruptions. \u201d * > We disagree with this statement because it would not solve the problem that ImageNet-C does not cover some aspects of the common corruption robustness . We demonstrated in Section 5.2 that ImageNet-C does not cover the * hue * and * border * corruptions and we also show in the answer to the last concern , that the * gray_scale * and * obstruction * corruptions are not covered by ImageNet-C either . A set of weights for each ImageNet-C corruption would not help to cover more corruptions . We thank you for the valuable feedbacks made in the minor details .

Datasets of corrupted images , such as ImageNet-C , have been created for this purpose . However , these datasets have been created from an ad-hoc , heuristic selection of perturbations . The present paper proposes a systematic approach to select types of perturbations in a way that spans a large variety of perturbations and assigns similar importance to each perturbation . Similarity of perturbations is measured based on how much training on one perturbations confers robustness against another perturbation . The paper provides an algorithm for selecting perturbations to include , and uses the algorithm to create a variant of ImageNet-C with improved coverage and balance . # # Arguments for acceptance 1 . Robustness of computer vision models to image perturbations is a topic of great interest , but methods to measure robustness are either highly artificial ( adversarial robustness ) or ad hoc heuristics . The present paper takes an important step in the direction of making evaluation of robustness to non-adversarial corruptions more principled . 2.The paper is written clearly . 3.The overlapping score is based on a practically relevant quantity , namely the performance of a network on the corrupted data . 4.A simple algorithm is provided for selecting perturbations for new datasets . 5.A new alternative to ImageNet-C is created with the proposed algorithm . The new dataset has improved coverage and balance properties . Some evidence is provided that these improvements can affect the results of robustness evaluations . # # Arguments against acceptance 6 . The computational cost of the method is high , and not stated or discussed . As far as I can tell , at least one neural network needs to be trained for each candidate dataset . Although the authors state that results transfer across architectures , such that a small architecture can be used , it is known that robustness properties depend significantly on model size and training procedure ( e.g.see https : //arxiv.org/abs/2007.08558 ) . This should be addressed further . 7.This method only really works for synthetic corruptions for which many new examples can be generated . Otherwise , it may be difficult to obtain enough examples to train the network used for computing the overlapping score . 8.It is not discussed whether Algorithm 1 is guaranteed to provide the optimal combination of datasets ( in terms of overlap and balance ) . 9.It is not entirely clear if the improvements provided by ImageNet-NOC make a significant difference in practice . Table 3 starts to address this question , but it would be useful to compare ImageNet-C and ImageNet-NOC mCE across a wider range of models ( e.g.pretrained models available online ) .

As far as I can tell , at least one neural network needs to be trained for each candidate dataset. \u201d * > Indeed , the computational cost of the method is high because it requires to train one model for each corruption in the initial set of corruptions . Training one ResNet18 for every corruption displayed in Figure 2 , took one week with a single GPU Nvidia Tesla V100 . We think that the computational cost of the method could be significantly reduced by fine-tuning models during a few epochs instead of training them from scratch . Unfortunately , we have not succeeded in verifying in time whether the results obtained with fine-tuning are significantly different from the ones obtained with complete trainings . We have added this information in the Section 4 of the updated manuscript . * \u201c Although the authors state that results transfer across architectures , such that a small architecture can be used , it is known that robustness properties depend significantly on model size and training procedure ( e.g.see https : //arxiv.org/abs/2007.08558 ) . This should be addressed further. \u201d * > We agree that the robustness of models is largely dependent on the model size and the training procedure . We also agree that if we had used a very small architecture , too small to fit the training data for instance , we would have obtained very different overlapping scores . However , we have computed the overlapping scores between all the ImageNet-NOC and ImageNet-C corruptions with the ResNet18 , DenseNet-121 and Wide-ResNet-50-2 architectures . The results obtained are displayed in Appendix D of the updated manuscript . It appears that even if these three models do not have the same size or structure , the obtained overlapping arrays are very similar . We think the reason we obtain these results is that the overlapping metric relates to the robustness gain of models due to a data augmentation rather than the robustness of models itself . So , the study of the corruption overlappings , may depend less on the architecture and on the training procedure of models than the robustness metrics . 7 ) > Indeed this is a constraint of our method . In this case , one option is to use a synthetic corruption as a substitute for the corruption for which we can not obtain many examples , and assume that this substitute overlaps with the corruption it replaces . We think it could be feasible because Hendrycks et al [ 1 ] showed that synthetic corruptions can help to deal with real-world distribution shifts . However , we are aware that this solution could be complicated and very time-consuming to implement in practice . 8 ) > For each benchmark b of n corruptions provided by Algorithm 1 , it is guaranteed that b is the n-corruption benchmark with the lowest mean overlapping score as possible . In other words , each n-corruption benchmark obtained with the Algorithm 1 , is the optimal benchmark in terms of overlapping among all the possible n-corruption benchmarks . When it comes to the balance , we have not established a direct link between the optimality in terms of overlapping and the optimality in terms of balance . So , we can not guarantee that Algorithm 1 provides optimal benchmarks in terms of balance . However , as argued in Section 3.3 , we think that minimizing the overlappings in benchmarks should maximize their balance , and we show empirically in Section 5.3 that a benchmark obtained with Algorithm1 , is clearly more balanced than one that is not optimal in terms of overlappings . We have added explanations in Section 4 to make this point clearer . 9 ) > We have provided more results and discussions in Section 5.4 to help to compare ImageNet-NOC with ImageNet-C . In particular , we have added in Table 4 the results obtained with * AugMix * and * DeepAugment * on ImageNet-NOC and ImageNet-C. We have also compared in Table 3 , the ImageNet-NOC mCE scores with the ImageNet-C ones using various pretrained torchvision models . We see in Table 4 that the robustness ranking established with ImageNet-NOC is not aligned with the one obtained with ImageNet-C . In Table 3 , it appears that the VGG-19 , ResNet-50 , and WideResNet-50-2 are much more robust to ImageNet-NOC than the AlexNet model , but they are less robust than AlexNet to ImageNet-C . These results confirm that using ImageNet-NOC instead of ImageNet-C makes a difference in practice .

Then , we have added these qualifications and rewritten the whole paragraph to answer this concern . That being said , we would like to provide more evidence that the overlapping score is in practice a good predictor .

Concerning the given example about adversarial training , we see in Figure 3 that the overlapping scores computed with either * fog * or * contrast * and any noise , are equal to zero . This is consistent with the fact that adversarial training can increase the robustness to noises while diminishing the robustness to fog and contrast . Likewise , the overlapping scores in Figure 3 predict that the robustnesses towards the corruptions that alter the high-frequency information of images ( * noises * , * blur * , * pixelate * , * jpeg compession * ) are correlated .

Indeed there are some gaps between the CE scores that are low . But we notice that this occur when the standard model already has a low CE score . These gaps may be lower than the other gaps because it is harder to make an observable difference when the reference already has a relatively low CE score . > To make more apparent that the ImageNet-C corruptions are covered by ImageNet-NOC , we have carried out another experiment . We have computed all the overlapping scores between one ImageNet-C corruption and one ImageNet-NOC corruption ( the Figure 3 has been updated to show these scores ) . We observe that all the ImageNet-C corruptions , overlap with at least one ImageNet-NOC corruption . For instance , it appears that the * jpeg_compression * corruption overlaps with the * quantization * corruption . On the other hand , the * border * and * hue * corruptions are not covered by any of the ImageNet-C corruption . These results are consistent with the ones obtained in Table 1 and support the idea that a model robust to ImageNet-NOC should be fairly robust to ImageNet-C .

Interestingly , the experiments carried out in [ 1 ] ( Table 9 ) show that Adversarial Noise Training makes models particularly robust to noises .

It proposes two metrics : robustness score and overlapping score , and uses them to specify desirable characteristics of a robustness benchmark : coverage and balance . It specifies an algorithm for selecting a set of corruptions that optimize for these characteristics , and introduces a new benchmark ( ImageNet-NOC ) built using this algorithm and evaluates some models that performed well on ImageNet-C on ImageNet-NOC to see if they still perform well . Positives : * I think the authors are correct that some corruptions in ImageNet-C are correlated and therefore , using a simple mean over corruptions is going to bias towards models that improve on the correlated corruptions . * Results like Section 5.4 seem valuable , since they show that existing ImageNet-C results may not generalize to robustness to a broader set of corruptions . Concerns : * The ImageNet-C paper specifically says `` networks should not be trained on these images , '' for good reason , since training on them makes it too easy to optimize for the metric , but miss the overall goal . This paper specifically trains on it . Maybe it 's ok for this particular case of analyzing the benchmark itself , but that should be called out very clearly . The entire benchmark becomes useless if people start training on it . * There is an assumption made throughout the paper that using a corruption as data augmentation during training imparts robustness to that corruption on the trained model . This needs to be established . I have seen empirically that it is n't always the case . * I worry that Algorithm 1 is itself not robust to changes in architecture or training methodology . You do present results showing that the corruptions selected using ResNet18 also have low overlap when measured on DenseNet , but I would have also liked to see whether running Algorithm 1 with the same set of candidate corruptions , but using DenseNet , would result in the same set of corruptions being selected . * The claims in section 5.2 seem entirely misleading . The results you show are purely a result of the initial set of candidate corruptions you chose , and you provided no methodology for how to perform that step . If your initial set had been exactly ImageNet-C or even a subset of ImageNet-C then the results would have looked entirely different . Similarly , I could introduce a new corruption that is n't in your candidate set and suddenly ImageNet-NOC would look like it has low coverage . Given that the space of possible corruptions is unbounded , this notion of coverage does n't seem at all valuable to me . * On the whole , I think this paper would be a lot stronger if the proposal was just a set of weights for each ImageNet-C corruption , such that the top-line robustness metric used would be a weighted average that is less biased towards correlated corruptions . Minor details : * It 's kind of weird to have section 2.3 placed where it is . It would make more sense at the beginning of section 4 . * In section 3.1 , the statement that R_c^m \\in [ 0 , 1 ] is n't strictly true . It 's possible that A_c > A_clean . * It 's worth mentioning explicitly that the robustness score , as you 've defined it , is only valuable when presented along with A_clean . If A_c == A_clean because both are at chance , this has optimal robustness but is n't interesting . * R^standard is used in Eq 1 but it is n't defined until a few paragraphs later . * Algorithm 1 is very verbose and complicated-sounding . Steps 2-6 could just have been written as : `` Pick the largest subset with overlap score under the threshold and break ties by selecting the lowest overlap score . '' * There are a number of misspellings and grammatical issues throughout . Reasons for score : The critique of ImageNet-C is valid , but I do n't think the proposed solution really addresses it . A good solution needs to be totally agnostic to architecture and training algorithm , which this method is not . There also needs to be a lot less dependence on the manually selected list of initial corruption candidates . I think ImageNet-C made a conscious choice not to involve model training when building their benchmark dataset and they had good reasons for doing so . Those reasons ( laid out in the `` Concerns '' above ) are why I do n't think this paper is worthy of acceptance .", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "* \u201c The claims in section 5.2 seem entirely misleading .

The larger the initial set , the more combinations of non-overlapping corruptions can be found by the Algorithm 1 , the more it increases the chances to build a large benchmark for a given overlapping_threshold . Then , if we added corruptions in the initial set of candidates displayed in Figure 2 , it would make the Algorithm 1 build benchmarks that are larger i.e.that have a larger coverage . We have added information about the importance of the selection of the initial set of corruptions in Section 4 . We agree that if we had chosen a different initial set of corruptions , the results in Section 5.2 would have been different . But our point here is to show that with the set of candidates displayed in Figure 2 , the Algorithm 1 is already able to find benchmarks such as ImageNet-NOC , that are balanced and cover a large range of corruptions . * \u201c Similarly , I could introduce a new corruption that is n't in your candidate set and suddenly ImageNet-NOC would look like it has low coverage. \u201d * > We agree that you could select a corruption that is not covered by ImageNet-NOC . But we argue that it is hard to select a corruption that is not covered by ImageNet-NOC but covered by ImageNet-C. To support this statement , we propose to consider all the overlapping scores computed with one ImageNet-NOC corruption and one ImageNet-C corruption ( Figure 3 has been updated in the manuscript to display these scores ) . It appears that all the ImageNet-C corruptions overlap with at least one ImageNet-NOC corruption . Then , an introduced corruption that overlaps with the ImageNet-C corruptions is likely to also overlap with the ImageNet-NOC corruptions . In other words , a corruption that is covered by ImageNet-C is likely to be also covered by ImageNet-NOC . This mean that it would be difficult to find a corruption that is not covered by ImageNet-NOC but covered by ImageNet-C. On the other hand , ImageNet-NOC does contain corruptions that are not covered by ImageNet-C and that is why we think that ImageNet-NOC has a larger coverage than ImageNet-C. * \u201c Given that the space of possible corruptions is unbounded , this notion of coverage does n't seem at all valuable to me. \u201d * > To make the value of the notion of coverage more apparent , we propose to proceed to an additional experiment . We have computed the CE score of the m_IC model and the standard model to the * obstruction * and the * gray_scale * corruptions ( described in Figure 5 and 6 ) . The m_IC and standard models respectively have an * obstruction * CE score of 135 and 112 and a * gray_scale * CE score of 86 and 76 . In other words , being robust to ImageNet-C does not imply being robust to these corruptions . This result is not surprising because we show in Section 5.2 that being robust to ImageNet-C does not imply being robust to the * hue * and * border * corruptions , and we see in Appendix A that * hue * and * border * respectively overlap with * color_distortion * and * obstruction * . Then , knowing that a corruption ( such as * hue * ) is not covered by a benchmark , does not simply mean that this benchmark does not provide a robustness guarantee only on this single corruption among the unbounded space of corruption . It means that this benchmark does not provide any robustness guarantee on a subset of the space of possible corruptions . For instance in our example , it seems that ImageNet-C does not provide any guarantee on the robustness to the corruptions that distort the colors in images . Then , we think that the coverage has a practical value : a corruption that is not covered by a benchmark , implies that this benchmark gives no information about the robustness towards a subset of the unbounded space of possible corruptions . * \u201c On the whole , I think this paper would be a lot stronger if the proposal was just a set of weights for each ImageNet-C corruption , such that the top-line robustness metric used would be a weighted average that is less biased towards correlated corruptions. \u201d * > We disagree with this statement because it would not solve the problem that ImageNet-C does not cover some aspects of the common corruption robustness . We demonstrated in Section 5.2 that ImageNet-C does not cover the * hue * and * border * corruptions and we also show in the answer to the last concern , that the * gray_scale * and * obstruction * corruptions are not covered by ImageNet-C either . A set of weights for each ImageNet-C corruption would not help to cover more corruptions . We thank you for the valuable feedbacks made in the minor details .

Datasets of corrupted images , such as ImageNet-C , have been created for this purpose . However , these datasets have been created from an ad-hoc , heuristic selection of perturbations . The present paper proposes a systematic approach to select types of perturbations in a way that spans a large variety of perturbations and assigns similar importance to each perturbation . Similarity of perturbations is measured based on how much training on one perturbations confers robustness against another perturbation . The paper provides an algorithm for selecting perturbations to include , and uses the algorithm to create a variant of ImageNet-C with improved coverage and balance . # # Arguments for acceptance 1 . Robustness of computer vision models to image perturbations is a topic of great interest , but methods to measure robustness are either highly artificial ( adversarial robustness ) or ad hoc heuristics . The present paper takes an important step in the direction of making evaluation of robustness to non-adversarial corruptions more principled . 2.The paper is written clearly . 3.The overlapping score is based on a practically relevant quantity , namely the performance of a network on the corrupted data . 4.A simple algorithm is provided for selecting perturbations for new datasets . 5.A new alternative to ImageNet-C is created with the proposed algorithm . The new dataset has improved coverage and balance properties . Some evidence is provided that these improvements can affect the results of robustness evaluations . # # Arguments against acceptance 6 . The computational cost of the method is high , and not stated or discussed . As far as I can tell , at least one neural network needs to be trained for each candidate dataset . Although the authors state that results transfer across architectures , such that a small architecture can be used , it is known that robustness properties depend significantly on model size and training procedure ( e.g.see https : //arxiv.org/abs/2007.08558 ) . This should be addressed further . 7.This method only really works for synthetic corruptions for which many new examples can be generated . Otherwise , it may be difficult to obtain enough examples to train the network used for computing the overlapping score . 8.It is not discussed whether Algorithm 1 is guaranteed to provide the optimal combination of datasets ( in terms of overlap and balance ) . 9.It is not entirely clear if the improvements provided by ImageNet-NOC make a significant difference in practice . Table 3 starts to address this question , but it would be useful to compare ImageNet-C and ImageNet-NOC mCE across a wider range of models ( e.g.pretrained models available online ) . What is the rank correlation between ImageNet-C and ImageNet-NOC mCE ? # # Conclusion and suggestions This is a borderline submission . Because of the principled approach to an important and topical problem , I tend towards accepting it . Suggestions for improvement : 10 .

As far as I can tell , at least one neural network needs to be trained for each candidate dataset. \u201d * > Indeed , the computational cost of the method is high because it requires to train one model for each corruption in the initial set of corruptions . Training one ResNet18 for every corruption displayed in Figure 2 , took one week with a single GPU Nvidia Tesla V100 . We think that the computational cost of the method could be significantly reduced by fine-tuning models during a few epochs instead of training them from scratch . Unfortunately , we have not succeeded in verifying in time whether the results obtained with fine-tuning are significantly different from the ones obtained with complete trainings . We have added this information in the Section 4 of the updated manuscript . * \u201c Although the authors state that results transfer across architectures , such that a small architecture can be used , it is known that robustness properties depend significantly on model size and training procedure ( e.g.see https : //arxiv.org/abs/2007.08558 ) . This should be addressed further. \u201d * > We agree that the robustness of models is largely dependent on the model size and the training procedure . We also agree that if we had used a very small architecture , too small to fit the training data for instance , we would have obtained very different overlapping scores . However , we have computed the overlapping scores between all the ImageNet-NOC and ImageNet-C corruptions with the ResNet18 , DenseNet-121 and Wide-ResNet-50-2 architectures . The results obtained are displayed in Appendix D of the updated manuscript . It appears that even if these three models do not have the same size or structure , the obtained overlapping arrays are very similar . We think the reason we obtain these results is that the overlapping metric relates to the robustness gain of models due to a data augmentation rather than the robustness of models itself . So , the study of the corruption overlappings , may depend less on the architecture and on the training procedure of models than the robustness metrics . 7 ) > Indeed this is a constraint of our method . In this case , one option is to use a synthetic corruption as a substitute for the corruption for which we can not obtain many examples , and assume that this substitute overlaps with the corruption it replaces . We think it could be feasible because Hendrycks et al [ 1 ] showed that synthetic corruptions can help to deal with real-world distribution shifts . However , we are aware that this solution could be complicated and very time-consuming to implement in practice . 8 ) > For each benchmark b of n corruptions provided by Algorithm 1 , it is guaranteed that b is the n-corruption benchmark with the lowest mean overlapping score as possible . In other words , each n-corruption benchmark obtained with the Algorithm 1 , is the optimal benchmark in terms of overlapping among all the possible n-corruption benchmarks . When it comes to the balance , we have not established a direct link between the optimality in terms of overlapping and the optimality in terms of balance . So , we can not guarantee that Algorithm 1 provides optimal benchmarks in terms of balance . However , as argued in Section 3.3 , we think that minimizing the overlappings in benchmarks should maximize their balance , and we show empirically in Section 5.3 that a benchmark obtained with Algorithm1 , is clearly more balanced than one that is not optimal in terms of overlappings . We have added explanations in Section 4 to make this point clearer . 9 ) > We have provided more results and discussions in Section 5.4 to help to compare ImageNet-NOC with ImageNet-C . In particular , we have added in Table 4 the results obtained with * AugMix * and * DeepAugment * on ImageNet-NOC and ImageNet-C. We have also compared in Table 3 , the ImageNet-NOC mCE scores with the ImageNet-C ones using various pretrained torchvision models . We see in Table 4 that the robustness ranking established with ImageNet-NOC is not aligned with the one obtained with ImageNet-C . In Table 3 , it appears that the VGG-19 , ResNet-50 , and WideResNet-50-2 are much more robust to ImageNet-NOC than the AlexNet model , but they are less robust than AlexNet to ImageNet-C . These results confirm that using ImageNet-NOC instead of ImageNet-C makes a difference in practice .

Then , we have added these qualifications and rewritten the whole paragraph to answer this concern . That being said , we would like to provide more evidence that the overlapping score is in practice a good predictor . In particular , an overlapping score that is equal to zero , predicts that the two corruptions used to compute it , are in practice not correlated or negatively correlated . Concerning the given example about adversarial training , we see in Figure 3 that the overlapping scores computed with either * fog * or * contrast * and any noise , are equal to zero . This is consistent with the fact that adversarial training can increase the robustness to noises while diminishing the robustness to fog and contrast . Likewise , the overlapping scores in Figure 3 predict that the robustnesses towards the corruptions that alter the high-frequency information of images ( * noises * , * blur * , * pixelate * , * jpeg compession * ) are correlated . Here again , the prediction is consistent with the conclusions made in [ 1 ] , that state that the robustnesses of neural networks towards the corruptions that degrade the high-frequency information in images are correlated . In general , we have observed that the overlapping score is often useful to predict if the robustnesses towards two corruptions are correlated in practice . * \u201c The bibtex for the citations are messed up . For example , we see `` ( Evgenia Rusak , 2020 ) '' instead of `` ( Rusak et al. , 2020 ) '' . Author ordering for papers in the bibtex is often scrambled , some are separated by commas , and some are not . In general this paper 's formatting is a little unrefined. \u201d * > Thank you for pointing out the errors in the citations . We have rectified these mistakes in the updated manuscript . * \u201c weight decay set to 10e-4. \u201d * > We have corrected this typo , thank you . * \u201c For instance , a benchmark that contains a motion blur corruption covers the defocus blur corruption , because the robustnesses [ sic ] towards these two corruptions are correlated ( Vasiljevic et al. , 2016 ) . '' Vasiljevic et al . ( https : //arxiv.org/pdf/1611.05760v1.pdf ) show the opposite . Fine-tuning on defocus blur did made models slightly worse on horizontal motion blur ( Figure 2 ) . \u201d * '' > We are sorry for this error . The blurs that are shown to overlap in the latest version of the paper ( https : //arxiv.org/pdf/1611.05760.pdf ) are the defocus blur and the camera shake blur ( not the motion blur ) .
