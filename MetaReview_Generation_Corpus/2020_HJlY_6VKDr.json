The authors train an ensemble of deep networks, and output a null label when the ensemble disagree. Success of adversarial attack is defined as the ensemble outputs an incorrect label that is not null. The authors experimentally show improved robustness to adversarial attack. The idea is itself new, but very similar ideas are well known in the literature, and it is difficult to conclude that the proposed approach is superior. Several examples are: Defense by majority vote with ensembles has appeared several times in the literature (e.g. Pang et al 2019). The pro is that this paper proposes a novel way to create an ensemble by applying random linear transformations and rescaling to the input. But it is not clear this is superior compared to existing methods. Randomized smoothing (Cohen et al, 2019) guarantees smoothness of the classifier (and thus robustness to perturbation attack under certain norms). Note that randomized smoothing provides certified guarantee against a stronger attack model (white box); it also guarantees the size of the margin (or buffer as the authors call it). The intuition of this paper is based on similar ideas so it seems necessary to at least compare with randomized smoothing. Outputting a null label is a major workhorse of adversarial defense. For example, previous work use a generative model to detect out of distribution samples; use a calibrated classifier to output null when low confidence. Because the idea is only mildly interesting, good experimental support becomes crucial. However, I think there are several short-comings with the experiments: The experiment contains only one (fairly old) attack method. Several recent alternatives such as SimBA (Guo et al 2019) can make the experiments more convincing. The architecture is no longer the same for the target model (which is an ensemble with an additional random transformations) and surrogate model. It is unclear if the improvement is simply because of the difference in architecture. The comparison to baselines seem unfair because it seems that the compared baselines do not have the option of outputting the null label. For example, a simple baseline of randomized smoothing + output the null label if the logit scores are below a threshold can make the story much stronger.

In Peng et al.2019 , the authors proposed a defense based on several classifiers . The good point of this defense is that it has high clean accuracy and has high robustness as shown in the paper . However , there are several components of the paper which are not completely clear . From these points it leads us to believe our defense is still a valid contribution . We list the points related to Peng et al.2019 below : = White-box attacks : it is not clear to use that from the text that how the authors develop white-box attacks . We assume that the authors may blindly applied the attacks in section 2 to their defense . Actually , the defense may be vulnerable if we build the white-box attack as follows : given component classifiers F1 ( x ) , .. , Fk ( x ) , we want to build an objective function which optimizes the noise over F1 ( x ) , ... , Fk ( x ) rather than F ( x ) = 1/k sum_ { i=1 } ^k Fi ( x ) . With this customized objective function for the attack , we may see that the efficiency of the defense may be reduced . = Black-box attacks : the authors did not perform Papernot 's black box attack and a pure black attack . For comparison , we focus on CIFAR-10 . First , they verified the transferability between their trained classifiers and from Figure 3 ( untargeted attacks ) , the transferability between them is still very high , i.e. , $ 60\\ % $ . This implies that the success rate of pure black box attacks may be around $ \\alpha = 60\\ % $ . Note that the noise is 0.05 which is much smaller in our case 0.1 for iterative FGSM . The considered black-box attack on our defense is much stronger , i.e. , mixture black-box attack with 10-iteration FGSM with the noise 0.1 . = In comparison to our work , their clean accuracy is very high in their defense $ 93.5 % $ ( Table 1 ) in this case , we can say that there is no drop in the clean accuracy , \\gamma = 0 . If we use our metric delta , then we will have delta = \\gamma + ( p-\\gamma ) * \\alpha = 0 + ( 93.5\\ % -0 ) * 60\\ % = 0.56 . This means that this defense is not good against black-box attacks . \u201c Randomized smoothing ( Cohen et al , 2019 ) guarantees smoothness \u2026. \u201d Answer : Indeed , we are not aware of this paper . We discuss an implementation of Cohen ( Cao and Gang 2017 ) in Appendix B . Regarding these comments about different possible defenses , they bring up good points for comparison . However , these comments misunderstand the fundamental goal of this paper . This paper is designed to provide the first truly secure black-box defense , not evaluate other defenses which did not fully experiment with black-box attacks in their defense . While other techniques may exist , many of them remain untested . e.g.the smoothness defense suggested by the reviewer was never tested with Papernot \u2019 s black-box attack . The goal of our paper is not comparison but creation , the creation of a secure defense with rigorous experimental evidence to back it up . \u201c Outputting a null label is a major workhorse of adversarial defense\u2026 \u201d Answer : In terms of the diversity of attacks we consider , C & W , FGSM and IFGSM in conjunction with Papernot \u2019 s black-box attack . To address specific points related to the attacks mentioned by the reviewer : SimBA ( Guo et al 2019 ) does not work with our defense because the attack requires the access to the Softmax layer of the classifier . However , this is prohibited in our defense . We did consider the C & W attack , but the performance of this attack is worse than iterative FGSM . Hence , we skipped this attack as mentioned in Section 4 - Experiment Section . \u201c The architecture is no longer the same for the target model ... \u201d Ans : Architecturally diversity does not create a secure defense ( it is necessary for our defense but not sufficient ) . This was shown in Papernot et al \u2019 s black-box attack paper where the synthetic model is different from the target model but the attack still works well . In addition we can see architectural diversity does not provide security by looking at different defense in figure 3 with very different architectures than the synthetic model . The security reason for our defense is given in Section 3 ( security argument ) . \u201c The comparison to baselines seem unfair ... \u201d Answer : According to our knowledge , there is no defense which produces null output because people do not want to sacrifice clean prediction accuracy for the security . The randomized smoothing with null label as you suggested is vulnerable as we explained in the related work ( Appendix B - ( Cao & Gong 2017 ) ) . If the x+\\delta deeply locates in a different region , then the defense should fail . One important point for your suggested idea is that it is not clear to choose a threshold for that defense .

Here are our detailed responses . This paper is fairly intuitive , but I am not sure about the fairness of the comparisons in the paper , and the level of rigor of the experiments . Ans : in our experiments , we implemented or studied many known defenses and black box attacks on them for a fair and rigorous comparison ( see Table 1 ) and appendix for related work and experiment . In experiment , we considered C & W attack and we found that it is not as good as FGSM . Hence , we skip the experiment for C & W . We also explained why zeroth order black box attack ( which is very similar to SimBA ) does not work for our defense . It means we did consider many common attacks for our defense . \u201c I think the conjecture that buffer zones are widened when the models are diverse deserve to be empirically tested .

The procedure c ( x ) = Ax + b will only linearly transform each column of the image , but not each row . This design choice feels rather ad hoc . Why did the authors settle on Ax + b in particular ? Why not xA + b ? Or AxC + b ? \u201d Answer : This is done mainly for technical implementation reasons . We make our input X 1D ( so that the A and b can be directly implemented as a linear non-learnable layer in a convolutional neural network ) . While other combinations are certainly possible , the goal of this paper is not to exhaustively explore every possible defense combination . Indeed , one could think of a multitude of different ways a transformation could be implemented within a network . For example , why do we put the transformation at the start instead of the middle of the network ? Why do we use a linear transformation instead of applying non-linear activations in addition to the linear matrix multiplication ? Why use one matrix A instead of multiple matrices ? While these types of questions are all valid , they actually don \u2019 t truly consider the aim of the paper . The goal of this paper is to provide at least ONE possible concrete secure defense that has strong experimental evidence to back up its security claims . As long as we have one work defense framework ( as given in this paper ) the open problem of securing neural networks against black-box style attacks is solved . Other extensions ( based on the working defense presented in this paper ) can be considered as future work . \u201c Regarding the fairness of the experiments , do the models that the authors compare against have the luxury of returning a \u201c Undecided \u201d label ?

I have a rather hard time believing that this is the first paper to try unanimous voting across an ensemble. \u201d Answer : To the best of our knowledge , there is no defense producing `` undecided '' ( or bottom ) label as in our design . The reason is very simple : people want to maintain high clean accuracy rather than sacrifice it for security .

I think one way to potentially characterize the buffer zone is by actually performing white-box attack experiments comparing : White-box attack vulnerability of unanimous voting vanilla models White-box attack vulnerability of unanimous voting \u201c diversified \u201d models I would also encourage the authors to think creatively about other ways to back up the the buffer zone claims put forth in the paper. \u201d Answer : While we agree with the author that more empirical evidence can be shown for our concept , the fact that increasing the number of networks ( equivalent in some sense to increasing the size of the buffer zone ) yields less successful adversarial samples that fool the defense ( as shown in every experiment we conducted ) , strongly validates our buffer zone claim . \u201c I am also a little puzzled with the authors \u2019 choice of the diversification procedure . The procedure c ( x ) = Ax + b will only linearly transform each column of the image , but not each row . This design choice feels rather ad hoc . Why did the authors settle on Ax + b in particular ? Why not xA + b ? Or AxC + b ? \u201d Answer : This is done mainly for technical implementation reasons . We make our input X 1D ( so that the A and b can be directly implemented as a linear non-learnable layer in a convolutional neural network ) . While other combinations are certainly possible , the goal of this paper is not to exhaustively explore every possible defense combination . Indeed , one could think of a multitude of different ways a transformation could be implemented within a network . For example , why do we put the transformation at the start instead of the middle of the network ? Why do we use a linear transformation instead of applying non-linear activations in addition to the linear matrix multiplication ? Why use one matrix A instead of multiple matrices ? While these types of questions are all valid , they actually don \u2019 t truly consider the aim of the paper . The goal of this paper is to provide at least ONE possible concrete secure defense that has strong experimental evidence to back up its security claims . As long as we have one work defense framework ( as given in this paper ) the open problem of securing neural networks against black-box style attacks is solved . Other extensions ( based on the working defense presented in this paper ) can be considered as future work . \u201c Regarding the fairness of the experiments , do the models that the authors compare against have the luxury of returning a \u201c Undecided \u201d label ? If not , then the problem formulation is fundamentally different , and I do not think the comparisons are necessarily fair . Are there any papers out there that also allow for an \u201c Undecided \u201d label ? If so , they should be the baselines that one compares against . I have a rather hard time believing that this is the first paper to try unanimous voting across an ensemble. \u201d Answer : To the best of our knowledge , there is no defense producing `` undecided '' ( or bottom ) label as in our design . The reason is very simple : people want to maintain high clean accuracy rather than sacrifice it for security . We develop the metric \\delta to show that many existing defenses with high clean prediction accuracy do not have any security as shown in Table 1 ."}}
