These skills can be used in a model-based planning (model-predictive control) with zero 'supervised' training data (for which the rewards are given), but using calls to the reward function to evaluate candidate sequences of skills and actions. The proposed approach is convincingly compared in several ways to both previous model-based approaches and model-free approaches. This is a very interesting approach, and although I can already think of ways to improve, it seems like an exciting step in the right direction to develop more autonomous and sample efficient learning systems. I suggest to rate this submission as 'accept'. Regarding the comparison to model-free RL: although it is true that no task-specific training is needed, a possibly large number of calls to the reward functions are needed during planning. It would be good to compare those numbers with the number of rewarded trajectories needed for the model-free approaches. My main concern with the proposed method is how it would scale when the state-space becomes substantially larger (than the 2 dimensions x and y used in the experiments). The reason I am concerned is that the proposed method uses brutal sampling to search for good trajectories in z-space and action-space. It looks like the curse of dimensionality will quickly make this approach unfeasible. Also, it would be nice to have the learning system discover the important dimensions in which to plan (the x and y in the experiments), rather than having to provide them by hand. A minor concern is the following: is it possible that the optimization could end up discovering a large number of highly predictable (and diverse) but useless skills? In the related work section, 1st paragraph, in the list of citations, it might be good to also include the work on maximizing mutual information between representation of the next state and representation of the skill (Thomas et al, arXiv:1802.09484). The definition of Delta (page 9) is strange: it is said that Delta should be minimized but Delta is defined as proportional to the rewards (which should be maximized). Maybe a sign is missing.

The algorithm works well even in the case of high-dimensional state and action spaces. Their contributions are in four aspects: (1)they propose an unsupervised RL framework for learning intermediate-level representations, i.e. skills, based on maximizing the mutual information between the future state and current skill given the current state. This procedure is well-motivated and the mathematics is easy to follow. (2)they reformulate model predictive control (MPC) in the latent skill space. (3)their method is compatible with the idea of continuous skill spaces, which seems to give rise to more diverse trajectories and hence offers greater utility. (4)their method yields low-variance behavior while maintaining enough diversity. It\u2019s an accept for me. On one hand, using model-free unsupervised RL methods to learn intermediate-level skills is not a new idea. on the other, approaching this problem via mutual information is, as far as I know, new to this field. Although, the novelty of this approach remains undecided, this method seems to work well enough compared to model-based, model-free and hierarchical RL methods. Their analysis from the perspectives of continuous skill space and skill variance also seem to hold. Nevertheless, the study would benefit from more comparison with other methods using intermediate-level primitives (apart from DIAYN). Moreover it would be interesting to show this method works in scenarios apart from locomotion. I wonder how well the approximation p(z|s) \\approx p(z) works in non-locomotion tasks. Otherwise, the authors should mention this method is somewhat limited to locomotion tasks in the main text.
