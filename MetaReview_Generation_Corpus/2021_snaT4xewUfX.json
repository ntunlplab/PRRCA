The reviewers highlight the novelty of the approach. Some of the concerns with regards to clarity have been addressed by the authors satisfactorily. \n\nHowever, an important issue of the approach is that of estimating model parameters, which the authors do not address explicitly by simply referring to that as the task of the modeller. I believe this is an important issue and, although some of the parameters can be estimated along with the neural network parameters, this has not been shown empirically. Along a similar vein, the paper only presents results on a single real dataset (the bike-sharing dataset), which questions the applicability of the approach and no other baseline method is presented. At the very least, the authors should have provided an objective evaluation to other doubly stochastic point process models, e.g. based on Gaussian processes, where modern stochastic variational inference algorithms have been presented. \n", "reviews": [{"review_id": "snaT4xewUfX-0", "review_text": "The paper under review proposes a variational inference procedure for a specific class of Cox processes whose intensity is derived from a stochastic differential equation . The methodology relies on a restriction of candidate solutions the the subset for which the drift depends on $ x_t $ , $ N_t $ and $ t $ ; the drift is then modelled with a neural network . By simulating from the candidate model , a sample average approximation of the ELBO is used to compute a stochastic gradient descent algorithm , optimize the bound and thus estimate non-parametrically the drift . The paper is clear and well written with original and significant contribution . The paper would benefit from clarifications about the following points : # # Major points * It is not clear how equation ( 13 ) is a subset of the solution of ( 2 ) in general more parameters implies more degree of freedom and thus the drift in ( 13 ) could look more general than $ b ( x ) $ ( the use the $ \\bar { b } $ notation suggesting it refers more to ( 11 ) than ( 2 ) ) . This probably comes from the fact that all variables are indexed by $ t $ but more details would be nice here . * The proposed framework requires to specify both $ b $ and $ \\sigma $ a priori .

Could the author ( s ) elaborate ( s ) on this point ?
