The intuition is that by training on a related but harder task, the network is forced to learn not just about sampled points but about the behavior in regions around the actual training examples. Their work shows that imposing these additional requirements on the model does result in better performance on unseen data, where only the label of the unseen data point is required as output. They show that learning more about the global {feature,label} distribution improves F1 scores, and suggest that their methods can be used as an example generator for datasets with class imbalance. The writing was clear. I had only 1 misunderstanding that cause me trouble, namely the first sentence of \"Classification\", where I might put the word 'benchmark' up front rather than at the end of this somewhat long sentence. By the time 'knn benchmark' appeared some paragraphs later, I realized I had missed something, and had to backtrack. Figs 1--3 are only viewable on screen with fairly extreme magnification. I found different viewers varied in legibility at these extreme zoom settings. However, when expanded so y-axis numbers could be deciphered, it turned out that actual improvements in F1 score were rather modest. For 4 datasets, their F1 scores of their best method, V2VSLS, improved by ~ 1.5 to 6%. They found that their methods were less affected by out-of-core computation than the benchmark kNN F1 scores. I did have some questions about the problem formulation. I did not really understand why the models wanted to reproduce the exact ordering of the nearest neighbors, other than this is easy to formulate. This makes sense for n.n. label sequences, where further points might be in some neighboring class. But for predicting the feature vectors of n.n., it seems that the exact order is not robust, in the sense very small distance changes can cause abrupt shifts in the target nearest-neghbor ordering. Is there some way for me to understand why this does not pose a problem? Or is there perhaps a way to make the loss function a bit less dependent on the precise order of the generated feature vector sequence? In the computational experiments, with the choice of datasets, it was often hard for me to judge how much different aspects of their 4 network structures were really being excercised. The main issue is the all problems used only 2--3 classes. I could not guess what fraction of data points had actual label changes within the 5 n.n.. For many datasets, \"same class\" might be a pretty good predictor of nearest neighbor label. Alternatively, one can consider the other extreme, of very many classes. Does it still make sense to try to predict the order of nearest neighbor labels in such a setting? The authors provide evidence of some performance improvement, but I would encourage them to provide some intuition about what the networks are actually learning. Some of this can be done with their existing data. For example, on average, what are the distances from predicted feature vectors to the actual nn feature vectors? If the feature sequence is typically badly predicted, then this might allow the authors to propose that the network is *actually* learning some simpler features of the the distributions underlying an actual {feature,label} sequence. This might allow simplified training losses, based, on things like direction and distance to same-label cluster center, direction+distance to average same-class nn.s, direction and distance to closest differently labeled cluster, etc. Or does their data suggest that their models are actually learning the precise nearest neighbor ordering? Such considerations might be able to improve the OOC training, since \"global\" aspects of the distribution features (like \"cluster center\") remain approx. valid as training batches changes. The other question I had was with the oversampling proposition. The extent of class imbalance in the datasets is not described. Perhaps it belongs in Table 1. Their approach seems a lot of work for modest gains usually available with oversampling. Can the authors provide any guideline for how many members a minority class should have before using their sequence-to-sequence technique? Pros: they improve generalization to unseen data. Cons: their models are considerably more complex, and they do not analyze their data in enough detail to suggest whether their complexity is necessary, or perhaps could be reduced. Figures are too small (many unreadable in printed copy). Datasets have very few classes and the extent to which nearest neighbors are of different class not reported.

For the issue of ordering of nearest neighbors , we postulate that this is because when predicting the label of a sample , the model tries to predict k probability distributions and mimic \u201c majority voting. \u201d For example , for a sample x , the predicted label sequence is , say , [ 2,1,1,1,2 ] , the final predicted label would very likely be the same if the predicted label sequence is [ 1,2,1,1,2 ] , due to \u201c majority voting. \u201d An order is quite natural \u2013 based on the distance from the sample . In summary , while there is no direct order , the order based on the distance makes sense in our opinion . To get a better handle on the order , we are currently conducting an experiment where we swap some elements in the order . We will post here the findings as soon as we have them . [ UPDATE ] We have tried to swap the 1st and the 3rd element in the order , and the results only have a tiny difference .

The results suggest that the order of nearest neighbors does not have a big impact .

Regarding your suggestion of changing the loss function to be less dependent on the order of the feature vector sequence , we have actually tried to change the sum of MSE losses ( Sum ( X^T_i \u2013 X^P_i ) ^2 ) to the MSE loss between every X^P_i and the average feature vector ( Sum ( X^T_i ) /k ) or the feature vector X itself . The experiments have showed that our current loss function outperforms these options . Regarding the second issue of how many members a minority class should have before using the seq2seq technique , the minority class proportions for our four datasets vary from approximately 3 % to 30 % ( thanks for the note - we will include such information in Table 1 ) , and our proposed seq2seq technique works well in this range . Since its performance is more stable than other oversampling techniques , we suggest trying this model in the oversampling task as long as the minority class consists of less than 30 % of all samples ."}, {"review_id": "rJl4BsR5KX-1", "review_text": "I had a hard time understanding this paper. The approach is clearly about combining kNN with neural networks, but it wasn\u2019t clear how it is done. After reading the whole paper, my guess is that kNN is done on raw data first, and then its results are used for training a neural network. In particular, a network is trained to predict the labels of neighboring samples, which are obtained by kNN beforehand. A simple figure explaining it in the introduction would be very helpful since the idea is not that complex. Also, the authors also fail to give an adequate explanation on why the method works. The only reason I can think of is that this regularization forces the model to detect if a sample near a class boundary. This is because when a sample is far from boundaries and surrounded by samples of the same class, the model would simply predict that class label. The same is true when predicting out-of-sample vectors because the average position of K'th neighbor is likely to overlap with the input sample due to the randomness of sampling. I don\u2019t really see why a memory-based model is introduced. The external memory is used for holding random samples. It is not clear how the model can use such random samples for making predictions. Also, the authors give no explanation to why it should help. The results also don\u2019t show the benefit of a memory-based model.

They are relatively low dimensional compared to usual datasets used in deep learning. It is not clear if the method can scale to high dimensional data such as images. The vanilla neural network is not really a strong baseline here. Since the authors proposed a regularization technique, it should be compared with other regularization techniques in neural networks.

Regarding the reason why we consider a memory network , the structure of a vanilla memory network fits perfectly with our original thought : after each hop of a memory network , the network outputs a label or a feature vector .

Specifically, the authors propose two families of models built on the popular sequence to sequence neural network models and memory network models, which mimic the k-nearest neighbors model in model learning. Besides, the final label of the classification task will be learned, a sequence of nearest neighbor labels and a sequence of out-of-sample feature vectors (for oversampling) will be also learned in the same time, similar with the multi-task approaches. Since the proposed models are based k-nearest neighbor calculations, which is time-consuming, they also design an algorithm for the \u2018out-of-core\u2019 situation, say load a small portion of data each time to approximately calculate the neighbors. Experiments show that some proposed models work better than baselines in classification and oversampling. Strong points: (1) As similar with the multi-task setting, the proposed model can output some side useful results, such as oversampling vectors. (2) The proposed models work well on the \u2018out-of-core\u2019 situation, which shows that the models are robust. Concerns or suggestions: (1) The training data $x$ is just one data point, it is not a sequence of data. So the idea to model it in a sequence to sequence setting does not make sense. (2) K-nearest neighbors are a set but not a sequence. To model them as a sequence is also strange. The i-th nearest neighbor does not necessarily dependent on the i-1-th nearest neighbor. For example, we consider the one-dimensional case, the focus data may lie between its first and second nearest neighbors. In this case, there is no clear sequence dependence from the second neighbor to the first neighbor. (3) The experiments are not sufficient. They only compare with some weak baselines, such as KNN. As the classification task, there are many state-of-the-art models. Besides of these standard classification models, we strongly suggest comparing with the previous method, Wang et al. (2017), which also proposes to combine the k-nearest neighbors into memory network models. I am surprised that the authors did not compare with this very related work. In my opinion, the idea of utilizing nearest neighbors as external memory in Wang et al. (2017) makes more senses. (4) The experimental results of some proposed sub-models (key parts of final models) are even worse than the basic kNN model.

[ UPDATE ] To get a better handle on the order of nearest neighbors , we have tried to arbitrarily swap the 1st and the 3rd element in the order , and the results only have a tiny difference . The results are shown below ( 4 datasets ) : V2VSLS : 92.07/94.97/86.24/69.87 Swapped : 91.79/94.56/85.99/69.42 These numbers are based on the average of five runs . The results suggest that the order of nearest neighbors does not have a big impact . Note also that in our loss function there is a KL divergence term between the ground truth label and the final predicted label with a high weight . [ UPDATE ] We have also implemented the algorithm from Wang et al ( 2017 ) , which also utilized the nearest neighbors to make predictions . The comparison is shown below ( 4 datasets ) : V2VSLS : 92.07/94.97/86.24/69.87 Memory Network : 79.36/77.98/75.17/61.83 Wang : 64.18/69.64/54.29/52.18 In the implementation of Wang , we have fine-tuned the hyperparameters : K , I , Learning rate . The optimizer used is Adam . These numbers are based on the average of five runs . There is a gap between our models and Wang \u2019 s model , and we were unable to further improve the Wang 's model ."}, "2": {"review_id": "rJl4BsR5KX-2", "review_text": "To exploit the near neighbor/manifold features, this paper proposes to combine k-nearest neighbors of each training data point into the neural network models. Specifically, the authors propose two families of models built on the popular sequence to sequence neural network models and memory network models, which mimic the k-nearest neighbors model in model learning. Besides, the final label of the classification task will be learned, a sequence of nearest neighbor labels and a sequence of out-of-sample feature vectors (for oversampling) will be also learned in the same time, similar with the multi-task approaches. Since the proposed models are based k-nearest neighbor calculations, which is time-consuming, they also design an algorithm for the \u2018out-of-core\u2019 situation, say load a small portion of data each time to approximately calculate the neighbors. Experiments show that some proposed models work better than baselines in classification and oversampling. Strong points: (1) As similar with the multi-task setting, the proposed model can output some side useful results, such as oversampling vectors. (2) The proposed models work well on the \u2018out-of-core\u2019 situation, which shows that the models are robust. Concerns or suggestions: (1) The training data $x$ is just one data point, it is not a sequence of data. So the idea to model it in a sequence to sequence setting does not make sense. (2) K-nearest neighbors are a set but not a sequence. To model them as a sequence is also strange. The i-th nearest neighbor does not necessarily dependent on the i-1-th nearest neighbor. For example, we consider the one-dimensional case, the focus data may lie between its first and second nearest neighbors. In this case, there is no clear sequence dependence from the second neighbor to the first neighbor. (3) The experiments are not sufficient. They only compare with some weak baselines, such as KNN. As the classification task, there are many state-of-the-art models. Besides of these standard classification models, we strongly suggest comparing with the previous method, Wang et al. (2017), which also proposes to combine the k-nearest neighbors into memory network models. I am surprised that the authors did not compare with this very related work. In my opinion, the idea of utilizing nearest neighbors as external memory in Wang et al. (2017) makes more senses. (4) The experimental results of some proposed sub-models (key parts of final models) are even worse than the basic kNN model. I should say that the results are not good enough to support the proposed methods. ", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "Thank you very much for the comments . Regarding the first point , we can regard the input as the sequence of length 1 , and then the seq2seq model can be applied in this situation . Regarding the second point , an order is quite natural \u2013 based on the distance from the sample . In summary , while there is no direct order , the order based on the distance makes sense in our opinion . When predicting the label of a sample , the model tries to predict $ k $ probability distributions and mimic \u201c majority voting. \u201d We have also tried changing the loss function to be less ( or not ) dependent on the order of the feature vector sequence : we tried changing the sum of MSE losses ( Sum ( X^T_i \u2013 X^P_i ) ^2 ) to the MSE loss between every X^P_i and the average feature vector ( Sum ( X^T_i ) /k ) or the feature vector X itself . The experiments show that our current loss function ( dependent sequence ) outperforms these options ( independent or less dependent sequence ) . To get a better handle on the order , we are currently conducting an experiment where we swap some elements in the order . We will post here the findings as soon as we have them . [ UPDATE ] To get a better handle on the order of nearest neighbors , we have tried to arbitrarily swap the 1st and the 3rd element in the order , and the results only have a tiny difference . The results are shown below ( 4 datasets ) : V2VSLS : 92.07/94.97/86.24/69.87 Swapped : 91.79/94.56/85.99/69.42 These numbers are based on the average of five runs . The results suggest that the order of nearest neighbors does not have a big impact . Note also that in our loss function there is a KL divergence term between the ground truth label and the final predicted label with a high weight . Regarding the third point , in our results , our model outperforms a fine-tuned neural network ( with regularization , using the Adam optimization algorithm , etc . ) , random forest , XGBoosting etc. , which we consider as the state-of-the-art general classifiers . For example , XGBoosting is a frequent winner in many Kaggle competitions .

The optimizer used is Adam . These numbers are based on the average of five runs . There is a gap between our models and Wang \u2019 s model , and we were unable to further improve the Wang 's model . Regarding the fourth point , I assume you were referring to the memory networks models and V2VS . That is correct \u2013 we wanted to assess whether those different structures would improve the performance , and unfortunately , they do not perform well . We are reporting these results in order for other researchers not to spend time on such attempts . However , the V2VSLS performance is excellent , and therefore V2VSLS is the main method our work suggests ."}}
