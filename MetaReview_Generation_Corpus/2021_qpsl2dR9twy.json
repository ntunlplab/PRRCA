My main concern is a lack of ablations , which makes it hard to tell which parts of the method are important . - Pros - 1 . The problem is well motivated . The existing literature on learned multi-agent communication primarily addresses the problem of communicating information about partially observed states . However , this is not all there is to communication , and the communication of agent intentions is an important topic to address . 2.The method suggested - basing messages on predicted future trajectories - is sensible and well motivated . 3.The experiments compare the method to a good range of baseline algorithms for multiagent communication , and it performs well . - Cons/Questions - The method proposed has several moving parts , and without ablations it is hard to tell which are the most important pieces . There are a few experiments I would like to see added to work out what is important in the method : * A comparison to the uniform attention case . While the qualitative analysis suggests the attention mechanism is meaningfully used , it would be good to show how this affects performance . * An ablation where all the attention is put on the first timestep , to show the effect of the imagined trajectories . While this is similar to the other communication methods discussed in the paper , I am not sure whether it directly corresponds to any of them . * A comparison to a case where the agents receive only their own messages to condition their next actions .

Regarding additional ablation studies : - As mentioned in the common response , we added ablation studies regarding AM and the length of the imagined trajectory H. Please see Fig.4 in the revised paper . Regarding the modifications of existing environments : - We modified the existing environments to require more coordination among agents . As mentioned in the main paper , the agents in the PP environment should learn to spread out as well as capture the preys in order to gain more rewards . In addition , we increased the size of the agent in the CN environment so that the agent has to be more careful not to crash with other agents . Regarding `` all the attention is put on the first timestep '' : - As mentioned in the main paper , the previously proposed communication schemes are the special case corresponding to $ \\alpha= ( 1,0 , \\cdots , 0 ) $ , which means that all the attention is put on the first timestep . Especially , DIAL sends the learned features of the information in the first time step as messages . Regarding `` A comparison to a case where the agents receive only their own messages to condition their next actions . '' - We compared the proposed IS scheme with the case in which the agents receive only their own messages to condition their next actions , and the result is provided in Appendix D. It is seen that MADDPG-p in which each agent uses own imagined trajectory as an additional input yields better performance as compared to the MADDPG baseline .

More qualitative evaluation seems required to validate from various aspects . - It seems that attention is used to capture which waypoint is more important in an imagined trajectory rather than whose imagined trajectory is more important . If so , is it really important ? Where is the ablative study of using attention ? - Intuitively , when two agents set the same goal ( catching same prey ) , what is the rationale of determining who maintain the goal or who change the plan ?", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Thank you for the valuable comments . Here is our reply : Regarding the use of intention in the literature : - As mentioned in the common response , we added Theory of Mind ( ToM ) and Opponent Modeling ( OM ) , which use the notion of intention , in the related work section . However , please see the common response regarding the difference of our method from these existing methods . Regarding more ablation studies : - As mentioned in the common response , we added ablation studies regarding AM and the length of imagined trajectory H into the revised paper . Regarding the rationale of determining who maintain the goal or who change the plan : - Intuitively , we think that some agents whose policy is sensitive to the received messages ( e.g.the weights connected to the received messages are quite large ) will be trained to be the agents who tend to change the plan , other agents whose policy is less sensitive to the received messages will be trained to be the agents who tend to maintain the plan ."}}
