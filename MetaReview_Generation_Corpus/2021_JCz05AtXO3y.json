A large part of the paper is also given over to a high-level discussion of `` resolution dilemmas . '' The idea of organizing around landmarks ( and making the landmark choice a part of the optimization ) is a nice one , and the new approach certainly seems to improve performance in the graph classification problem . But I would have loved to see a more quantitative treatment of the `` resolution dilemmas . '' All the ideas in this space involve lossy compression of the graph , and the authors characterize this in terms of loss of spatial resolution ( ability to understand the `` high-level '' topology of the graph ) or loss of structural resolution ( ability to understand the prevalence of different types of local structures or motifs ) . The attempt to balance these types of resolution concerns is the main motivation for the current paper . But the discussion of these types of resolution is purely qualitative ; the only place where there is really a quantitative discussion is in the experimental section in Figure 4 . Given the amount of space given over to discussing these different types of resolution , and the connections made ( however briefly ) to regularization ideas , I would have loved so see more of the discussion focus on how spatial and structural resolution can be measured , and how those measures might be used to guide the selection of algorithm hyper-parameters like the number of landmarks .

In the meantime , admittedly , hyper-parameter selection can be always be challenging as in many learning algorithms . In the following , we have summarized our analysis in quantifying and selecting the two resolutions ( Appendix C ) , ablation studies ( newly added ) , as well as future theoretic direction ( with a preliminary analysis currently presented ) . ( 1 ) Quantification of resolutions . Currently , the spatial resolution is directly controlled by k in the k-hop local sub-graph ( around each node ) , and the structural resolution is controlled by the number of structural landmarks , K. These two numbers are directly tunable and so they can be deemed as a convenient quantifier of the two resolutions . ( 2 ) Selection of resolutions . We have shown empirically how these two choices affect the generalization performance . Our observation is that spatial resolution may depend on the size of the graph and the scale of meaningful substructures . For example , in molecules , it is typically good to select k as 2 or 3 hops , which is reflected in our newly added ablation study on the impact of the spatial resolution ( Fig.7 ( a ) ) . For structural resolution , we have shown in Fig.4 that neither too small nor too large K is desirable , and we typically set K = 100 in all our experiments . In the future , we will definitely perform more extensive study and also examine better ways to select the two resolutions . ( 3 ) We have added more ablation studies in Section 5 ( Fig.7 ) to reveal the impact of the hyperparameters on the quality of learned structural landmarks , mainly in terms of the final classification accuracy ( since better landmarks should lead to more discriminative graph-level features ) . These detailed studies shed more light on the main mechanism of our algorithm , and detailed discussions are in the last paragraph of Section 5 . ( 4 ) In the future , we will be actively pursuing a more rigorous theoretic delineation of the proposed method , especially on the dependency of the generalization performance on the two resolutions . Currently , we have a very preliminary analysis on how the mutual coherence of the learned landmarks depends on the structural resolution K ( Appendix B ) . It shows that too large K can lead to high redundancy in the basis , which leads to overfitting ( Marsousi et al. , 2014 ) and unstable dictionary learning ( Donoho & Huo. , 2001 ; Mehta & Gray , 2013 ) . We will further extend this analysis to gain better insights in classification . $ Q $ : using substructure landmarks makes the representation easier to interpret\u2026 but there are no examples illustrating such interpretability . $ A $ : We previously showed a preliminary example on the learned structural landmarks and how they are used to represent graphs ( Fig.8 , Appendix F ) . We will further dig into this example and provide domain-specific interpretations of the landmark in molecule classification . This requires more chemistry knowledge and we are actively working on it . $ Q $ : Typos $ A $ : We have made a thorough proofread and corrected the typos .

In particular , SLIM , an end-to-end trainable method , is proposed to simultaneously learn landmark and graph representations guided by downstream graph classification signals . Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on public benchmark datasets . =Reason for the rating= At this moment , I am standing between 4 and 5 . Overall , I feel the technique proposed in this paper is potentially interesting . However , its current presentation could also deliver quite confusing information . Hopefully , the authors could address my concerns in the rebuttal . =Strong points= 1 . Structural landmark is an interesting idea to approach graph representation learning . This study goes beyond the assumption of `` bag of structures '' , and investigates the angle of modeling interaction between discovered structures . 2.The authors propose the SLIM framework that implements the proposed idea well . 3.The provided empirical evidences suggest the SLIM technique is promising in graph classification tasks . =Weak points= 1 . The key insight `` resolution dilemma '' could be confusing . While one expects graph pooling causes the struggling between spatial and structural resolution , the two resolutions seem to be two orthogonal dimensions . - The discussion on spatial resolution seems to be around the assumption for graph classification : bag of structures ( BOS ) or some more complex model that considers relations between discovered structures . Existing graph pooling methods mostly assume the BOS model , and develop different `` counting methods '' to generate one fixed-size vector for each graph . From the perspective of counting , it is difficult to see how existing pooling reduces spatial resolution , while indeed such pooling methods can not consider relations between structures . Could the authors clarify what exactly `` diminish '' means in the context of `` spatial resolution '' ? - The discussion on structural resolution seems to be around model selection in terms of expressive power from learned representations : if we really can make a choice , which one could result in the most promising generalization performance . This problem is indeed meaningful , but it is not caused by pooling layers and is not necessary to address it at pooling layers . - Overall , it is difficult to see the connection between section 2 and 3 . After zooming into the two dimensions in section 2 , they seem orthogonal , with weak coupling with pooling layers . The authors may need to provide stronger reasoning or evidences to motivate the proposed technique from the perspective of `` resolution dilemma '' . 2.The expressive power of substructure embedding could be a potential concern . Using $ A^ { ( k ) } $ , different layouts within k-hops ( k > 1 ) may not be able to be differentiated anymore . Does this imply different structures within k-hops do not matter ? 3.The presentation in section 3 could be further improved . - The details on how to end-to-end train SLIM is missing in section 3 , while one may find some relevant information in the experiment section . To make each section self-contained and the technique clearly described , the authors may put down the relevant contents in section 3 . - Section 3.3 is definitely critical in the whole framework ; however , the current presentation could unnecessarily increase the difficulty in understanding the idea behind . =Questions during rebuttal period= Please address and clarify the weak points above . In addition , the current draft could use more proofreading to clear typos and grammar errors . The idea of landmark has also been discussed in a recent work [ 1 ] , in the context of unsupervised learning . The authors may need to highlight their unique perspective . =Reference= [ 1 ] DDGK : Learning Graph Representations for Deep Divergence Graph Kernels , WWW 2019 =Post rebuttal comments= The rebuttal has addressed my main concerns . In general , I believe the core idea of modeling substructure interactions in GNNs should be shared in front of more audience . Therefore , I have increased the rating accordingly .", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We highly appreciate the valuable comments from the reviewer . Indeed , these comments help deepen our own understanding , and allow us to further improve/clarify the presentation . Our detailed responses and revisions are summarized below . $ Q $ : While one expects graph pooling causes the struggling between spatial and structural resolution , the two resolutions seem to be two orthogonal dimensions ... The authors may need to provide stronger reasoning \u2026 from the perspective `` resolution dilemma '' . $ A $ : We highly appreciate this in-depth discussion . We are sorry for the confusion and following is our clarification . We have two dilemmas : one for spatial resolution selection , and one for structural resolution selection . The two resolutions are not fighting directly . In fact , the two dilemmas have a causal relation , as discussed in `` Relation between spatial and structural resolution dilemmas '' ( previously the last paragraph of Sec 2 , now Sec 2.3 ) . The logic is ( `` - > '' means `` leads to '' ) : Exact sub-graph matching - > [ structural resolution explodes/dilemma ] - > problematic to compare sub-structure across graphs - > have to use collapsing-style graph pooling - > [ spatial resolution diminishes/dilemma ] That is , a bad ( exploding ) structural resolution leads to a bad ( diminishing ) spatial resolution . Now , SLIM replaces exact matching with landmarking , so the structural resolution becomes well controlled . The logic is updated as : Structural landmarking - > [ structural resolution controlled ( dilemma solved ) ] - > easy to compare sub-structures across graphs - > identity-preserving graph pooling applicable- > [ spatial resolution improved ( dilemma solved ) ] Namely , both resolutions are better selected , and both dilemmas are solved . This seems less of a struggle ( a zero-sum game ) , or orthogonal ( two act independently ) . We could see it as a coordinated , win-win solution by our method . Full discussions can be found in Section 2.3 . $ Q $ : Could the authors clarify what exactly `` diminish '' means in the context of spatial resolution ? $ A $ : Resolution is the ability to identify fine details/parts . After a graph is pooled/squeezed into a single vector , we can no longer differentiate its parts , i.e. , nodes or subgraphs . We can only see the graph as a whole , which is the lowest resolution possible so we call it `` diminishing '' . ( If one can identify the finest parts , i.e. , each node , then it will be the highest spatial resolution ) . $ Q $ : The discussion on structural resolution \u2026 is indeed meaningful , but it is not caused by pooling layers and is not necessary to address it at pooling layers . $ A $ : The reviewer is correct . Based on the logic chain above : ( collapsing-style ) pooling does not cause bad structural resolution ; it is the bad , exploding structural resolution that makes collapsing-style graph pooling an inevitable choice . Now SLIM chooses a better ( non-exploding ) structural resolution , and so identity-preserving graph pooling becomes possible . $ Q $ : The expressive power of substructure embedding \u2026 A ( k ) , may not be able to be differentiated anymore $ A $ : $ A^ { ( k ) } $ can quantify sub-structure differences to a great extent because it looks into node distribution on different `` layers '' of each subgraph from the center node . It may not be strictly injective as GIN layer ( a choice suggested in Sec 3.1 ) , but it serves as a simple block for embedding and works well . $ Q $ : Section 3 could be further improved . The details on how to end-to-end train SLIM is missing in section 3 \u2026 the authors may put down the relevant contents in section 3 . $ A $ : We thank the reviewer for this suggestion . We have revised Section 3 . In particular , we have added Fig.4 to illustrate details of the end-to-end training architecture ( some parts of it moved from experimental section as reviewer suggested ) . In Fig.4 , we have clearly marked the three main steps of our method ( green shades ) , their variables , and related equations . We have also marked the loss function , and specified network parameters in related discussion ( end of Section 3 ) . We believe the new version clarifies a lot . $ Q $ : Section 3.3 is definitely critical in the whole framework ; however , the current presentation could unnecessarily increase the difficulty in understanding the idea behind . $ A $ : We have revised Section 3.3 ; we believe now it \u2019 s clearer and allows readers to easily implement the idea . $ Q $ : The current draft could use more proofreading to clear typos $ A $ : We have thoroughly proofread the paper and made corrections . $ Q $ : The idea of landmark has also been discussed in a recent work [ 1 ] \u2026 The authors may need to highlight their unique perspective . $ A $ : We thank the reviewer for pointing out Deep Divergence Graph Kernel ( DDGK ) , an interesting work that applies the landmark idea with new attention mechanisms for unsupervised graph similarity learning .

This paper studied an important problem of graph mining on graph classification tasks by investigating the challenges that previous graph models encountered and solving them with the proposed method . 2.The developed method is novel and interesting by proposing an inspiring concept called structural landmarking and capturing inherent interactions with it . 3.The analysis and survey of related work with respect to the two mentioned resolution types is comprehensive . 4.The paper is well written and easy to follow . Weakness 1 . The paper lacks enough analyses of behaviors of learned structural landmarks , with only an analysis of choices of their numbers . 2.The time complexity of the developed method is not analyzed and its running time comparison with other baseline methods are also missing . 3.The analysis of how the choices of each part of features learned in graph pooling would affect the results is missing . 4.The experimental part lacks the analysis of why the method performs very well on some datasets while not performing well on others . Summary : This paper studies the problem of graph classification on chemical and social datasets . Existing graph classification methods with graph neural networks learn node embeddings via aggregation of neighbors and combine all node features into a final graph feature for classification , while such operations usually lack the ability for identifying and modelling the inner interactions of substructures . To remedy the information loss in graph pooling , the authors leverage the learned substructure landmarks to project graphs onto them for modelling the interacting relations between component parts of a graph . In this regard , an inductive neural network model for structural landmarking and interaction modelling is developed to resolve potential resolution dilemmas in graph classification and capture inherent interactions in graph-structured systems . Empirical experiments on both chemical and social datasets validate the effectiveness of the method . Generally speaking , the paper is well written and easy to follow , with clear motivation and organization . However , I have concerns about the lack of analysis for learned structural landmarks , since in the paper only the choice of its number is well discussed . Also , the time complexity of the developed method is not well studied . The detailed comments and suggestions of this paper are as follows . 1.The paper proposes to learn structural landmarks and obtain representations of graphs by projecting them . Therefore , the quality of learned landmarks is crucial while the paper lacks enough analyses for them . I suggest providing a more comprehensive analysis for them . 2.The proposed method generates various kinds of graph-level features while lacking enough analyses of their impacts on results .

I suggest analyzing the reasons comprehensively . 5.Only one evaluation metric is used in experiments , which is the accuracy . Since it \u2019 s a classification task , I suggest using various metrics to show the effectiveness . 6.There are some typos in the paper that requires double checking : For example , `` breath-first search `` - > `` breadth-first search '' , `` an molecule '' - > `` a molecule ''", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We highly appreciate the reviewer for the constructive and encouraging comments .

Our response is summarized as follows . $ \\bf { Q } $ : The paper proposes to learn structural landmarks and obtain representations of graphs by projecting them . Therefore , the quality of learned landmarks is crucial while the paper lacks enough analyses for them . I suggest providing a more comprehensive analysis for them . $ A $ : The reviewer is correct that the landmarks are of crucial importance to the final prediction . Therefore , we have been very careful in designing the loss function that promotes the learning of useful landmarks , as discussed in detail in Section 3.2 ( 1st paragraph ) . That is , the landmarks should have high statistical coverage or be somewhat \u201c frequent \u201d ( unsupervised loss ) , and should lead to discriminative interaction patterns ( supervised loss ) . We have also added new ablation studies in Fig.7 ( b ) and ( c ) to study the impact of the unsupervised loss on the quality of the landmarks ( in terms of classification accuracy ) . In future studies , we will provide more concrete examples of the learned landmark structures and their implications in the context of molecule/protein classification . $ Q $ : The proposed method generates various kinds of graph-level features while lacking enough analyses of their impacts on results . I suggest conducting more experiments of ablation study for this part . $ A $ : As suggested by the reviewer , we have conducted more ablation studies on different types of final graph features , and included them in the Table 4 in the Appendix . As can be seen , the `` SLIM-concatenation '' feature and `` SLIM-GCN '' features are slightly worse than the normalized interaction features ( currently reported ) , but they are still quite competitive against other methods . Detailed discussions are in Appendix H. $ Q $ : The detailed statistics of benchmark datasets are not mentioned such as the distribution of number of nodes in graphs . $ A $ : As the reviewer suggested , we have provided the detailed statistics of the benchmark graph data sets in Table 1 . $ Q $ : Although the results are competitive compared with other baselines , the authors didn \u2019 t explain why the method performs well on some datasets while not performing well on others . I suggest analyzing the reasons comprehensively . $ A $ : Our method has the highest accuracy on 6 of the 8 benchmark data sets , among 10 competing methods . For the remaining 2 data sets : ( 1 ) On NCI1 data , our method is the second best ; in fact , it outperforms all other neural network methods and is only inferior to graph kernel method ; ( 2 ) On COLLAB data , our method is worse and ranks No . 6.We speculate that COLLAB data have no node attributes , and have many densely connected subgraphs , therefore , the advantage of structural landmarking becomes less significant . We have added this discussion in Section 5 . $ Q $ : Only one evaluation metric is used in experiments , which is the accuracy . Since it \u2019 s a classification task , I suggest using various metrics to show the effectiveness . $ A $ : We totally agree with the reviewer . We used accuracy mainly because it is a popular choice in the literature of graph classification . As the reviewer suggested , other metrics can make the comparison more comprehensive ( precision , recall , F1-score , AUC curve ) , especially when the data are imbalanced , or there is a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity . Hopefully , the imbalance of the benchmark data we have used seems to be less of a concern ( as shown in Table 1 , right-most column , six among eight data sets are exactly or roughly balanced ) . We will definitely investigate this in more detail and make a more comprehensive evaluation in our future studies . $ Q $ : There are some typos in the paper that requires double checking : For example ... $ A $ : We thank the reviewer for the detailed comments on our writing . We have made a thorough proofread and correction ."}, {"review_id": "JCz05AtXO3y-3", "review_text": "Summary : Authors introduces two new concepts spatial resolution and structural resolution in regards to understanding the graph structured data which are quite interesting and enlightening . Idea about projecting graph information into structural landmarks is intriguing . To help make stronger case , I would suggest to do proper ablation study as it is not clear how much gain is coming unsupervised learning . Pros : Overall I like intuition and the method about capturing the spatial resolution and structural resolution in a strategic manner . Author have some strong empirical performance especially on Protein , PTC and IMDB-M dataset . Cons : Authors argue that the classic graph neural networks which employ graph pooling operations are the bottleneck in identifying necessary substructures ( or their interactions ) for yielding high discriminative performance . However , such statements are quite loose and need further theoretical justification given the fact graph pooling operations such as deepsets or sum-pooling are universal/injective functions in nature and thus can reflect any changes in the graph sub-structure ( however their function smoothness or amount of representative power captured is entirely different issue ) . It not clear why right hand side spectrum in Figure 2 will lead to lower generalization performance or over-fitting . Most of the time motifs/graphlets act as an atomic structure of a graph and their frequency distribution drives the discriminative performance . As such identifying all such atomic structures should be helpful rather than harmful . It would be great if authors can expand on their explanation here and provide a real world example that would be more convincing to support their hypothesis . There are certain paragraphs which are hard to read . For instance , Figure 1 lacks detail description and it is not clear what `` all the nodes are mixed into one '' means in the context . Also , a general suggestion would be to add more descriptive caption for each Figures in the paper . I would suggest to provide compelling real-world examples ( or do more qualitative analysis ) besides the strong empirical performance in the main paper ( there is some discussion in appendix but highlights can be included in the main context ) . Ablation study is missing and thus hard to answer questions such as , is unsupervised learning ( i.e. , learning in Equation 2 ) even needed for getting strong results ? I would really like to see the performance gains due to unsupervised learning . Can authors discuss the computation complexity of their method ?

However , such statements are quite loose and need further theoretical justification $ A $ : We totally agree with the reviewer that traditional graph pooling ( deepsets , sum-pooling or GIN ) produces injective mapping , making it a powerful tool for graph classification . It can be risky to claim that there is bottleneck with it in yielding discriminative representations ( mixing parts together does not necessarily lose information of the parts ) . Inspired by the reviewer , we have adjusted our claims throughout the paper to make them more rigorous : our work is just an attempt to introduce well-studied science of complex systems , in particular the idea of explicitly modelling interactions between component parts of a system , in graph classification ( `` Our Contribution '' , section 1 ) . To achieve this , we provide a new , identity-preserving graph pooling strategy under the framework of spatial/structural resolutions , and observe encouraging performance gain . * * We will not be claiming that traditional graph pooling leads to loss of information * * . In future research , we will pursue a learning theoretic justification of the advantage of explicitly modelling parts and their interactions , besides being potentially easier to interpret . $ Q $ : It is not clear why right hand side spectrum in Figure 2 will lead to lower generalization performance or over-fitting . It would be great if authors can expand on their explanation . $ A $ : The right end of the spectrum in Fig.2 corresponds to learning a dictionary with too many landmarks/code-vectors . As previously discussed in Section 4.1 , too many basis may result in overfitting ( Marsousi et al. , 2014 ) , and a large redundancy of the basis ( \u201c mutual coherence \u201d ) significantly lowers the chance of a faithful signal recovery or sparse coding/clustering ( Donoho & Huo. , 2001 ; Mehta & Gray , 2013 ) . Our empirical study also validated this ( Fig.5 ) . Finally , we speculate computing the landmarks is subtly different than maintaining exact subgraph instances in graphlet/motif . We will study this in more depth in our future research . $ Q $ : Figure 1 lacks detail description and it is not clear what `` all the nodes are mixed into one '' means \u2026 a general suggestion would be to add more descriptive caption for each Figure $ A $ : We have added detailed captions for all the figures as reviewer suggested . \u201c all the nodes mixed into one \u201d means that graph pooling turns a graph of n nodes ( or n vectors ) into a single vector ( by graph pooling ) . $ Q $ : I would suggest to provide compelling real-world examples ( or do more qualitative analysis ) besides the strong empirical performance in the main paper ( there is some discussion in appendix but highlights can be included in the main context ) .

These new results shed light on how prediction performance is affected by hyper-parameters . Currently , we are also digging deep into the learned landmarks in molecule/protein classification , to extract concrete examples to demonstrate the usefulness of the learned sub-graph pattern to domain experts in medical research ( as inspired by the comment of the reviewer ) . This requires more chemistry knowledge and we are working on it . Social networks ( Collab and IMDB ) do not have node attributes so appear less fruitful for such case study . $ Q $ : Ablation study is missing and thus hard to answer questions such as , is unsupervised learning ( i.e. , learning in Equation 2 ) even needed for getting strong results ? I would really like to see the performance gains due to unsupervised learning . $ A $ : This is an interesting question . As reviewer suggested , we have added ablation studies on the impact of the node2vec loss ( 2 ) on the generalization performance ( Fig.7 ( b ) ) . As can be seen , the node2vec does benefit generalization when enforced properly , since it promotes smoothness of embedding w.r.t.sub-structure interactions ( as discussed in Section 3.1 ) . We also have added the impact of the clustering loss ( 4 ) in Fig.7 ( c ) , with similar observation . We speculate that unsupervised losses can serve as regularization to benefit the learning task . $ Q $ : Can authors discuss the computation complexity of their method ? $ A $ : Our time complexity is linear with the number of graphs , the average graph size , the average k-hop neighborhood size for each node , and the number of landmarks K. More detailed analysis is in Appendix G.2 . We have also added the time consumption in Fig.10 in Appendix ."}], "0": {"review_id": "JCz05AtXO3y-0", "review_text": "# # # Summary The proposed SLIM algorithm organizes graph neural networks around substructures surrounding `` landmarks '' in the graph .

For example , in molecules , it is typically good to select k as 2 or 3 hops , which is reflected in our newly added ablation study on the impact of the spatial resolution ( Fig.7 ( a ) ) . For structural resolution , we have shown in Fig.4 that neither too small nor too large K is desirable , and we typically set K = 100 in all our experiments . In the future , we will definitely perform more extensive study and also examine better ways to select the two resolutions . ( 3 ) We have added more ablation studies in Section 5 ( Fig.7 ) to reveal the impact of the hyperparameters on the quality of learned structural landmarks , mainly in terms of the final classification accuracy ( since better landmarks should lead to more discriminative graph-level features ) . These detailed studies shed more light on the main mechanism of our algorithm , and detailed discussions are in the last paragraph of Section 5 . ( 4 ) In the future , we will be actively pursuing a more rigorous theoretic delineation of the proposed method , especially on the dependency of the generalization performance on the two resolutions . Currently , we have a very preliminary analysis on how the mutual coherence of the learned landmarks depends on the structural resolution K ( Appendix B ) . It shows that too large K can lead to high redundancy in the basis , which leads to overfitting ( Marsousi et al. , 2014 ) and unstable dictionary learning ( Donoho & Huo. , 2001 ; Mehta & Gray , 2013 ) . We will further extend this analysis to gain better insights in classification . $ Q $ : using substructure landmarks makes the representation easier to interpret\u2026 but there are no examples illustrating such interpretability . $ A $ : We previously showed a preliminary example on the learned structural landmarks and how they are used to represent graphs ( Fig.8 , Appendix F ) . We will further dig into this example and provide domain-specific interpretations of the landmark in molecule classification . This requires more chemistry knowledge and we are actively working on it . $ Q $ : Typos $ A $ : We have made a thorough proofread and corrected the typos . We highly appreciate the reviewer for the detailed comments ."}, "1": {"review_id": "JCz05AtXO3y-1", "review_text": "=Summary= In this paper , the authors investigate how to learn graph representations from structural landmarks . In particular , SLIM , an end-to-end trainable method , is proposed to simultaneously learn landmark and graph representations guided by downstream graph classification signals . Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on public benchmark datasets . =Reason for the rating= At this moment , I am standing between 4 and 5 . Overall , I feel the technique proposed in this paper is potentially interesting . However , its current presentation could also deliver quite confusing information . Hopefully , the authors could address my concerns in the rebuttal . =Strong points= 1 . Structural landmark is an interesting idea to approach graph representation learning . This study goes beyond the assumption of `` bag of structures '' , and investigates the angle of modeling interaction between discovered structures . 2.The authors propose the SLIM framework that implements the proposed idea well . 3.The provided empirical evidences suggest the SLIM technique is promising in graph classification tasks . =Weak points= 1 . The key insight `` resolution dilemma '' could be confusing . While one expects graph pooling causes the struggling between spatial and structural resolution , the two resolutions seem to be two orthogonal dimensions . - The discussion on spatial resolution seems to be around the assumption for graph classification : bag of structures ( BOS ) or some more complex model that considers relations between discovered structures . Existing graph pooling methods mostly assume the BOS model , and develop different `` counting methods '' to generate one fixed-size vector for each graph . From the perspective of counting , it is difficult to see how existing pooling reduces spatial resolution , while indeed such pooling methods can not consider relations between structures . Could the authors clarify what exactly `` diminish '' means in the context of `` spatial resolution '' ? - The discussion on structural resolution seems to be around model selection in terms of expressive power from learned representations : if we really can make a choice , which one could result in the most promising generalization performance . This problem is indeed meaningful , but it is not caused by pooling layers and is not necessary to address it at pooling layers . - Overall , it is difficult to see the connection between section 2 and 3 . After zooming into the two dimensions in section 2 , they seem orthogonal , with weak coupling with pooling layers . The authors may need to provide stronger reasoning or evidences to motivate the proposed technique from the perspective of `` resolution dilemma '' . 2.The expressive power of substructure embedding could be a potential concern . Using $ A^ { ( k ) } $ , different layouts within k-hops ( k > 1 ) may not be able to be differentiated anymore . Does this imply different structures within k-hops do not matter ? 3.The presentation in section 3 could be further improved . - The details on how to end-to-end train SLIM is missing in section 3 , while one may find some relevant information in the experiment section . To make each section self-contained and the technique clearly described , the authors may put down the relevant contents in section 3 . - Section 3.3 is definitely critical in the whole framework ; however , the current presentation could unnecessarily increase the difficulty in understanding the idea behind . =Questions during rebuttal period= Please address and clarify the weak points above . In addition , the current draft could use more proofreading to clear typos and grammar errors . The idea of landmark has also been discussed in a recent work [ 1 ] , in the context of unsupervised learning . The authors may need to highlight their unique perspective . =Reference= [ 1 ] DDGK : Learning Graph Representations for Deep Divergence Graph Kernels , WWW 2019 =Post rebuttal comments= The rebuttal has addressed my main concerns . In general , I believe the core idea of modeling substructure interactions in GNNs should be shared in front of more audience . Therefore , I have increased the rating accordingly .", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We highly appreciate the valuable comments from the reviewer . Indeed , these comments help deepen our own understanding , and allow us to further improve/clarify the presentation . Our detailed responses and revisions are summarized below . $ Q $ : While one expects graph pooling causes the struggling between spatial and structural resolution , the two resolutions seem to be two orthogonal dimensions ... The authors may need to provide stronger reasoning \u2026 from the perspective `` resolution dilemma '' . $ A $ : We highly appreciate this in-depth discussion . We are sorry for the confusion and following is our clarification . We have two dilemmas : one for spatial resolution selection , and one for structural resolution selection . The two resolutions are not fighting directly . In fact , the two dilemmas have a causal relation , as discussed in `` Relation between spatial and structural resolution dilemmas '' ( previously the last paragraph of Sec 2 , now Sec 2.3 ) . The logic is ( `` - > '' means `` leads to '' ) : Exact sub-graph matching - > [ structural resolution explodes/dilemma ] - > problematic to compare sub-structure across graphs - > have to use collapsing-style graph pooling - > [ spatial resolution diminishes/dilemma ] That is , a bad ( exploding ) structural resolution leads to a bad ( diminishing ) spatial resolution . Now , SLIM replaces exact matching with landmarking , so the structural resolution becomes well controlled . The logic is updated as : Structural landmarking - > [ structural resolution controlled ( dilemma solved ) ] - > easy to compare sub-structures across graphs - > identity-preserving graph pooling applicable- > [ spatial resolution improved ( dilemma solved ) ] Namely , both resolutions are better selected , and both dilemmas are solved . This seems less of a struggle ( a zero-sum game ) , or orthogonal ( two act independently ) . We could see it as a coordinated , win-win solution by our method . Full discussions can be found in Section 2.3 . $ Q $ : Could the authors clarify what exactly `` diminish '' means in the context of spatial resolution ? $ A $ : Resolution is the ability to identify fine details/parts . After a graph is pooled/squeezed into a single vector , we can no longer differentiate its parts , i.e. , nodes or subgraphs . We can only see the graph as a whole , which is the lowest resolution possible so we call it `` diminishing '' . ( If one can identify the finest parts , i.e. , each node , then it will be the highest spatial resolution ) . $ Q $ : The discussion on structural resolution \u2026 is indeed meaningful , but it is not caused by pooling layers and is not necessary to address it at pooling layers . $ A $ : The reviewer is correct . Based on the logic chain above : ( collapsing-style ) pooling does not cause bad structural resolution ; it is the bad , exploding structural resolution that makes collapsing-style graph pooling an inevitable choice . Now SLIM chooses a better ( non-exploding ) structural resolution , and so identity-preserving graph pooling becomes possible . $ Q $ : The expressive power of substructure embedding \u2026 A ( k ) , may not be able to be differentiated anymore $ A $ : $ A^ { ( k ) } $ can quantify sub-structure differences to a great extent because it looks into node distribution on different `` layers '' of each subgraph from the center node . It may not be strictly injective as GIN layer ( a choice suggested in Sec 3.1 ) , but it serves as a simple block for embedding and works well . $ Q $ : Section 3 could be further improved . The details on how to end-to-end train SLIM is missing in section 3 \u2026 the authors may put down the relevant contents in section 3 . $ A $ : We thank the reviewer for this suggestion . We have revised Section 3 . In particular , we have added Fig.4 to illustrate details of the end-to-end training architecture ( some parts of it moved from experimental section as reviewer suggested ) . In Fig.4 , we have clearly marked the three main steps of our method ( green shades ) , their variables , and related equations . We have also marked the loss function , and specified network parameters in related discussion ( end of Section 3 ) . We believe the new version clarifies a lot . $ Q $ : Section 3.3 is definitely critical in the whole framework ; however , the current presentation could unnecessarily increase the difficulty in understanding the idea behind . $ A $ : We have revised Section 3.3 ; we believe now it \u2019 s clearer and allows readers to easily implement the idea . $ Q $ : The current draft could use more proofreading to clear typos $ A $ : We have thoroughly proofread the paper and made corrections . $ Q $ : The idea of landmark has also been discussed in a recent work [ 1 ] \u2026 The authors may need to highlight their unique perspective . $ A $ : We thank the reviewer for pointing out Deep Divergence Graph Kernel ( DDGK ) , an interesting work that applies the landmark idea with new attention mechanisms for unsupervised graph similarity learning . We have included it in our reference , as well as the discussion in Section 4.2 ."}, "2": {"review_id": "JCz05AtXO3y-2", "review_text": "Strengths 1 . This paper studied an important problem of graph mining on graph classification tasks by investigating the challenges that previous graph models encountered and solving them with the proposed method . 2.The developed method is novel and interesting by proposing an inspiring concept called structural landmarking and capturing inherent interactions with it . 3.The analysis and survey of related work with respect to the two mentioned resolution types is comprehensive . 4.The paper is well written and easy to follow . Weakness 1 . The paper lacks enough analyses of behaviors of learned structural landmarks , with only an analysis of choices of their numbers . 2.The time complexity of the developed method is not analyzed and its running time comparison with other baseline methods are also missing . 3.The analysis of how the choices of each part of features learned in graph pooling would affect the results is missing . 4.The experimental part lacks the analysis of why the method performs very well on some datasets while not performing well on others . Summary : This paper studies the problem of graph classification on chemical and social datasets . Existing graph classification methods with graph neural networks learn node embeddings via aggregation of neighbors and combine all node features into a final graph feature for classification , while such operations usually lack the ability for identifying and modelling the inner interactions of substructures . To remedy the information loss in graph pooling , the authors leverage the learned substructure landmarks to project graphs onto them for modelling the interacting relations between component parts of a graph . In this regard , an inductive neural network model for structural landmarking and interaction modelling is developed to resolve potential resolution dilemmas in graph classification and capture inherent interactions in graph-structured systems . Empirical experiments on both chemical and social datasets validate the effectiveness of the method . Generally speaking , the paper is well written and easy to follow , with clear motivation and organization . However , I have concerns about the lack of analysis for learned structural landmarks , since in the paper only the choice of its number is well discussed . Also , the time complexity of the developed method is not well studied . The detailed comments and suggestions of this paper are as follows . 1.The paper proposes to learn structural landmarks and obtain representations of graphs by projecting them . Therefore , the quality of learned landmarks is crucial while the paper lacks enough analyses for them . I suggest providing a more comprehensive analysis for them . 2.The proposed method generates various kinds of graph-level features while lacking enough analyses of their impacts on results . I suggest conducting more experiments of ablation study for this part . 3.The detailed statistics of benchmark datasets are not mentioned such as the distribution of number of nodes in graphs . 4.Although the results are competitive compared with other baselines , the authors didn \u2019 t explain why the method performs well on some datasets while not performing well on others . I suggest analyzing the reasons comprehensively . 5.Only one evaluation metric is used in experiments , which is the accuracy . Since it \u2019 s a classification task , I suggest using various metrics to show the effectiveness . 6.There are some typos in the paper that requires double checking : For example , `` breath-first search `` - > `` breadth-first search '' , `` an molecule '' - > `` a molecule ''", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We highly appreciate the reviewer for the constructive and encouraging comments . We have followed all the suggestions of the reviewer , which greatly improves the paper . Our response is summarized as follows . $ \\bf { Q } $ : The paper proposes to learn structural landmarks and obtain representations of graphs by projecting them . Therefore , the quality of learned landmarks is crucial while the paper lacks enough analyses for them . I suggest providing a more comprehensive analysis for them . $ A $ : The reviewer is correct that the landmarks are of crucial importance to the final prediction . Therefore , we have been very careful in designing the loss function that promotes the learning of useful landmarks , as discussed in detail in Section 3.2 ( 1st paragraph ) . That is , the landmarks should have high statistical coverage or be somewhat \u201c frequent \u201d ( unsupervised loss ) , and should lead to discriminative interaction patterns ( supervised loss ) . We have also added new ablation studies in Fig.7 ( b ) and ( c ) to study the impact of the unsupervised loss on the quality of the landmarks ( in terms of classification accuracy ) . In future studies , we will provide more concrete examples of the learned landmark structures and their implications in the context of molecule/protein classification . $ Q $ : The proposed method generates various kinds of graph-level features while lacking enough analyses of their impacts on results . I suggest conducting more experiments of ablation study for this part . $ A $ : As suggested by the reviewer , we have conducted more ablation studies on different types of final graph features , and included them in the Table 4 in the Appendix . As can be seen , the `` SLIM-concatenation '' feature and `` SLIM-GCN '' features are slightly worse than the normalized interaction features ( currently reported ) , but they are still quite competitive against other methods . Detailed discussions are in Appendix H. $ Q $ : The detailed statistics of benchmark datasets are not mentioned such as the distribution of number of nodes in graphs . $ A $ : As the reviewer suggested , we have provided the detailed statistics of the benchmark graph data sets in Table 1 . $ Q $ : Although the results are competitive compared with other baselines , the authors didn \u2019 t explain why the method performs well on some datasets while not performing well on others . I suggest analyzing the reasons comprehensively . $ A $ : Our method has the highest accuracy on 6 of the 8 benchmark data sets , among 10 competing methods . For the remaining 2 data sets : ( 1 ) On NCI1 data , our method is the second best ; in fact , it outperforms all other neural network methods and is only inferior to graph kernel method ; ( 2 ) On COLLAB data , our method is worse and ranks No . 6.We speculate that COLLAB data have no node attributes , and have many densely connected subgraphs , therefore , the advantage of structural landmarking becomes less significant . We have added this discussion in Section 5 . $ Q $ : Only one evaluation metric is used in experiments , which is the accuracy . Since it \u2019 s a classification task , I suggest using various metrics to show the effectiveness . $ A $ : We totally agree with the reviewer . We used accuracy mainly because it is a popular choice in the literature of graph classification . As the reviewer suggested , other metrics can make the comparison more comprehensive ( precision , recall , F1-score , AUC curve ) , especially when the data are imbalanced , or there is a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity . Hopefully , the imbalance of the benchmark data we have used seems to be less of a concern ( as shown in Table 1 , right-most column , six among eight data sets are exactly or roughly balanced ) . We will definitely investigate this in more detail and make a more comprehensive evaluation in our future studies . $ Q $ : There are some typos in the paper that requires double checking : For example ... $ A $ : We thank the reviewer for the detailed comments on our writing . We have made a thorough proofread and correction ."}, "3": {"review_id": "JCz05AtXO3y-3", "review_text": "Summary : Authors introduces two new concepts spatial resolution and structural resolution in regards to understanding the graph structured data which are quite interesting and enlightening . Idea about projecting graph information into structural landmarks is intriguing . To help make stronger case , I would suggest to do proper ablation study as it is not clear how much gain is coming unsupervised learning . Pros : Overall I like intuition and the method about capturing the spatial resolution and structural resolution in a strategic manner . Author have some strong empirical performance especially on Protein , PTC and IMDB-M dataset . Cons : Authors argue that the classic graph neural networks which employ graph pooling operations are the bottleneck in identifying necessary substructures ( or their interactions ) for yielding high discriminative performance . However , such statements are quite loose and need further theoretical justification given the fact graph pooling operations such as deepsets or sum-pooling are universal/injective functions in nature and thus can reflect any changes in the graph sub-structure ( however their function smoothness or amount of representative power captured is entirely different issue ) . It not clear why right hand side spectrum in Figure 2 will lead to lower generalization performance or over-fitting . Most of the time motifs/graphlets act as an atomic structure of a graph and their frequency distribution drives the discriminative performance . As such identifying all such atomic structures should be helpful rather than harmful . It would be great if authors can expand on their explanation here and provide a real world example that would be more convincing to support their hypothesis . There are certain paragraphs which are hard to read . For instance , Figure 1 lacks detail description and it is not clear what `` all the nodes are mixed into one '' means in the context . Also , a general suggestion would be to add more descriptive caption for each Figures in the paper . I would suggest to provide compelling real-world examples ( or do more qualitative analysis ) besides the strong empirical performance in the main paper ( there is some discussion in appendix but highlights can be included in the main context ) . Ablation study is missing and thus hard to answer questions such as , is unsupervised learning ( i.e. , learning in Equation 2 ) even needed for getting strong results ? I would really like to see the performance gains due to unsupervised learning . Can authors discuss the computation complexity of their method ? Typos : Variables $ T $ , $ b $ in equation ( 1 ) are not defined .", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We highly appreciate the valuable and constructive comments of the reviewer . In particular , we have greatly benefited from the comment in terms of making our claims more rigorous and justified . $ Q $ : Authors argue that the classic graph neural networks which employ graph pooling operations are the bottleneck in identifying necessary substructures ( or their interactions ) for yielding high discriminative performance . However , such statements are quite loose and need further theoretical justification $ A $ : We totally agree with the reviewer that traditional graph pooling ( deepsets , sum-pooling or GIN ) produces injective mapping , making it a powerful tool for graph classification . It can be risky to claim that there is bottleneck with it in yielding discriminative representations ( mixing parts together does not necessarily lose information of the parts ) . Inspired by the reviewer , we have adjusted our claims throughout the paper to make them more rigorous : our work is just an attempt to introduce well-studied science of complex systems , in particular the idea of explicitly modelling interactions between component parts of a system , in graph classification ( `` Our Contribution '' , section 1 ) . To achieve this , we provide a new , identity-preserving graph pooling strategy under the framework of spatial/structural resolutions , and observe encouraging performance gain . * * We will not be claiming that traditional graph pooling leads to loss of information * * . In future research , we will pursue a learning theoretic justification of the advantage of explicitly modelling parts and their interactions , besides being potentially easier to interpret . $ Q $ : It is not clear why right hand side spectrum in Figure 2 will lead to lower generalization performance or over-fitting . It would be great if authors can expand on their explanation . $ A $ : The right end of the spectrum in Fig.2 corresponds to learning a dictionary with too many landmarks/code-vectors . As previously discussed in Section 4.1 , too many basis may result in overfitting ( Marsousi et al. , 2014 ) , and a large redundancy of the basis ( \u201c mutual coherence \u201d ) significantly lowers the chance of a faithful signal recovery or sparse coding/clustering ( Donoho & Huo. , 2001 ; Mehta & Gray , 2013 ) . Our empirical study also validated this ( Fig.5 ) . Finally , we speculate computing the landmarks is subtly different than maintaining exact subgraph instances in graphlet/motif . We will study this in more depth in our future research . $ Q $ : Figure 1 lacks detail description and it is not clear what `` all the nodes are mixed into one '' means \u2026 a general suggestion would be to add more descriptive caption for each Figure $ A $ : We have added detailed captions for all the figures as reviewer suggested . \u201c all the nodes mixed into one \u201d means that graph pooling turns a graph of n nodes ( or n vectors ) into a single vector ( by graph pooling ) . $ Q $ : I would suggest to provide compelling real-world examples ( or do more qualitative analysis ) besides the strong empirical performance in the main paper ( there is some discussion in appendix but highlights can be included in the main context ) . '' $ A $ : We thank the reviewer for this suggestion . As suggested , we have added more discussions and results in Fig.7 , Section 5 . These new results shed light on how prediction performance is affected by hyper-parameters . Currently , we are also digging deep into the learned landmarks in molecule/protein classification , to extract concrete examples to demonstrate the usefulness of the learned sub-graph pattern to domain experts in medical research ( as inspired by the comment of the reviewer ) . This requires more chemistry knowledge and we are working on it . Social networks ( Collab and IMDB ) do not have node attributes so appear less fruitful for such case study . $ Q $ : Ablation study is missing and thus hard to answer questions such as , is unsupervised learning ( i.e. , learning in Equation 2 ) even needed for getting strong results ? I would really like to see the performance gains due to unsupervised learning . $ A $ : This is an interesting question . As reviewer suggested , we have added ablation studies on the impact of the node2vec loss ( 2 ) on the generalization performance ( Fig.7 ( b ) ) . As can be seen , the node2vec does benefit generalization when enforced properly , since it promotes smoothness of embedding w.r.t.sub-structure interactions ( as discussed in Section 3.1 ) . We also have added the impact of the clustering loss ( 4 ) in Fig.7 ( c ) , with similar observation . We speculate that unsupervised losses can serve as regularization to benefit the learning task . $ Q $ : Can authors discuss the computation complexity of their method ? $ A $ : Our time complexity is linear with the number of graphs , the average graph size , the average k-hop neighborhood size for each node , and the number of landmarks K. More detailed analysis is in Appendix G.2 . We have also added the time consumption in Fig.10 in Appendix ."}}
