Integrated with an iterative MCMC method, the authors develop an efficient algorithm and use both synthetic and real data set to demonstrate that their algorithms outperform many other state-of-art algorithms. Major comments: In the beginning of section 3, the authors assume that all the terms that characterize the change-points and anomaly points are normally distributed with mean zero and different variance. However, in classic formulation for change-point or anomaly detection, usually there is also a mean shift other than the variance change. For example, we might assume $r_t \\sim N(\\theta, \\sigma_r^2)$ for some $\\theta>0$ to demonstrate the positive mean shift. I believe that this kind of mean shift is more efficient to model the structure of change-point. My main concern is with the novelty. The work does not seem to be very novel. Minor comments: 1.

The performance is evaluated and compared against state-of-the-art methods on three data sets: 1) synthetic data obtained from the generative Bayesian model itself; 2) well-log data; 3) internet traffic data. On the methodological side, this appears to be a solid and significant contribution, although I am not sure how well it is aligned with the scope of ICLR. The introduced model is elegant; the algorithms for inference are non-trivial.
