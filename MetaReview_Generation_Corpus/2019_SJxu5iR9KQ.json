We hope that our answers clarified our contribution and thank the reviewer again . 1.Contribution of our work We would like to highlight that our work \u2019 s contribution is to provide a need of considering communication scheduling issues in MARL under shared medium contention constraint . To this end , first , we take a shared medium contention issue into consideration in MARL problem which could be a critical problem when deploying the algorithm in the real world , where the communication among the agents are typically done in wireless . Due to the contention , only a limited number of agents are able to simultaneously use the medium . Thus , scheduling is the major concern in this setting . Secondly , we propose the framework to learn how to schedule the communication to achieve the common goal of the application . We employ a weight based scheduling which can cover a various scheduling set , and train a neural network to learn how to set the weight to maximize the common shared reward in MARL . We think that our proposed neural network may not be the best one , which may require to include other smart modules for better performance ( e.g. , RNN structure and explicit consideration of message senders ) . However , raising this scheduling issue to the MARL community seems valuable , which , we hope , motivates further future work . Comparing SchedNet with a round robin scheme is meaningful , since we can see the power of jointly considering the effect of a given task and scheduling , which is actually why we propose SchedNet . The objective of conventional scheduling algorithms in wireless research community is often simple , e.g. , fairness or throughput , which may not be closely related to the common reward depending on the application . Round robin based scheduling scheme is the typical example of scheduling algorithms for fairness . The experiment results show that if the agents learn how to schedule themselves by considering their common goal for better cooperation , then they can get a higher common reward . To the best of our knowledge , SchedNet is the first work that considers the shared medium issues in MARL , and we expect that there will be other further works considering communication scheduling . 2.Implications of our simulation environment We think Predator and Prey ( PP ) environment can be an illustrative example of real-world multi-agent cooperation scenarios . One example is the cooperative task of UAVs ( Unmanned Aerial Vehicles ) where UAV matches to predator in PP environment . In general , UAVs are equipped with wireless communication , and their communication environment is as follows . UAVs are controlled by sequential command whose interval is very short ( e.g. , 0.02 sec ) . If there are a lot of UAVs , then it is difficult to allow all UAVs to have the chance to communicate , because only one agent can broadcast the message at a time . Given such short decision period , only a limited number of agents can communicate before making a decision of every command . Another constraint is about bandwidth . If we use the unlicensed band radio ( e.g. , WiFi , ZigBee ) , the bandwidth is limited due to the regulation on the transmission power . This means that the bandwidth constraint has to be taken into account as well as contention constraint when designing the communication protocol . DIAL explicitly considered the bandwidth constraint into their design , but to the best of our knowledge , there is no prior work which tackles the contention constraint . Although our experiments were done with challenging MARL tasks , yet all evaluations were conducted in a simulated environment . We plan to extend our work into real-world scenario such as UAV and real-time robot control applications , which can be more impactful and challenging ."}, {"review_id": "SJxu5iR9KQ-2", "review_text": "The authors present a setting of MARL communication where only a number of agents can broadcast messages in a shared and limited bandwidth channel.

Thank you for your interest in our article Q1 . It 's not clear to me how do the authors tackle partial observability without the use of recurrent connections or time-steps ? In MARL , there are two ways to tackle partial observability issues . First , using RNN structure to indirectly remember the history can alleviate the partial observability issues . Another way is to use the observations of other agents through communication among them . The goal of this paper is to show the importance of learning to schedule in a practical communication environment in which the shared medium contention is inevitable . Thus , we focused more on the latter in which efficient communication including scheduling helps to enlarge the observation of a single agent well and mitigates the partial observability issue . We comment that each agent uses its own scheduling history as the input of scheduling weight generator in our experiment . Although we did not use a typical RNN structure , we think that using history information of scheduling helps to address partial observability issues . Enlarging the observation through communication is somewhat orthogonal to considering temporal correlation , so merging both approaches is possible . SchedNet does not assume any specific neural network structure as an intrinsic/critical part of its algorithm , where feed-forward NNs is just one choice . We have applied RNN to both IDQN \u2014 in which no communication is allowed \u2014 and SchedNet , and run more experiments in PP environment . We have updated the result in appendix C.2 of our modified manuscript . The results show that the average steps to complete tasks of IDQN with RNN is slightly smaller than that of IDQN with feed-forward network . In this case , RNN helps to improve the performance by tackling the partial observable issue . On the other hand , SchedNet-RNN and SchedNet achieve similar performance . We think that the communication in SchedNet somewhat resolves the partial observable issues . Although applying RNN to SchedNet is not really that helpful in this simple environment , we expect that in a more complex environment , using the recurrent connection is more helpful . Q2.Do the agents know if they were chosen to be broadcasted at the previous timestep ? Yes , the agents know whether they are scheduled in the previous timestep in our experiment . This is reasonable because the previous scheduling information of itself is easy to access in a real environment based on some practical a wireless scheduling protocol . For example in 802.11 WiFi protocol , each agent has a decrementing counter initialized randomly , and check whether the channel is clean ( clear channel assessment ) when the counter turns zero . From this information , each agent can immediately know if the transmission has been done or it is waiting until the channel is clear . As we mentioned above , this information of scheduling histories is usefully used to determine the scheduling weight , which in turn decides whose observation is important or not . Q3.Many times it 's important to know who sent the message , do the agents share this information ? We agree.In our experiments , we assume that the agents do not know explicitly who sent the message . However , agents are trained to generate different messages which might include the unique feature of each agent implicitly . Thus , if identifying the sender is important , the agent learns to encode the sender \u2019 s identification information into a message and to decode the message to extract this information . Also , although the agent does not have the explicit knowledge of who sent the message , the scheduler of SchedNet informs whose message is more important via learning weights . Thus , this helps the agents to consider the message from the agents who have the most important observation . There can be some cases where the agents \u2019 identifying the sender might be helpful . SchedNet can also be easily extended to this case . The information about sender can be used as the input to the action selector ( AS ) , which can be helpful for better performance . If it is not useful , then AS will be trained not to use this information ."}], "0": {"review_id": "SJxu5iR9KQ-0", "review_text": "The authors present a study on scheduling multi-agent communication.
