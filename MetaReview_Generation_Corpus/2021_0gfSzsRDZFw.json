The main concern of the reviewer about the paper is the lack of experimental evidence : it only provides the results for use cases and no quantitative assessment over the larger dataset . For example , Fong & Vedaldi [ 1 ] assessed the method of 50K ImageNet validation images . As far as the reviewer can see , there is no qualitative assessment on a sufficient number of samples which would prove the efficiency and compare the method against the alternatives . This concern is critical for the given score of the paper . 2.Besides of that , it would be also important to emphasise the novelty : why do we need to have another saliency method , does it give any new insights other than the existing ones mentioned in the related work section ? 3.It is also said in the paper : `` We performed a small , non-rigorous statistical study suggesting that scores > 0.9 are p < 0.01 significant against a null hypothesis of smoothly random masks , and extremely unlikely with pixelwise-random masks. \u201d It would be beneficial to see some further details of it as it could improve the analysis 4 .
