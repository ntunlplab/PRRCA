The approach taken by the paper is to solve a constrained optimization problem, where the constraint imposes a (potentially state-dependent) lower bound on the reward. This is done by using a Lagrangian relaxation that learns the parameters of a control policy that satisfies the desired constraints (and also learns the Lagrange multipliers). The presented approach is demonstrated on a cart-pole swing-up task as well as a quadruped locomotion task. Strengths: + The paper is generally clear and readable. + The simulation results for the Minitaur quadruped robot are performed using a realistic model of the robot. Major concern: - My biggest concern is that the technical contributions of the paper are not clear at all. The motivation for the work (avoiding high amplitude/frequency control inputs) is certainly now new; this has always been a concern of control theorists and roboticists (e.g., when considering minimum-time optimal control problems, or control schemes such as sliding mode control). The idea of using a constrained formulation is not novel either (constrained MDPs have been thoroughly studied since Altman (1999)). The technical approach of using a Lagrangian relaxation is the standard way one goes about handling constrained optimization problems, and thus I do not see any novelty there either. Overall, the paper does not make a compelling case for the novelty of the problem or approach. Other concerns: - For the cart-pole task, the paper states that the reward is modified \"to exclude any cost objective\". Results are then presented for this modified reward showing that it results in high-frequency control signals (and that the proposed constrained approach avoids this). I don't think this is really a fair comparison; I would have liked to have seen results for the unmodified reward function. - The claim made in the first line of the abstract (applying RL algorithms to continuous control problems often leads to bang-bang control) is very broad and should be watered down. This is the case only when one considers a poorly-designed cost function that doesn't take into account realistic factors such as actuator limits. - In the last paragraph of Section 3.3, the paper proposes making the lower-bound on the reward state-dependent. However, this can be tricky in practice since it requires having an estimate for Q_r(s,a) as a function of the state (in order to ensure that the state-dependent lower bound can indeed be satisfied).

Please find below our response to your questions and concerns . 1 ) Technical contributions We are glad that the reviewer agrees that we are tackling a long standing and important problem and acknowledge the fact that neither the definition of constrained MDPs nor the application of Lagrangian relaxation to solve these problems is novel by itself . We should have stated our exact technical contributions more clearly and have adapted the paper to do so . For completeness we will list these below : a ) We introduce pointwise , per-state constraints to learn more consistent behavior compared a single global constraint , and regress the resulting state-dependent Lagrangian multipliers using a neural network to exploit generalization across similar states . b ) Instead of recombining the reward and cost directly on the environment side and learning a single value estimate , we train a critic network to output both return and penalty value estimates as well as the Lagrangian multipliers themselves , effectively providing more structure to the critic . We only combine the different terms appropriately for the actor update . c ) We show that we can train a single , bound-conditional policy that can optimize penalty across a range of bounds and can be used to dynamically trade off reward and penalty . 2 ) Comparison with the original benchmark reward We have extended the results on Cartpole to include the original reward as defined in the DM Control Suite ( incl.bonus for low control ) . We found that compared to the original setting , our method is able to reduce the average control norm by over 50 % across the entire episode , and by over 80 % after the swingup phase , without significant reduction in the average return as measured without control bonus . 3 ) Claims about bang-bang control in continuous RL The reviewer is right in that the claim of RL often leading to bang-bang control is too strongly worded . This is only the case when the objective function is not well-designed and one is naively optimizing for success only . Designing a proper objective function is however often not trivial and more of an art , requiring several iterations to achieve the desired behavior . This work tries to remove some of the complexities in designing such a function . 4 ) State-dependent lower bound Defining a state-dependent bound is indeed not trivial and requires knowledge of what is feasible in the system , and as such we leave this up to future work . In this paper we have made the approximation that the state distribution is stationary and the discount is large enough to assume that the value is more or less constant . While this holds for locomotion tasks , this does not apply in e.g.the swingup phase of the cartpole task and as a result the penalty is completely ignored during this phase ."}, {"review_id": "rJlJ-2CqtX-1", "review_text": "This paper proposes a model free reinforcement learning algorithm with constraint on reward, with demonstration on cartpole and quadruped locomotion. strength: (1) challenging examples like the quadruped. (2) result seems to indicate the method is effective There are several things I would like the authors to clarify: (1) In section 3.2, why is solving (4) would give a \"exactly the desired trade-off between reward and cost\"? First of all, how is the desired trade-off defined? And how is (4) solved exactly? If it is solved iteratively, i.e, alternating between the inner min and outer max, then during the inner loop, wouldn't the optimal value for \\lambda be infinity when constrained is violated (which will be the case at the beginning)? And when the constrained is satisfied, wouldn't \\lambda = 0? How do you make sure the constrained will still be satisfied during the outer loop since it will not incurred penalty(\\lambda=0). Even if you have a lower bound on \\lambda, this is introducing additional hyperparameter, while the purpose of the paper is to eliminate hyperparamter? (2) In section 3.2, equation 6. This is clearly not a convex combination of Qr-Vr and Qc, since convex combination requires nonnegative coefficients. The subtitle is scale invariance, and I cannot find what is the invariance here (in fact, the word invariance\\invariant only appears once in the paper). By changing the parametrization, you are no longer solving the original problem (equation 4), since in equation (4), the only thing that is related to \\lambda is (Qr-Vr), and in (6), you introduce \\lambda to Qc as well. How is this change justified? (3)If I am not mistaken, the constrained can still be violated with your method. While from the result it seems your method outperforms manually selecting weights to do trade off, I don't get an insight on why this automatic way to do tradeoff is better. And this goes back to \"exactly the desired trade-off between reward and cost\" in point(1), how is this defined? (3) The comparison in the cartpole experiment doesn't seem fair at all, since the baseline controller is not optimized for energy, there is no reason why it would be comparable to one that is optimized for energy. And why would a controller \" switch between maximum and minimum actuation is indeed the optimal solution\" after swingup? Maybe it is \"a\" optimal solution, but wouldn't a controller that does nothing is more optimal(assuming there is no disturbance)? (4)For Table I, the error column is misleading. If I understand correctly, exceeding the lower bound is not an error (If I am wrong, please clarify it in the paper). And it is interesting that for target=0.3, the energy consumption is actually the lowest. (5)Another simple way to impose constrained would be to terminate the episode and give large penalty, it will be interesting to see such comparison. minor points: * is usually used for optimal value, but is used in the paper as a bound.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "reply_text": "Thank you for your comments . Please find below our response to your questions and concerns . 1 ) Definition of desired trade-off and practical optimization Using \u201c trade-off \u201d in Section 3.2 is indeed an unfortunate choice of words . What we intended to explain was that when the gradient with respect to \\lambda is zero , either \\lambda itself is zero ( and optimizing for the penalty does not worsen the return ) , or the average value is exactly the bound and we satisfy the constraint , while still minimizing the penalty . More broadly , this work situates itself in multi-objective optimization , where the objectives are counteracting at least part of the time , meaning that in order to gain in one objective , one has to lose in the other . It is here that this \u201c trade-off \u201d comes into play . Different ratios of the objective will ( generally ) lead to different results . It is however a priori not trivial to define the right ratio for the desired behavior ( e.g.certain minimum speed , or maximum power usage ) . Formulating the problem in terms of constraints on either objective is often more intuitive . As noted correctly by the reviewer , a full optimization of \\lambda in Equation ( 4 ) in the inner loop would either lead to \\lambda being zero or infinity . In practice , however , one generally updates \\lambda only incrementally before optimizing the policy w.r.t the updated \\lambda . Ideally , one would optimize the policy until convergence before updating \\lambda , as one can effectively switch the inner and outer optimization step , however we found that in practice this is not necessary and instead perform one update to \\lambda for each policy update . We have added pseudocode for the exact optimization procedure in appendix to make this more clear . 2 ) Convex combination If we define L_1 = Q_r-V_r * and L_2 = -Q_c , then L_1 and L_2 are two objectives that we are trying to maximize simultaneously , but in different ratios depending on the value of \\lambda \u2019 . By changing base to L_1 and L_2 we do effectively get a convex combination of L_1 and L_2 . As such , Q_\\lambda \u2019 is always smaller or equal to max ( L_1 , L_2 ) . If we don \u2019 t add this normalization step Q_\\lambda can become much larger , with increasing \\lambda , than either L_1 or L_2 , which we have found can lead to stability problems in the policy update . Another way to look at this is that in order to optimize the return , we want to be able to suppress the penalty until we meet the lower bound . It is indeed correct that the optimization objective does change when optimizing Equation ( 6 ) as is . What should do instead is only consider the gradient w.r.t.\\lambda \u2019 coming from the first term in the numerator . The way we implemented this in practice ensured this implicitly , and it was an oversight of us not to mention this in the original submission , our apologies . 3 ) Benefit of automatic trade off It is indeed the case that during training the constraint can still be violated . Moreover , in the way we formulated it with a lower bound on the return , this will most definitely be the case . It is only at convergence , when the gradient w.r.t.\\lambda is 0 , that the constraint is strictly satisfied . The main benefit of doing this trade-off automatically is that one can specify the desired behavior in terms of a value in one of the objectives , instead of trying out different ratios and verifying the result . Moreover , there is the added flexibility of the ratios changing during training itself , which may help to overcome issues with exploration when the penalty dominates the reward too much at the start of learning ."}, {"review_id": "rJlJ-2CqtX-2", "review_text": "This paper uses constrained Markov decision processes to solve a multi-objective problem that aims to find the correct trade-off between cost and return in continuous control.

However , there are two reasons why this might still be beneficial : one is that the penalty coefficient is now effectively dynamic and can change during training , ensuring higher chances of finding a good solution . Second , by elevating the hyperparameter one level up , we hope that the learning is indeed less sensitive to its specific setting .
