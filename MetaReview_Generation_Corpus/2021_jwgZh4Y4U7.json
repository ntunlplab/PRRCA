The paper builds on work on Neural Logic Machines (Dong et al.), adding temporal quantification.  The main positives to the method are this contribution of the temporal reasoning layers (e.g. iii in Fig. 2).  This layer provides an interesting extension of existing literature in the area.\n\nThe main concerns raised by the reviewers were the following:\n- Contribution of the paper over previous NLM techniques\n- Relation to graph neural networks and other message passing techniques\n- Use of hand-crafted initial features and resultant comparisons to baselines\n- Empirical validation\n\nAfter reading the authors' responses the reviewers reconsidered their positions and engaged in discussion.  While the reviewers appreciate the addition of temporal reasoning layers as an interesting contribution, there is still concern over the magnitude of this contribution and its effectiveness.\n\nAdditional points raised in the discussion include\n- Lack of evaluation on standard, challenging datasets and comparisons to state of the art\n- Ablation study in response (Fig. 6) does not consider absolute removal of temporal layers (main contribution).\n\nOverall, while the paper does contribute an interesting inductive bias for learning with temporal data, the current evaluation is limited in terms of its effectiveness at the classification tasks in the experiments.  Based on the concerns raised in the initial reviews and subsequent discussion, it was determined that the paper is not ready for publication in ICLR.\n\n", "reviews": [{"review_id": "jwgZh4Y4U7-0", "review_text": "Strengths : - The authors address a well formulated and an important problem for lots of practical scenarios . - The paper is well written . - The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several baselines . Weaknesses : - I personally found the proposed approach to be very cumbersome and complicated . It consists of many different components that are not conceptually intuitive . Contrary to some of the recent approaches for modeling visual relations ( i.e.Non-Local Networks or Space-Time Video Graphs ) , the proposed model is much more difficult to understand . In my opinion , this is a big disadvantage because the models that are most useful to the community are usually conceptually ( and technically ) simple , yet effective . - The authors assume that the input features to the TOQ net are hand-engineered , and thus , are not learnable . This is very different to most modern approaches , which typically try to learn all the features from raw pixels end-to-end . Very few recent methods ( to the best of my knowledge ) rely on hand-engineered features for video modeling/action recognition . This begs the question how applicable the proposed approach is to modern computer vision community . - The biggest weakness of the paper is its experimental evaluation . The authors evaluate their approach on 2 small-scale artificial video datasets . Thus , it is not clear whether the proposed approach would generalize to real datasets such as Kinetics , Something-Something , EPIC-Kitchens , etc . Most current action recognition methods evaluate their model on these large-scale real-world datasets . Thus , I think it is imperative that the authors would conduct thorough experiments not only on their small artificial datasets but also on the datasets that are most often used by the action recognition community . In particular , datasets like Something-Something , EPIC-Kitchens , or Charades require spatiotemporal relation modeling as demonstrated by prior work ( i.e.Space-Time Video Graphs ) . - The comparison with the pixel-level baselines ( i.e.Non-Local Networks , or Space-Time Video Graphs ) might not be exactly fair . The authors adapt these baselines to the dataset/task specific scenarios . Compared to their own model , the authors do n't have as many incentives to tune these baseline models for their specific tasks . Thus , I believe that the experiments on the real-world large scale datasets such as Kinetics , Something-Something and Charades are essential for validating that the proposed approach is better than these prior methods . - Missing relevant work : Wang et al. , `` Something-Else : Compositional Action Recognition with Spatial-Temporal Interaction Networks .

I appreciate the authors ' efforts to add new experiments on other datasets . However , in my opinion these new datasets are not very relevant for the action recognition community , i.e.they are small , and they are rarely used to compare the effectiveness of a particular model . In my initial review , I listed a few datasets that are most commonly used for action recognition comparisons . In my view , without comparisons on these more popular datasets it is very difficult to tell the real value of the proposed approach . If the authors could demonstrate close to state-of-the-art performance on those datasets I would be more convinced that the proposed approach is effective . Currently , most of the comparison are done w.r.t baselines that are implemented by the authors which is insufficient in my opinion .

For now , we kindly refer the reviewer to the overview paragraphs in Section 3 , for a holistic view of the proposed model . The first remark in Section 3 also discusses the representational power of TOQ-Nets . TOQ-Net makes a clear , simple , meaningful contribution : using object and temporal quantification operations from first-order logic and linear temporal logic to model the relational and temporal relationships between entities and events . These representational structures have been demonstrated to be useful for characterizing complex temporal events in a variety of domains [ 1 , 2 ] . Although we demonstrate it on some tasks that seem related to computer vision , the TOQ-Net is task-agnostic , is fundamentally different from action recognition models in computer vision , and has unique advantages such as strong generalization to scenarios where there are more agents and objects than were present during training . The learned relational and temporal representations are also robust with respect to temporally warped sequences , and easily transfer to other prediction tasks in a similar domain . In our model , the input transformation layer can be seen as defining basic predicates and relations that will be useful for defining more complex concepts . The relational reasoning layers can build quantified first-order logic ( FOL ) expressions over these basic properties and relations , and can construct expressions that could be interpretable as \u201c the player is close to the ball. \u201d The temporal reasoning layer can represent temporal operations applied to these complex expressions , such as \u201c the player is close to the ball until the ball moves with high speed , \u201d inspired by linear temporal logic ( LTL ) . The quantification operations in these two types of layers realize FOL and LTL quantifiers : for example , the existential quantifier in the sentence \u201c there is a player such that the player is close to the ball , \u201d and the until quantifier in the sentence \u201c the player is close to the ball until the ball moves with high speed. \u201d The closest structure to the TOQ-Net that can be achieved with traditional NN structures would be to make GNN \u2019 s with one node per entity per time step and then stack them into a fairly deep structure , and this is the idea of the Space-Time graph [ 3 ] .

We agree that these models are conceptually similar to each other , and we will clarify our contribution along the following lines . 1.Our relational reasoning layer is a direct application of NLM . It is similar to applying GNNs per-frame , except that it handles high-order edges ( hyperedges ) and uses logic-inspired quantification operations . It can provably realize first-order Horn clauses , up to the model complexity ( e.g. , the number of layers and the hidden dimensions ) . 2.Temporal quantification is fundamentally different from existential or universal quantification in first-order logic . Intuitively , first-order quantifications are permutation-invariant , but temporal quantification needs to take the order of events into consideration . Thus , we draw inspiration from linear temporal logic ( LTL ) and introduce temporal quantification layers to match the model theory of LTL . 3.Our model is substantially different from other existing work on applying GNNs to spatial-temporal modeling . For example , in STGCN , temporal information is captured with temporal convolutions . In Space-Time Graphs , the same entities from adjacent frames are connected with edges . This fundamentally limits the generalization of such networks because convolutional kernels are not scale-invariant . The authors used graph convolution on the derived graph for modeling input sequences . We have compared our work to both approaches and show advantages over them , especially in generalization to situations with a different number of entities or to time-warped sequences . * * Q2 : Graph net/relation net with high-order interaction terms . * * A2 : Please refer to our general response ( Q1 ) . * * Q3 : References . * * A3 : Thanks for the great suggestions .

Specifically , the model follows the neural logic machines ( Dong et al . ) to define the operations in the networks . Authors demonstrate their model under two tasks , trajectory-based soccer event detection , and robot object manipulation event understanding . Using their self-generated datasets from simulators , the authors found that their model performs better than other baselines . Paper strengths : + The logic forms of event understanding is a quite interesting direction , this paper could be a nice contribution towards that field . + The experimental results support authors ' claim on the model Potential cons : 1 . There are not very unique modeling contributions in this paper . The model used is an application of neural logic machines . 2.Although I like the logical way of defining the events , it seems that the current refinement modules are quite similar to graph neural networks ' message passing operations . Is the reason for the proposed model outperforming baselines that there are higher-order terms considered compared to baselines ? What if a graph net/relation net with high-order interaction terms is used ? Is the logical form of expressing the events really necessary ( v.s.a natural language/semantic expression of events + graph nets + high-order terms ) ? 3.Two relevant and missing citations on soccer analysis and human interaction analysis [ 1,2 ] .

We agree that these models are conceptually similar to each other , and we will clarify our contribution along the following lines . 1.Our relational reasoning layer is a direct application of NLM . It is similar to applying GNNs per-frame , except that it handles high-order edges ( hyperedges ) and uses logic-inspired quantification operations . It can provably realize first-order Horn clauses , up to the model complexity ( e.g. , the number of layers and the hidden dimensions ) . 2.Temporal quantification is fundamentally different from existential or universal quantification in first-order logic . Intuitively , first-order quantifications are permutation-invariant , but temporal quantification needs to take the order of events into consideration . Thus , we draw inspiration from linear temporal logic ( LTL ) and introduce temporal quantification layers to match the model theory of LTL . 3.Our model is substantially different from other existing work on applying GNNs to spatial-temporal modeling . For example , in STGCN , temporal information is captured with temporal convolutions . In Space-Time Graphs , the same entities from adjacent frames are connected with edges . This fundamentally limits the generalization of such networks because convolutional kernels are not scale-invariant . The authors used graph convolution on the derived graph for modeling input sequences . We have compared our work to both approaches and show advantages over them , especially in generalization to situations with a different number of entities or to time-warped sequences . * * Q2 : Graph net/relation net with high-order interaction terms . * * A2 : Please refer to our general response ( Q1 ) . * * Q3 : References . * * A3 : Thanks for the great suggestions .
