The paper is well-written and should be of interest to the community. The experiments are well conceived and seem to validate the general effectiveness of curiosity. However, the paper does not actually have any novel contribution compared against prior work, and there are no great insights or takeaways from the empirical study. Therefore, the reviewers were somewhat divided on how confident they were that the paper should be accepted. Overall, the AC agrees that it is a valuable paper that should be accepted even though it does not deliver any algorithmic novelty.", "reviews": [{"review_id": "rJNwDjAqYX-0", "review_text": "The authors consider the setting of a RL agent that exclusively receives intrinsic reward during training that is intended to model curiosity; technically, \u2018curiosity\u2019 is quantified by the ability of the agent to predict its own forward dynamics [Pathak, et al., ICML17]. This study primarily centers around an initially somewhat surprising result that non-trivial policies can be learned for many \u2019simpler\u2019 video games (e.g., Atari, Super Mario, Pong) using just curiosity as reward. While this is primarily an empirical study, one aspect considered was the observation representation (raw pixels, random features, VAE, and inverse dynamics features [Pathak, et al., ICML17]). In examining reward curves (generally extrinsic during testing), \u2018curiosity-based\u2019 reward generally works with the representation effectiveness varying across different testbeds. They also conduct more in-depth experiments on specific testbeds to study the dynamics (e.g., Super Mario, Juggling, Ant Robot, Multi-agent Pong) \u2014 perhaps most interestingly showing representation-based transfer of different embeddings across levels in Super Mario. Finally, they consider the Unity maze testbed, combining intrinsic rewards with the end-state goal reward to generate a more dense reward space. From a high level perspective, this is an interesting result that ostensibly will lead to a fair amount of discussion within the RL community (and already has based on earlier versions of this work). However, it isn\u2019t entirely clear if the primary contribution is showing that \u2018curiosity reward\u2019 is a potentially promising approach or if game environments aren\u2019t particularly good testbeds for practical RL algorithms \u2014 given the lack of significant results on more realistic domains, my intuition leans toward the later (the ant robot is interesting, but one can come up with \u2018simulator artifact\u2019 based explanations). And honestly, I think the paper reads as if leaning toward the same conclusion. Regardless, given the prevalence of these types of testbed environments, either is a useful discussion to have. Maybe the end result could minimally be a new baseline that can help quantify the \u2018difficulty\u2019 of a particular environment. From the perspective of a purely technical contribution, there are fewer exciting results. The basic method is taken from [Parthak, et al., ICML17] (modulo some empirical choices such as using PPO). The comparison of different observation representations doesn\u2019t include any analytical component, the empirical component is primarily inconclusive, and the position statements are fairly non-controversial (and not really conclusively supported). The testbeds all existed previously and this is mostly the effort of pulling then together. Even the \u2018focused experiments\u2019 can be explained with the intuitive narrative that in the state/action space, there is always more uncertainty the farther one goes from the starting point and this is more of a result of massive computation being applied primarily to problems that are designed to provide some level of novelly (the Roboschool examples are a bit more interesting, but also less conclusive). Finally, Figure 5 is interesting in showing that \u2018curiosity + extrinsic\u2019 improves over extrinsic rewards \u2014 although this isn\u2019t particularly surprising for maze navigation that has such sparse rewards and can be viewed as something like \u2018active exploration\u2019. With respect to this specific setting, the authors may want to consider [Mirowski, et al., Learning to Navigate in Complex Environments, ICLR17] with respect to auxiliary loss + RL extrinsic rewards to improve performance (in this case, also in maze environments). In just considering the empirical results, they clearly entail a fair amount of effort and just a dump of the code and experiments on the community will likely lead to new findings (even if they are that game simulators are weaker testbeds than previously thought). It is easy to ask for additional experiments (i.e., other mechanisms of uncertainty such as the count-based discussed in related work, other settings in 2.2) \u2014 but the quality seems high enough that I basically trust the settings and findings. Beyond the core findings, the other settings are less convincingly supported by seem more like work in progress and this paper is really just a scaling-up of [Pathak, et al., ICML17] without generating any strong results regarding questions around representation, what to do about stochasticity (although the discussion regarding something like \u2018curiosity honeypots\u2019 is interesting). Thus, it reads like one interesting finding around curiosity-driven RL working in games plus a bunch of preliminary findings trying to grasp at some explanations and potential future directions. Evaluating the paper along the requested dimensions: = Quality: The paper is well-written with a large set of experiments, making the case that exclusively using curiosity-based reward is very promising for the widely-used game RL testbeds.

In the experimental studies, the authors also compared several feature space embedding methods, including identical mapping (pixels), random embedding, variational autoencoders and inverse dynamics features. The authors found that in many of the tasks, learning based on intrinsic rewards could generate good performance on extrinsic rewards, when the intrinsic rewards and extrinsic rewards are correlated. The authors also found that random features embedding, somewhat surprisingly, performs well in the tasks. Overall, the paper is well written with clarity. Experimental setup is easy to understand. The authors provided code, which could help other researchers reproduce their result. Weaknesses: 1) as an experimental study, it would be valuable to compare the performance of curiosity-based learning versus learning based on well-defined extrinsic rewards. The author is correct that in many tasks, well-behaved extrinsic rewards are hard to find. But for problems with well-defined extrinsic rewards, such a comparison could help readers understand the relative performance of curiosity-based learning and/or how much headroom there exists to improve the current methods. 2) it is surprising that random features perform so well in the experiments.

We will add more details on the architectures to the appendix ."}, "2": {"review_id": "rJNwDjAqYX-2", "review_text": "In this paper, the authors presented a large experimental study of curiosity-driven reinforcement learning on various tasks. In the experimental studies, the authors also compared several feature space embedding methods, including identical mapping (pixels), random embedding, variational autoencoders and inverse dynamics features. The authors found that in many of the tasks, learning based on intrinsic rewards could generate good performance on extrinsic rewards, when the intrinsic rewards and extrinsic rewards are correlated. The authors also found that random features embedding, somewhat surprisingly, performs well in the tasks. Overall, the paper is well written with clarity. Experimental setup is easy to understand. The authors provided code, which could help other researchers reproduce their result. Weaknesses: 1) as an experimental study, it would be valuable to compare the performance of curiosity-based learning versus learning based on well-defined extrinsic rewards. The author is correct that in many tasks, well-behaved extrinsic rewards are hard to find. But for problems with well-defined extrinsic rewards, such a comparison could help readers understand the relative performance of curiosity-based learning and/or how much headroom there exists to improve the current methods. 2) it is surprising that random features perform so well in the experiments. The authors did provide literature in classification that had similar findings, but it would be beneficial for the authors to explore reasons that random features perform well in reinforcement learning.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "reply_text": "We thank you for the constructive feedback and discuss some of your comments below . R3 : `` it would be valuable to compare the performance of curiosity-based learning versus learning based on well-defined extrinsic rewards '' = > We would like to highlight that evaluating success of pure curiosity-driven exploration ( no extrinsic rewards for training ) by measuring the extrinsic score of game is just a proxy to evaluate exploration . Our results show that exploration via curiosity has striking correlation with game scores . But we expect that when environments have a well-defined ( and well-shaped ! ) extrinsic reward , a policy trained using that extrinsic reward should outperform the policy trained with only curiosity especially when the performance is measured by the extrinsic return . There are , however , examples , such as the Bowling Atari game , where a policy trained with only curiosity does * better * than a policy trained with extrinsic rewards . The purely curious agent learns to play the game better than agents trained to maximize the ( clipped ) extrinsic reward directly . We think this is because the agent gets attracted to the difficult-to-predict flashing of the scoreboard occurring after the strikes . We expect such examples to come from environments with misleading or poorly-shaped extrinsic rewards .

'' = > In the paper , Section 2.1 , we discuss that random features have advantages that they are they are stable , compact , and tend to include most relevant information about the observation . However , in our opinion , a more interesting question is not why random features perform so well , but rather why the feature learning methods perform so poorly ( relative to this baseline ) . Learning the features introduces non-stationarity that confounds the effects of learning the dynamics . We believe that if methods are developed to address this non-stationarity , or environments that are more visually complex are used , then the benefits of the learning the features will become more noticeable ."}}
