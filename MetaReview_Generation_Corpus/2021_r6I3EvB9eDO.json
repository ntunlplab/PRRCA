The description is as follows : `` Compositionality arises when we compare different samples , where some components are the same but others are not . This means compositionality is related to the changes between samples . These changes can be regarded as mappings , and since the changes are invertible , the mappings are bijective . To study compositionality we consider a set of all bijections from a set of possible representation values to the set itself , and construct a group with the following Proposition 4.1 . `` .

Unfortunately , I still feel the contribution and value of the work is not well communicated . Many of my previous points still stand . It is not a sufficient response to just say that the two propositions are the main contribution and the critical summary of findings and their relevance . Original Review This paper presents a group-theoretic approach to compositionality , and attempts to provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the possibility of compositional representations . While this is an admirable goal , I am concerned that the paper does not live up to it . I recommend rejection at present , unless the definitions and presentation are substantially clarified . * The authors have assumed a particular definition of `` compositional '' for `` compositional representations , '' but they have neither clearly stated a definition for compositional representations nor justified it . Section 4.2. does not clearly state a definition of compositionality . * The authors cite Bengio ( 2013 ) as a reference when they introduce the idea of learning compositional representations , but this term is not defined there . In their mathematical definitions , they appear to assume compositional = componential . * However , what it means for a representation to be compositional is actually quite difficult to assess , some of the papers that the authors cite ( e.g.Andreas , 2019 ) discuss this . See also Zadrozny ( 1992 ) . * The authors definition of compositionality seems to my view to be closer to a notion of disentanglement . Indeed , their definition of compositionality itself seems to closely reflect the disentanglement definition given in Higgins et al . ( 2018 ) .The authors note that representations could still be compositional even if the features are not statistically independent , which is valid , but does not contradict the point I am making here . * My point is that , from Montague , we know we can define compositionality in terms of any composition operator in representation space . The authors do not justify that * any * composition operator could be specified in terms of their definition of compositionality . In fact , it seems clear that assuming a product of a finite number of subgroups could * not * capture the original linguistic goals of compositionality , which was * precisely * to allow * infinite recombination of elements to arbitrary depth * . For example , the grammar of arithmetic symbols allows arbitrarily long sequences of operations . How could this structure be experessed in this framework ? * It appears to me tha this article is therefore not about compositionality per se , but rather about disentanglement of a finite number of subgroups underlying the data . This is also a subject worth investigating , but the paper framing should reflect this , and the relation to prior work should clarify more fully how it differs from prior group-theoretic definitions of disentanglement ( e.g.Higgins et al. , 2018 ) . * Other definitions are not clearly expressed either . For example , what are the `` original '' representations that the authors refer to , where do they come from ? This entails certain assumptions about e.g.the mapping from possibly noisy data into the representational spaces that are essential to understanding whether these ideas have any meaning in practice . * In general , the authors focus too much on formal notation , without developing intuitions for what results mean and why they would be useful . The authors present a page of group theory definitions , but this seems almost certain to be unhelpful . Any reader who is not familiar with group theory will not be able to develop sufficient intuitions to understand the rest of the paper from reading these terse definitions without examples , and to those of us familiar with group and category theory this is space that could be much better spent on clarifying and elaborating the exposition of the contributions . In summary , I think that while this work could present a useful contribution to understanding disentanglement , it would need substantial rethinking of the definitions , more connection with the prior work , and clarification of the writing and exposition for me to see it as ready to present .

Is it possible to provide a more intuitive statement ( even if not fully precise ) for these ? * `` We will provide examples and look into more details in discussion section . '' For this reader at least , it would have helped to have examples more thoroughly laid out in Sections 3 and 4 . For example : what structure of groups is being assumed for X and Y in 4.1-4.2 ? Y is assumed to be compositional representations , but we have n't been given a clear definition of that concept or an exact example . # Typographic comments : * I think e in definitions 3.8 and 3.9 refers to the identity element of the group , but this should be stated explicitly ( e.g.in the definition of a group ) . * Defn 3.12 : I 'd use X instead of A here for consistency .", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "reply_text": "Q1 : The text is hard to follow without motivating examples of the definitions and theorems . A1 : We are going to add an example . Q2 : The applications in the discussion section are somewhat opaque . The application to attention does n't appear to make any explicit reference to the attention mechanism at all . A2 : In attention mechanism , query and keys generate attention maps . Attention map and attended values are the two components in the example . Q3 : While theoretical understanding is extremely valuable , it 's unclear how to use the results to detect or promote compositionality as usually understood . A3 : Please refer to the application part in common reply ."}}
