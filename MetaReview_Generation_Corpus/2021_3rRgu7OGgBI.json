In my opinion , $ L_ { CE } $ and $ L_ { CCE } $ are from the classifier head , they are supervised cross-entropy loss , while $ L_ { CCL } $ is from the projector head , it is an unsupervised contrastive loss . Is n't adding these three values a `` naive combination '' ? If the core idea is only improved the loss function , I think such novelty is limited . - Considering the comprehensive experiments , a deeper analysis of the proposed method would have been nice . The idea of novel categorical contrastive loss $ L_ { CCL } $ on the projector head , expanding the scope of positive keys to a set of instances , what kind of scope ? What effect will the scope change have on the result ? The author stated that `` resulting in more harmonious cooperation between the supervised and unsupervised learning mechanisms '' , some form of theoretical/analytical reasoning behind the effectiveness would provide greater insights into the community and facilitate further research in this direction . - The claim of the 10.7\\ % absolute rise on CUB with a sampling rate of 25\\ % mentioned in the abstract has not been clearly addressed and pointed out in the results section of the paper .

We will address your comments through both feedback and revision . * * Q : Novelty and naive combination of the losses : * * - The statement `` The naive combination of the supervised cross-entropy loss and the unsupervised contrastive loss is not an optimal solution for fine-tuning '' is referred to the widely-used GPT-style combination : jointly optimizing the loss used in pre-training stage ( unsupervised contrastive loss here ) and the loss of downstream task ( cross-entropy for classification ) . - In the experiment section , we have evaluated that straightforward combination of contrastive loss + cross-entropy for fine-tuning . As shown in the * * GPT\\ * * * row of Table 3 , the inclusion of `` plain '' contrastive loss is unsatisfactory . The proposed Bi-tuning outperforms the `` plain '' method by $ 3.90\\ % $ on average . - Further , as shown in Figure 4c of the appendix , the tSNE visualization of fine-tuning with * * GPT * * * is less discriminative than that of Bi-tuning , which indicates intuitively that the `` plain '' contrastive loss conflicts with the standard cross-entropy loss . - Specifically , the `` plain '' contrastive loss will push each data point apart from the others , while the standard cross-entropy loss will pull close the data points of the same class . Conflict happens . By seamlessly incorporating the class information into the proposed losses , such a conflict is readily resolved . - This paper embeds the idea of contrastive learning into the fine-tuning stage in a dual-head architecture and applies two newly designed contrast-based losses that tailor better to downstream classification tasks . In particular , $ L_\\text { CCE } $ is a novel idea to integrate contrast into cross-entropy loss . * * Q : What is the scope you apply contrasts * * - We expend Section 3 , providing more insights into our proposed losses . Here we further clarify that , besides the contrasts constructed from data augmentations , we further expand the scope of positive keys using all the instances from the same class to the query . * * Q : 10.7 % absolute rise * * - This statement refers to Table 3 . When fine-tuning MoCo ( ResNet-50 ) to CUB with 25 % data , we achieve 10.7 % absolute rise . We will clarify these misleading statements in the revision . * * Q : Visualization in Figure 3 * * - Thanks for your detailed reviews ; we fix some wrong links to Figure 3 . - Figure 3 is a set of attention maps attained by a visualization tool which shows discriminative localization ( Fong et al. , 2017 ) . We infer that supervised pre-training will obtain representations focusing on the discriminative part and ignoring the background part as shown in Figure 3 ( c ) . In contrast , unsupervised pre-training pays uninformative attention to every location of an input as shown in Figure 3 ( d ) . We hypothesize that this phenomenon may contribute to effective performance when fine-tuning to downstream tasks that focus more on fine-grained local information . And the attention maps of Bi-tuning in Figure 3 ( e ) indicate that fine-tuning to classification task is more similar to supervised pre-training than to unsupervised pre-training . * * Q : Set up experiments for CCE and CCL independently * * - Our ablations reveal that using CCE and CCL simultaneously without CE can obtain a comparable result . We can not use CCL alone because it is only performed on the projector head and does not directly supervise the classifier . CCE can work in place of the conventional CE loss but shows no obvious superiority over CE . So we tend to recommend using CCE and CCL simultaneously to boost CE loss ."}, {"review_id": "3rRgu7OGgBI-1", "review_text": "Summary : The authors propose to augment the regular fine-tuning stage by two additional loss : a contrastive cross-entropy loss ( L_CCE ) and a categorical contrastive learning loss ( L_CCL ) . For each input example , L_CCE minimizes the relative distance between its representation and the softmax linear weight ( compared to the distance between another image from the same class and the linear weight ) . L_CCl encourages representations from the same class to stay close with each other . Empirical results on CUB , Cars , Aircraft and COCO-70 show the advantage of the method . Strength : 1 . Exploring the intrinsic structure of the downstream task is an interesting direction to improve transfer learning performance . 2.The proposed method shows consistent improvements across various datasets . Weakness : The additional loss terms are not well-motivated and difficulty to justify . How do they help the model exploit the intrinsic data structure ? a.In Eq3 , L_CCE computes the log ratio between { the distance between the representation h_ { i } ^ { q } and the weight of the true class w_ { y_i } } and the sum of { the distance between the positive key set h_ { j } ^ { k } and the weight of the true class w_ { y_i } } What does this log ratio term represent ? The numerator can be bigger than the denominator in this case ( and then the log term will be negative ) . Also if you just want to encourage instances from the same class to stay closer in the representation space , why do n't you just explicitly minimize the L2 distance between the representation and the prototype ? b.The goal of L_CCL is to encourage examples from the same class to stay closer with each other . Since the positive and negative sets are constructed using the label information , I do n't see how it is complimentary to the original cross entropy loss . Also , in the case where the size of the positive set |S_i| is bigger than one , equation 4 may not make much sense as there are positive examples in the denominator . Maybe I missed or misunderstood something , but based on these questions and concerns , I found it hard to justify the improvement .", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "Thanks for your detailed comments . We reorganize Section 4 in our new revision . We also rewrite the formulas in a more readable manner to clarify any possible confusion . * * Q * * : Why there are positive examples contributing to the denominator in $ L\\_\\text { CCL } $ and $ L\\_\\text { CCE } $ : The straightforward approach to expand the standard contrastive loss ( $ L\\_ { \\text { InfoNCE } } $ ) into a form of multi-positives ( denoted by a positive key set $ { |\\mathbf { K } \\_p| } $ ) is $ $ { L ' } \\_\\text { InfoNCE } =-\\frac { 1 } { |\\mathbf { K } \\_p| } \\sum\\_ { \\mathbf { k } \\_ { + } \\in \\mathbf { K } \\_p } \\log\\frac { \\exp ( \\mathbf { q } \\cdot \\mathbf { k } \\_ { + } /\\tau ) } { \\exp ( \\mathbf { q } \\cdot \\mathbf { k } \\_ { + } /\\tau ) +\\sum\\_ { \\mathbf { k } \\_ { - } \\in { \\mathbf { K } \\_n } } \\exp ( \\mathbf { q } \\cdot \\mathbf { k } \\_ { - } /\\tau ) } $ $ where $ { |\\mathbf { K } \\_n| } $ denotes the negative key set . We denote this loss function by $ { L ' } \\_\\text { InfoNCE } $ , which essentially performs multiple * * individual * * contrasts with different positive keys for each query $ q $ . The losses ( $ L\\_\\text { CCL } $ and $ L\\_\\text { CCE } $ ) we proposed are based on the following formula : $ $ L\\_ { \\text { proposed } } =-\\frac { 1 } { |\\mathbf K\\_p| } \\sum\\_ { \\mathbf { k } \\_ { + } \\in \\mathbf K\\_p } \\log\\frac { \\exp ( \\mathbf { q } \\cdot \\mathbf { k } \\_ { + } /\\tau ) } { \\sum\\_ { k^+\\in \\mathbf K\\_p } \\exp ( \\mathbf { q } \\cdot \\mathbf { k } \\_ { + } /\\tau ) +\\sum\\_ { \\mathbf { k } \\_ { - } \\in { \\mathbf K\\_n } } \\exp ( \\mathbf { q } \\cdot \\mathbf { k } \\_ { - } /\\tau ) } $ $ Different from $ { L ' } \\_\\text { InfoNCE } $ , in the denominator of $ L\\_ { \\text { proposed } } $ , both the positive keys in the same class with the query and the negative keys from other classes are presented . For each contrast with multiple positive keys , a query here needs to * balance * all positive keys simultaneously . In another view , $ L\\_ { \\text { proposed } } $ can be regarded as performing cross-entropy on soft labels of uniform probability $ \\frac { 1 } { |\\mathbf K\\_p| } $ for each positive key . $ L\\_\\text { proposed } $ introduces a * uninformative prior * that the positive keys are uniformly distributed around the query . We discuss these two forms ( $ { L ' } \\_\\text { InfoNCE } $ and $ L\\_ { \\text { proposed } } $ ) in the revision and conduct them on CUB datasets with $ 100 $ % data . $ L\\_\\text { proposed } $ yields more accuracy gains than $ { L ' } \\_\\text { InfoNCE } $ . | CUB 100 % | Fine-tuning | Bi-tuning with $ { L ' } _\\text { InfoNCE } $ | Bi-tuning with $ L_ { \\text { proposed } } $ | | -- | -- | - | | | Accuracy | 80.74 | 81.20 | 82.93 | * * Q : How is $ L\\_ { \\text { CCL } } $ complimentary to the original $ L\\_\\text { CE } $ : * * The two losses have the following fundamental distinction : - Through standard cross-entropy loss $ L\\_\\text { CE } $ , we will learn a hyperplane for discriminating each class from the other classes , and the instances of each class are only required to be far away from its associated hyperplanethey are not required to form into a compact structure in the metric space . - Through the proposed categorical contrastive loss $ L\\_ { \\text { CCL } } $ , besides requiring the instances of each class to stay far away from those of the other classes , we further require that they should form a compact structure in the metric space where each is close to the other . This is exactly the advantage of * contrast-by-metric * over * far-from-hyperplane * . - Hence , the proposed $ L\\_ { \\text { CCL } } $ can be complimentary to the original $ L\\_\\text { CE } $ . * * Q : $ L\\_ { \\text { CCE } } $ clarification : * * - Except for the way of computing the logits , $ L\\_\\text { CCE } $ has similar form as $ L\\_\\text { proposed } $ . As the numerator term also appears in the denominator , the fraction will be never larger than $ 1 $ . Overall $ L\\_\\text { CCE } $ is an interesting hybrid of $ L\\_\\text { CE } $ and $ L\\_\\text { InfoNCE } $ . The log term is introduced due to the cross-entropy over the softmax-based probability . - $ L\\_\\text { CCE } $ ( Eq.3 ) can be regarded as a dual view of the conventional cross-entropy loss $ L\\_ { \\text { CE } } $ ( Eq.2 ) .As revealed in Figure 1 , to find the correct class , $ L\\_\\text { CCE } $ performs column-wise championship while $ L\\_ { \\text { CE } } $ performs row-wise championship . Further , instead of operating loss computation along the class dimension ( * i.e . * number of classes ) , $ L\\_\\text { CCE } $ operates along the key-set dimension ( $ K+1 $ ) . Further , if we regard $ L\\_ { \\text { CE } } $ as a class-wise championship , then $ L\\_\\text { CCE } $ can be regarded as an instance-wise championship . - Experiments in Table 3 show that minimizing the $ L\\_2 $ distance between the representation space and the class prototype only brings limited benefits , as shown in the * * Center * * ( a.k.a.the center loss which assumes Gaussian for each class ) row of the table . Bi-tuning outperforms these competitors significantly ."}, {"review_id": "3rRgu7OGgBI-2", "review_text": "# # # Summary The paper suggests to extend fine-tuning of pre-trained representations by adding additional contrastive losses to leverage the intrinsic structure of the downstream training data . The authors call the presented method Bi-tuning and evaluate it by comparing it to other variants of fine-tuning . # # # Quality , clarity , originality and significance The paper describes its motivation well , and Sections 1 and 2 are well-written and clear . Sections 3 , 4 , and especially 5 , I found less clear and in some parts a bit confusing . One point that I found not entirely clear in the motivation is the focus on the conjunction of * fine-tuning * and * supervised contrastive learning * . Others have looked at the latter for general training , e.g . [ arXiv:2004.11362 ] ( https : //arxiv.org/pdf/2004.11362.pdf ) or [ arXiv:1808.04699 ] ( https : //arxiv.org/pdf/1808.04699.pdf ) , so it is not clear to me why the Bi-tuning loss is restricted ( in this study ) to fine-tuning only . If the loss is universally applicable , should n't it also work for training in general ? Or if there is a reason to not expect this ( i.e.to expect that it should only work well with pre-training ) this should be explained ( or the explanation emphasized if I missed it ) . If the focus is on bringing contrastive learning to the fine-tuning stage , then maybe an inclusion of some more `` plain '' contrastive losses on the way to the `` novel '' loss introduced here may lead to a better understanding , focusing specifically on the fine-tuning stage . The experimental results look good at first glance , but overall I found it hard to evaluate how convincing they are because of several potential problems : * The experimental results are not compared to any results from the existing literature , all baselines and comparisons are entirely from this paper . This makes it hard to know how much careful tuning went into the proposed algorithm versus the baselines . I think at least * some * comparison to results from the literature should be possible or it should be carefully explained why such an overfitting to the proposed algorithm clearly did not happen . For example , the [ SpotTune paper ] ( https : //www.cs.utexas.edu/~grauman/papers/CVPR19_spottune.pdf ) contains numbers for CUBS and Cars that look comparable at first glance because they also use pre-trained ResNet-50 models , and they include numbers for L2-SP that are better than the ones in this paper . It may be very insightful to compare results to these or other similar results . There seems to be some overlap with methods/datasets to ( Chen et al. , 2019 ) , but then again there are differences like the percentages of data samples . * There are a lot of seemingly random choices in the selection of the datasets , e.g.why CUB/Cars/Aircraft and not e.g.CIFAR , Dogs , Pets , Flowers , or Birds ? I 'm not saying any of these choices are inherently better , but the authors should explain * why * these datasets are chosen , to avoid the impression that the datasets may have been chosen because the proposed method works particularly well on these dataset combinations . One way to make the results stronger would therefore be to use combinations of datasets that other , previous work has already used , which would also enable a direct comparison ( see above ) . * Again in a similar fashion , Table 4 evaluates only one target data set , why only this one ? # # # Pros and cons * Pros : interesting exploration of fine-tuning with added contrastive losses * Cons : experimental results not very convincing , main message is not very clear # # # Minor details and comments * Novelty of the presented components seemed a bit overstated to me in some parts . E.g.words like `` improved '' , `` novel '' , `` newly-designed '' are used throughout the work when it is not entirely clear ( at least to me ) where exactly the novelty lies . * `` the best learning rate is selected by cross-validation under a 100 % sampling rate and applied to all four sampling rates . '' - how exactly is the cross-validation performed here ? * Sec.5.1 . does not seem to specify the pretraining dataset . I assume it 's ImageNet , but giving some specifics ( e.g.was a particular publicly available checkpoint used ) might be helpful . * `` Previous fine-tuning methods mainly focus on improving performance under low-data regime paradigms . '' It seems recently there are several works using fine-tuning to ImageNet , which may count as large-scale , too ? E.g . [ PapersWithCode-ImageNet ] ( https : //paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-imagenet ) has several approaches near the top-performing methods that would fall into that category I think . * Figure 2 ( b ) : performance seems not yet saturated going to higher dimensionality - would it make sense to go even higher ? * Figure 3 is very hard to interpret I think and it is only explained extremely briefly by citing a reference . Why is the visualization uniform in case ( d ) ? What does the visualization show ? Which model and data were used ? Also the conclusion `` Bi-tuning in 3 ( e ) captures both local details and global category-structures '' is not evident from the figure alone , I think it may need more explanation and interpretation .", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We appreciate your detailed comments . We have conducted more experiments following your suggestions and appended them to the revision . * * Q : The focus of this paper * * - We clarify that this paper focuses on the fine-tuning stage since fine-tuning is one of the most classical and popular paradigms of transfer learning . - As for pre-training , the proposed contrastive losses can not apply to unsupervised pre-training due to the requirement of labeled data . We agree with the reviewer that , while out of the scope of the current paper , exploring the proposed losses in the supervised pre-training stage or general training is a promising future research direction . - In the experiment section , we have evaluated that straightforward combination of contrastive loss with fine-tuning , i.e.the inclusion of `` plain '' contrastive loss as mentioned by the reviewer , is unsatisfactory ( see the * GPT * * row in Table 3 ) . The proposed Bi-tuning outperforms the `` plain '' method by 3.90 % on average . - Further , as shown in Figure 4c of the appendix , tSNE visualization of the fine-tuning with GPT * is less discriminative than that of Bi-tuning , which indicates that the 'plain ' contrastive loss intuitively conflicts with the standard cross-entropy loss . - Specifically , the `` plain '' contrastive loss will push each data point apart from the others ( * i.e . * , even points of the same class should be drawn far apart ) , while the standard cross-entropy loss will pull data points of the same class to be on the same side of its hyperplane . Conflict happens because we will come up with large dispersion within each class . By seamlessly incorporating the class information into the proposed losses , such a conflict is readily resolved . * * Q : Why only compared to the baselines reproduced by this paper . * * - We mainly follow the experiment settings in ( Chen et al. , 2019 ) , which has released a complete code . - There are two reasons that we can not directly compare the results to * SpotTune * ( Guo et al. , 2018 ) : 1 . Different experiment settings and implementation protocols : - * SpotTune * uses the fine-tuned network as well as the pre-trained network for inference , which implies that the volume of parameters is doubled . This is not common since in practice , we usually use the fine-tuned network for inference . - * SpotTune * uses the protocol of ten-crop prediction in the testing phase for all of its compared methods , leading to a generally higher accuracy . 2.Missing details for evaluating * SpotTune * on our experiment settings : - * SpotTune * applies different data augmentations for different datasets without explaining the implementation details . Also , it does not provide the details of the hyper-parameters . - We notice that the authors did not provide a complete code of * SpotTune * ( only ResNet-26 on a fraction of the datasets are available ) , so we can not produce its results using our experiment settings . - Compared to ( Chen et al. , 2019 ) , our evaluation protocols are fair to all competitors . 1.All methods are evaluated using exactly the same protocol : PyTorch 's builtin data augmentation and one-crop prediction . We believe this protocol is more commonly used , and we do not over-tailor all the methods to these common tricks . 2.We use the same learning rate strategy for all methods : 5-fold cross-validation on the training set to select learning rate from { $ 10^ { -1 } ,10^ { -1.5 } ,10^ { -2 } ,10^ { -2.5 } ,10^ { -3 } ,10^ { -3.5 } ,10^ { -4 } ,10^ { -4.5 } ,10^ { -5 } $ } . This parameter tuning is a standard practice in fine-tuning . * * Q : Detailed explanation of Figure 3 * * Figure 3 is a set of attention maps attained by a visualization tool which shows discriminative localization ( Fong et al. , 2017 ) . We infer that supervised pre-training will obtain representations focusing on the discriminative part and ignoring the background part as shown in Figure 3 ( c ) . In contrast , unsupervised pre-training pays uninformative attention to every location of an input as shown in Figure 3 ( d ) . We hypothesize that this phenomenon may contribute to effective performance when fine-tuning to downstream tasks that focus more on fine-grained local information .

The paper builds on the intuition that both class discriminative information and intrinsic structure of the downstream task are useful for fine-tuning , and existing fine-tuning approaches only use the former . The authors conduct experiments on four image classification datasets , using a modern ResNet-50 architecture . == Pros == - The authors use two contrastive losses during fine-tuning , which has not been deeply explored , since most works typically use only class cross-entropy loss . One contrastive loss acts on the classification head , while the second , an extension of InfoNCE , acts on a projection head ( on top of the representation layer ) . - The proposed method achieves very good results across the four image classification datasets ( CUB , Cars , Aircraft and a custom version of MS-COCO ) , using both supervised and unsupervised pre-training . The authors perform 5 runs for each experiment and report the average as well as statistical significance metrics ( although it 's not clear if the provided interval is standard deviation or a confidence interval ) . - When using unsupervised pre-training , the authors explored 6 different pre-training algorithms , and Bi-tuning improves the standard supervised fine-tuning in all cases . - The authors also show that their method outperforms 4 baselines : standard ( supervised ) fine-tuning , BSS , DELTA , and L2SP by a significant margin across different data sizes available for fine-tuning ( 25 % , 50 % , 75 % and 100 % of the original dataset size ) . - Despite the fact that they have three terms in the final loss , no additional hyper-parameter needs to be introduced ( in addition to choosing the number of keys , which depends on the amount of training data ) . == Cons == - Despite the fact that contrastive losses have not been widely used for fine-tuning ( as far as this reviewer is aware ) , the authors should probably tone-down statements such as `` Bi-tuning , a general learning framework to fine-tuning both supervised and unsupervised pre-trained representations to downstream tasks '' . There 's a plethora of works using multiple loss/regularization terms during fine-tuning , such as DELTA or BSS , which the authors compare to . The proposed work only proposes a different type of loss/regularization . One could even argue that `` Bi-tuning '' is only a particular instance of multi-task learning . - The authors could have run additional experiments with other modern deep neural network architectures alternative to the ResNet50 ( Inception , EfficientNet , DenseNet , AmoebaNet , etc . ) to show whether the benefits transfer to other architectures . - The fact that the authors coined the method `` Bi-tuning '' but the loss has three terms ( CE , CCE and CCL ) is confusing . Probably , the `` Bi '' is due to the two heads , but still . == Typos == The paper contains several typos and some parts are not clear or could be improved , please read it carefully , correct them . Some typos that I 've found . - Not a typo , but you should indicate whether intervals in Tables are +/- std . deviation or confidence intervals . - Not a typo , but there are much earlier works showing that fine-tuning ( usually ) performs better than training from-scratch .

I do n't understand the phrase after the comma . - `` SimClR '' - > `` SimCLR '' in Table 4 . - The result of Bi-training with MoCov2 ( Table 4 ) is not statistically significant than the supervised baseline , thus it should not be bolded . == Reasons for score == The authors show that the proposed method achieves significantly better results than strong baselines across multiple datasets , data set sizes , pre-training paradigms ( supervised vs. unsupervised ) and algorithms . Despite introducing an additional head and two additional losses during fine-tuning , the proposed algorithm does not introduce more hyper-parameters than other alternatives , which makes it easier to be applied by other researchers .

Is n't adding these three values a `` naive combination '' ? If the core idea is only improved the loss function , I think such novelty is limited . - Considering the comprehensive experiments , a deeper analysis of the proposed method would have been nice . The idea of novel categorical contrastive loss $ L_ { CCL } $ on the projector head , expanding the scope of positive keys to a set of instances , what kind of scope ? What effect will the scope change have on the result ? The author stated that `` resulting in more harmonious cooperation between the supervised and unsupervised learning mechanisms '' , some form of theoretical/analytical reasoning behind the effectiveness would provide greater insights into the community and facilitate further research in this direction . - The claim of the 10.7\\ % absolute rise on CUB with a sampling rate of 25\\ % mentioned in the abstract has not been clearly addressed and pointed out in the results section of the paper . From Table 1 , I do n't know how to calculate the 10.7\\ % * * absolute rise * * . Do you actually mean the * * relative rise * * including * the margin of error * ? - Fig 3 : Why interpretable ? The author stated that `` The visualization shows that MoCo focuses only on local details . `` , I do n't understand how Fig 3 ( d ) expresses local features . What 's more , Fig 3 was quoted many times in the paper , such as sections 2.3 and 5.2 , but I really do n't understand the connection with Fig 3 . - In section 5.3 , the author stated `` It is worth mentioning that CCE and CCL can work independently of CE '' , why not set up experiments for CCE and CCL is independent ? Minor comments : * In Section 5.2 , `` As reported in Figure 3 '' , the link of Fig 3 is an error . * The labels of the figures and tables in the paper should preferably appear and quote in order .", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "Thanks for your insightful review . We will address your comments through both feedback and revision . * * Q : Novelty and naive combination of the losses : * * - The statement `` The naive combination of the supervised cross-entropy loss and the unsupervised contrastive loss is not an optimal solution for fine-tuning '' is referred to the widely-used GPT-style combination : jointly optimizing the loss used in pre-training stage ( unsupervised contrastive loss here ) and the loss of downstream task ( cross-entropy for classification ) . - In the experiment section , we have evaluated that straightforward combination of contrastive loss + cross-entropy for fine-tuning . As shown in the * * GPT\\ * * * row of Table 3 , the inclusion of `` plain '' contrastive loss is unsatisfactory . The proposed Bi-tuning outperforms the `` plain '' method by $ 3.90\\ % $ on average . - Further , as shown in Figure 4c of the appendix , the tSNE visualization of fine-tuning with * * GPT * * * is less discriminative than that of Bi-tuning , which indicates intuitively that the `` plain '' contrastive loss conflicts with the standard cross-entropy loss . - Specifically , the `` plain '' contrastive loss will push each data point apart from the others , while the standard cross-entropy loss will pull close the data points of the same class . Conflict happens . By seamlessly incorporating the class information into the proposed losses , such a conflict is readily resolved . - This paper embeds the idea of contrastive learning into the fine-tuning stage in a dual-head architecture and applies two newly designed contrast-based losses that tailor better to downstream classification tasks . In particular , $ L_\\text { CCE } $ is a novel idea to integrate contrast into cross-entropy loss . * * Q : What is the scope you apply contrasts * * - We expend Section 3 , providing more insights into our proposed losses . Here we further clarify that , besides the contrasts constructed from data augmentations , we further expand the scope of positive keys using all the instances from the same class to the query . * * Q : 10.7 % absolute rise * * - This statement refers to Table 3 . When fine-tuning MoCo ( ResNet-50 ) to CUB with 25 % data , we achieve 10.7 % absolute rise . We will clarify these misleading statements in the revision . * * Q : Visualization in Figure 3 * * - Thanks for your detailed reviews ; we fix some wrong links to Figure 3 . - Figure 3 is a set of attention maps attained by a visualization tool which shows discriminative localization ( Fong et al. , 2017 ) . We infer that supervised pre-training will obtain representations focusing on the discriminative part and ignoring the background part as shown in Figure 3 ( c ) . In contrast , unsupervised pre-training pays uninformative attention to every location of an input as shown in Figure 3 ( d ) . We hypothesize that this phenomenon may contribute to effective performance when fine-tuning to downstream tasks that focus more on fine-grained local information . And the attention maps of Bi-tuning in Figure 3 ( e ) indicate that fine-tuning to classification task is more similar to supervised pre-training than to unsupervised pre-training . * * Q : Set up experiments for CCE and CCL independently * * - Our ablations reveal that using CCE and CCL simultaneously without CE can obtain a comparable result . We can not use CCL alone because it is only performed on the projector head and does not directly supervise the classifier . CCE can work in place of the conventional CE loss but shows no obvious superiority over CE . So we tend to recommend using CCE and CCL simultaneously to boost CE loss ."}, "1": {"review_id": "3rRgu7OGgBI-1", "review_text": "Summary : The authors propose to augment the regular fine-tuning stage by two additional loss : a contrastive cross-entropy loss ( L_CCE ) and a categorical contrastive learning loss ( L_CCL ) . For each input example , L_CCE minimizes the relative distance between its representation and the softmax linear weight ( compared to the distance between another image from the same class and the linear weight ) . L_CCl encourages representations from the same class to stay close with each other . Empirical results on CUB , Cars , Aircraft and COCO-70 show the advantage of the method . Strength : 1 . Exploring the intrinsic structure of the downstream task is an interesting direction to improve transfer learning performance . 2.The proposed method shows consistent improvements across various datasets . Weakness : The additional loss terms are not well-motivated and difficulty to justify . How do they help the model exploit the intrinsic data structure ? a.In Eq3 , L_CCE computes the log ratio between { the distance between the representation h_ { i } ^ { q } and the weight of the true class w_ { y_i } } and the sum of { the distance between the positive key set h_ { j } ^ { k } and the weight of the true class w_ { y_i } } What does this log ratio term represent ? The numerator can be bigger than the denominator in this case ( and then the log term will be negative ) . Also if you just want to encourage instances from the same class to stay closer in the representation space , why do n't you just explicitly minimize the L2 distance between the representation and the prototype ? b.The goal of L_CCL is to encourage examples from the same class to stay closer with each other . Since the positive and negative sets are constructed using the label information , I do n't see how it is complimentary to the original cross entropy loss . Also , in the case where the size of the positive set |S_i| is bigger than one , equation 4 may not make much sense as there are positive examples in the denominator . Maybe I missed or misunderstood something , but based on these questions and concerns , I found it hard to justify the improvement .", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "Thanks for your detailed comments . We reorganize Section 4 in our new revision . We also rewrite the formulas in a more readable manner to clarify any possible confusion . * * Q * * : Why there are positive examples contributing to the denominator in $ L\\_\\text { CCL } $ and $ L\\_\\text { CCE } $ : The straightforward approach to expand the standard contrastive loss ( $ L\\_ { \\text { InfoNCE } } $ ) into a form of multi-positives ( denoted by a positive key set $ { |\\mathbf { K } \\_p| } $ ) is $ $ { L ' } \\_\\text { InfoNCE } =-\\frac { 1 } { |\\mathbf { K } \\_p| } \\sum\\_ { \\mathbf { k } \\_ { + } \\in \\mathbf { K } \\_p } \\log\\frac { \\exp ( \\mathbf { q } \\cdot \\mathbf { k } \\_ { + } /\\tau ) } { \\exp ( \\mathbf { q } \\cdot \\mathbf { k } \\_ { + } /\\tau ) +\\sum\\_ { \\mathbf { k } \\_ { - } \\in { \\mathbf { K } \\_n } } \\exp ( \\mathbf { q } \\cdot \\mathbf { k } \\_ { - } /\\tau ) } $ $ where $ { |\\mathbf { K } \\_n| } $ denotes the negative key set . We denote this loss function by $ { L ' } \\_\\text { InfoNCE } $ , which essentially performs multiple * * individual * * contrasts with different positive keys for each query $ q $ . The losses ( $ L\\_\\text { CCL } $ and $ L\\_\\text { CCE } $ ) we proposed are based on the following formula : $ $ L\\_ { \\text { proposed } } =-\\frac { 1 } { |\\mathbf K\\_p| } \\sum\\_ { \\mathbf { k } \\_ { + } \\in \\mathbf K\\_p } \\log\\frac { \\exp ( \\mathbf { q } \\cdot \\mathbf { k } \\_ { + } /\\tau ) } { \\sum\\_ { k^+\\in \\mathbf K\\_p } \\exp ( \\mathbf { q } \\cdot \\mathbf { k } \\_ { + } /\\tau ) +\\sum\\_ { \\mathbf { k } \\_ { - } \\in { \\mathbf K\\_n } } \\exp ( \\mathbf { q } \\cdot \\mathbf { k } \\_ { - } /\\tau ) } $ $ Different from $ { L ' } \\_\\text { InfoNCE } $ , in the denominator of $ L\\_ { \\text { proposed } } $ , both the positive keys in the same class with the query and the negative keys from other classes are presented . For each contrast with multiple positive keys , a query here needs to * balance * all positive keys simultaneously . In another view , $ L\\_ { \\text { proposed } } $ can be regarded as performing cross-entropy on soft labels of uniform probability $ \\frac { 1 } { |\\mathbf K\\_p| } $ for each positive key . $ L\\_\\text { proposed } $ introduces a * uninformative prior * that the positive keys are uniformly distributed around the query . We discuss these two forms ( $ { L ' } \\_\\text { InfoNCE } $ and $ L\\_ { \\text { proposed } } $ ) in the revision and conduct them on CUB datasets with $ 100 $ % data . $ L\\_\\text { proposed } $ yields more accuracy gains than $ { L ' } \\_\\text { InfoNCE } $ . | CUB 100 % | Fine-tuning | Bi-tuning with $ { L ' } _\\text { InfoNCE } $ | Bi-tuning with $ L_ { \\text { proposed } } $ | | -- | -- | - | | | Accuracy | 80.74 | 81.20 | 82.93 | * * Q : How is $ L\\_ { \\text { CCL } } $ complimentary to the original $ L\\_\\text { CE } $ : * * The two losses have the following fundamental distinction : - Through standard cross-entropy loss $ L\\_\\text { CE } $ , we will learn a hyperplane for discriminating each class from the other classes , and the instances of each class are only required to be far away from its associated hyperplanethey are not required to form into a compact structure in the metric space . - Through the proposed categorical contrastive loss $ L\\_ { \\text { CCL } } $ , besides requiring the instances of each class to stay far away from those of the other classes , we further require that they should form a compact structure in the metric space where each is close to the other . This is exactly the advantage of * contrast-by-metric * over * far-from-hyperplane * . - Hence , the proposed $ L\\_ { \\text { CCL } } $ can be complimentary to the original $ L\\_\\text { CE } $ . * * Q : $ L\\_ { \\text { CCE } } $ clarification : * * - Except for the way of computing the logits , $ L\\_\\text { CCE } $ has similar form as $ L\\_\\text { proposed } $ . As the numerator term also appears in the denominator , the fraction will be never larger than $ 1 $ . Overall $ L\\_\\text { CCE } $ is an interesting hybrid of $ L\\_\\text { CE } $ and $ L\\_\\text { InfoNCE } $ . The log term is introduced due to the cross-entropy over the softmax-based probability . - $ L\\_\\text { CCE } $ ( Eq.3 ) can be regarded as a dual view of the conventional cross-entropy loss $ L\\_ { \\text { CE } } $ ( Eq.2 ) .As revealed in Figure 1 , to find the correct class , $ L\\_\\text { CCE } $ performs column-wise championship while $ L\\_ { \\text { CE } } $ performs row-wise championship . Further , instead of operating loss computation along the class dimension ( * i.e . * number of classes ) , $ L\\_\\text { CCE } $ operates along the key-set dimension ( $ K+1 $ ) . Further , if we regard $ L\\_ { \\text { CE } } $ as a class-wise championship , then $ L\\_\\text { CCE } $ can be regarded as an instance-wise championship . - Experiments in Table 3 show that minimizing the $ L\\_2 $ distance between the representation space and the class prototype only brings limited benefits , as shown in the * * Center * * ( a.k.a.the center loss which assumes Gaussian for each class ) row of the table . Bi-tuning outperforms these competitors significantly ."}, "2": {"review_id": "3rRgu7OGgBI-2", "review_text": "# # # Summary The paper suggests to extend fine-tuning of pre-trained representations by adding additional contrastive losses to leverage the intrinsic structure of the downstream training data . The authors call the presented method Bi-tuning and evaluate it by comparing it to other variants of fine-tuning . # # # Quality , clarity , originality and significance The paper describes its motivation well , and Sections 1 and 2 are well-written and clear . Sections 3 , 4 , and especially 5 , I found less clear and in some parts a bit confusing . One point that I found not entirely clear in the motivation is the focus on the conjunction of * fine-tuning * and * supervised contrastive learning * . Others have looked at the latter for general training , e.g . [ arXiv:2004.11362 ] ( https : //arxiv.org/pdf/2004.11362.pdf ) or [ arXiv:1808.04699 ] ( https : //arxiv.org/pdf/1808.04699.pdf ) , so it is not clear to me why the Bi-tuning loss is restricted ( in this study ) to fine-tuning only . If the loss is universally applicable , should n't it also work for training in general ? Or if there is a reason to not expect this ( i.e.to expect that it should only work well with pre-training ) this should be explained ( or the explanation emphasized if I missed it ) . If the focus is on bringing contrastive learning to the fine-tuning stage , then maybe an inclusion of some more `` plain '' contrastive losses on the way to the `` novel '' loss introduced here may lead to a better understanding , focusing specifically on the fine-tuning stage . The experimental results look good at first glance , but overall I found it hard to evaluate how convincing they are because of several potential problems : * The experimental results are not compared to any results from the existing literature , all baselines and comparisons are entirely from this paper . This makes it hard to know how much careful tuning went into the proposed algorithm versus the baselines . I think at least * some * comparison to results from the literature should be possible or it should be carefully explained why such an overfitting to the proposed algorithm clearly did not happen . For example , the [ SpotTune paper ] ( https : //www.cs.utexas.edu/~grauman/papers/CVPR19_spottune.pdf ) contains numbers for CUBS and Cars that look comparable at first glance because they also use pre-trained ResNet-50 models , and they include numbers for L2-SP that are better than the ones in this paper . It may be very insightful to compare results to these or other similar results . There seems to be some overlap with methods/datasets to ( Chen et al. , 2019 ) , but then again there are differences like the percentages of data samples . * There are a lot of seemingly random choices in the selection of the datasets , e.g.why CUB/Cars/Aircraft and not e.g.CIFAR , Dogs , Pets , Flowers , or Birds ? I 'm not saying any of these choices are inherently better , but the authors should explain * why * these datasets are chosen , to avoid the impression that the datasets may have been chosen because the proposed method works particularly well on these dataset combinations . One way to make the results stronger would therefore be to use combinations of datasets that other , previous work has already used , which would also enable a direct comparison ( see above ) . * Again in a similar fashion , Table 4 evaluates only one target data set , why only this one ? # # # Pros and cons * Pros : interesting exploration of fine-tuning with added contrastive losses * Cons : experimental results not very convincing , main message is not very clear # # # Minor details and comments * Novelty of the presented components seemed a bit overstated to me in some parts . E.g.words like `` improved '' , `` novel '' , `` newly-designed '' are used throughout the work when it is not entirely clear ( at least to me ) where exactly the novelty lies . * `` the best learning rate is selected by cross-validation under a 100 % sampling rate and applied to all four sampling rates . '' - how exactly is the cross-validation performed here ? * Sec.5.1 . does not seem to specify the pretraining dataset . I assume it 's ImageNet , but giving some specifics ( e.g.was a particular publicly available checkpoint used ) might be helpful . * `` Previous fine-tuning methods mainly focus on improving performance under low-data regime paradigms . '' It seems recently there are several works using fine-tuning to ImageNet , which may count as large-scale , too ? E.g . [ PapersWithCode-ImageNet ] ( https : //paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-imagenet ) has several approaches near the top-performing methods that would fall into that category I think . * Figure 2 ( b ) : performance seems not yet saturated going to higher dimensionality - would it make sense to go even higher ? * Figure 3 is very hard to interpret I think and it is only explained extremely briefly by citing a reference . Why is the visualization uniform in case ( d ) ? What does the visualization show ? Which model and data were used ? Also the conclusion `` Bi-tuning in 3 ( e ) captures both local details and global category-structures '' is not evident from the figure alone , I think it may need more explanation and interpretation .", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We appreciate your detailed comments . We have conducted more experiments following your suggestions and appended them to the revision . * * Q : The focus of this paper * * - We clarify that this paper focuses on the fine-tuning stage since fine-tuning is one of the most classical and popular paradigms of transfer learning . - As for pre-training , the proposed contrastive losses can not apply to unsupervised pre-training due to the requirement of labeled data . We agree with the reviewer that , while out of the scope of the current paper , exploring the proposed losses in the supervised pre-training stage or general training is a promising future research direction . - In the experiment section , we have evaluated that straightforward combination of contrastive loss with fine-tuning , i.e.the inclusion of `` plain '' contrastive loss as mentioned by the reviewer , is unsatisfactory ( see the * GPT * * row in Table 3 ) . The proposed Bi-tuning outperforms the `` plain '' method by 3.90 % on average . - Further , as shown in Figure 4c of the appendix , tSNE visualization of the fine-tuning with GPT * is less discriminative than that of Bi-tuning , which indicates that the 'plain ' contrastive loss intuitively conflicts with the standard cross-entropy loss . - Specifically , the `` plain '' contrastive loss will push each data point apart from the others ( * i.e . * , even points of the same class should be drawn far apart ) , while the standard cross-entropy loss will pull data points of the same class to be on the same side of its hyperplane . Conflict happens because we will come up with large dispersion within each class . By seamlessly incorporating the class information into the proposed losses , such a conflict is readily resolved . * * Q : Why only compared to the baselines reproduced by this paper . * * - We mainly follow the experiment settings in ( Chen et al. , 2019 ) , which has released a complete code . - There are two reasons that we can not directly compare the results to * SpotTune * ( Guo et al. , 2018 ) : 1 . Different experiment settings and implementation protocols : - * SpotTune * uses the fine-tuned network as well as the pre-trained network for inference , which implies that the volume of parameters is doubled . This is not common since in practice , we usually use the fine-tuned network for inference . - * SpotTune * uses the protocol of ten-crop prediction in the testing phase for all of its compared methods , leading to a generally higher accuracy . 2.Missing details for evaluating * SpotTune * on our experiment settings : - * SpotTune * applies different data augmentations for different datasets without explaining the implementation details . Also , it does not provide the details of the hyper-parameters . - We notice that the authors did not provide a complete code of * SpotTune * ( only ResNet-26 on a fraction of the datasets are available ) , so we can not produce its results using our experiment settings . - Compared to ( Chen et al. , 2019 ) , our evaluation protocols are fair to all competitors . 1.All methods are evaluated using exactly the same protocol : PyTorch 's builtin data augmentation and one-crop prediction . We believe this protocol is more commonly used , and we do not over-tailor all the methods to these common tricks . 2.We use the same learning rate strategy for all methods : 5-fold cross-validation on the training set to select learning rate from { $ 10^ { -1 } ,10^ { -1.5 } ,10^ { -2 } ,10^ { -2.5 } ,10^ { -3 } ,10^ { -3.5 } ,10^ { -4 } ,10^ { -4.5 } ,10^ { -5 } $ } . This parameter tuning is a standard practice in fine-tuning . * * Q : Detailed explanation of Figure 3 * * Figure 3 is a set of attention maps attained by a visualization tool which shows discriminative localization ( Fong et al. , 2017 ) . We infer that supervised pre-training will obtain representations focusing on the discriminative part and ignoring the background part as shown in Figure 3 ( c ) . In contrast , unsupervised pre-training pays uninformative attention to every location of an input as shown in Figure 3 ( d ) . We hypothesize that this phenomenon may contribute to effective performance when fine-tuning to downstream tasks that focus more on fine-grained local information .

The paper builds on the intuition that both class discriminative information and intrinsic structure of the downstream task are useful for fine-tuning , and existing fine-tuning approaches only use the former . The authors conduct experiments on four image classification datasets , using a modern ResNet-50 architecture . == Pros == - The authors use two contrastive losses during fine-tuning , which has not been deeply explored , since most works typically use only class cross-entropy loss . One contrastive loss acts on the classification head , while the second , an extension of InfoNCE , acts on a projection head ( on top of the representation layer ) . - The proposed method achieves very good results across the four image classification datasets ( CUB , Cars , Aircraft and a custom version of MS-COCO ) , using both supervised and unsupervised pre-training . The authors perform 5 runs for each experiment and report the average as well as statistical significance metrics ( although it 's not clear if the provided interval is standard deviation or a confidence interval ) . - When using unsupervised pre-training , the authors explored 6 different pre-training algorithms , and Bi-tuning improves the standard supervised fine-tuning in all cases . - The authors also show that their method outperforms 4 baselines : standard ( supervised ) fine-tuning , BSS , DELTA , and L2SP by a significant margin across different data sizes available for fine-tuning ( 25 % , 50 % , 75 % and 100 % of the original dataset size ) . - Despite the fact that they have three terms in the final loss , no additional hyper-parameter needs to be introduced ( in addition to choosing the number of keys , which depends on the amount of training data ) . == Cons == - Despite the fact that contrastive losses have not been widely used for fine-tuning ( as far as this reviewer is aware ) , the authors should probably tone-down statements such as `` Bi-tuning , a general learning framework to fine-tuning both supervised and unsupervised pre-trained representations to downstream tasks '' . There 's a plethora of works using multiple loss/regularization terms during fine-tuning , such as DELTA or BSS , which the authors compare to . The proposed work only proposes a different type of loss/regularization . One could even argue that `` Bi-tuning '' is only a particular instance of multi-task learning . - The authors could have run additional experiments with other modern deep neural network architectures alternative to the ResNet50 ( Inception , EfficientNet , DenseNet , AmoebaNet , etc . ) to show whether the benefits transfer to other architectures . - The fact that the authors coined the method `` Bi-tuning '' but the loss has three terms ( CE , CCE and CCL ) is confusing . Probably , the `` Bi '' is due to the two heads , but still . == Typos == The paper contains several typos and some parts are not clear or could be improved , please read it carefully , correct them . Some typos that I 've found . - Not a typo , but you should indicate whether intervals in Tables are +/- std . deviation or confidence intervals . - Not a typo , but there are much earlier works showing that fine-tuning ( usually ) performs better than training from-scratch . In the introduction you cite He et al . ( 2019 ) .A quick search on the Internet yields a survey from 2009 on the topic , for example . - Equation 1 , bold q , k_+ and k_i , since these denote vectors . - Figure 1 , missing h_0^k ( according to equation 3 , j starts at 0 ) . - `` Previously , we propose '' - > `` Previously , we proposed '' . - `` As shown in 1 '' - > `` As shown in Table 1 '' . - `` Results in Table 2 reveal that Bi-tuning brings general gains for all tasks , even provided with sufficient training data '' . I do n't understand the phrase after the comma . - `` SimClR '' - > `` SimCLR '' in Table 4 . - The result of Bi-training with MoCov2 ( Table 4 ) is not statistically significant than the supervised baseline , thus it should not be bolded . == Reasons for score == The authors show that the proposed method achieves significantly better results than strong baselines across multiple datasets , data set sizes , pre-training paradigms ( supervised vs. unsupervised ) and algorithms . Despite introducing an additional head and two additional losses during fine-tuning , the proposed algorithm does not introduce more hyper-parameters than other alternatives , which makes it easier to be applied by other researchers . This reviewer believes that some claims are a bit overstated ( e.g.claiming that the proposed approach is a `` framework '' ) , but there 's no doubt that the proposed algorithm achieves excellent results and the experimental work is solid .", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "reply_text": "We thank you for your encouraging feedback and constructive suggestions . * * Q : Possibly overstate * * We have revised the paper accordingly by replacing 'framework ' with 'approach ' . * * Q : Additional experiments with other modern deep neural network architectures * * - As a fine-tuning method , Bi-tuning is based on the publicly available pre-trained models , in which ResNet is the most popular architecture and has pre-trained models for different pre-training methods and datasets .
