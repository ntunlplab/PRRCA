The difference is small enough that in practice it is very hard for me to believe that many researchers would choose to use the meta-learning via deep RL method (given that they'd need to train on multiple datasets and tune REINFORCE which is not going to be obviously easy). For that reason I am inclined to reject the paper.\n\nIn a follow-up version, I would heed the advice of Reviewer 1 and do more ablation analyses to understand the value of myopic vs non-myopic, cross-dataset vs. not, bandits vs RL, on the fly vs not (these are all intermingled issues). The relative lack of such analyses in the paper does not help in terms of it passing the bar.", "reviews": [{"review_id": "HJ4IhxZAb-0", "review_text": "The approach solves an important problem as getting labelled data is hard. The focus is on the key aspect, which is generalisation across heteregeneous data. The novel idea is the dataset embedding so that their RL policy can be trained to work across diverse datasets.

In particular, they alsoevaluated on test datasets with fairly different statistics from the training datasets, which isnt very common in most meta-learning papers today, so it\u2019s encouraging that the method works in that regime. Cons: 1. The embedding strategy, especially the representative and discriminative histograms, is complicated. It is unclear if the strategy is general enough to work on harder problems / larger datasets, or with higher dimensional data like images. More evidence in the paper for why it would work on harder problems would be great. 2. The policy network would have to output a probability for each datapoint in the dataset U, which could be fairly large, thus the method is computationally much more expensive than random sampling.

Histogram Embedding Motivation : The general idea of a histogram-based embedding was inspired by Romero ICLR'17 . We customised it for application to AL here . For example , the representative embedding encodes information about the spread of the dataset itself ( unlabelled component ) and the spread of the queries so far ( labelled component ) . While the discriminative embedding contains information about how the current leaner certainty varies with the position of an instance within the spread of the dataset ( through encoding posterior certainty jointly with position ) . Convergence : Yes the policy is stabilising . This is now illustrated in Appendix Sec 7.1 , Fig 3 . Fixed budget : AL is mainly of interest in settings when a small budget must be carefully spent . We agree extending to budgets of 100 or more is within the interesting range . But we leave this for future work as we did n't have time to run these experiments yet . 2D histogram : To clarify : Each feature dimension of input is encoded by a joint histogram counting : ( 1 ) The frequency of instances with a value of that feature within each bin and ( 2 ) The frequency of instances with a given posterior probability according to the base classifier so far ( IE : binning on the base classifier 's probability value between [ 0,1 ] that the given instance is class +1 vs class -1 ) . We clarified this in Sec 3.1 . Explain A ( Z ) : This is the MSE of reconstruction of the instances by the autoencoder . Now clarified in Sec 3.2 . Quantitative Comparison . Myopic/ALBL : The reviewer mentioned they would like evidence of RL policy benefit vs myopic bandit learner . We would like to reiterate that the mentioned point here is only one out of two contributions here . We perform non-myopic learning with RL , but the second contribution is the learning of cross-dataset generalisation which is not attempted at all in prior work such as Chu and Lin 's ALBL . We have now added ALBL to the experimental comparison , ( as well as QBB suggested by R3 ) . We can see that MLP-GAL is clearly better than ALBL in the updated Tables 1 and 2 . To understand why : Recall that ALBL performs bandit-based learning within-dataset without knowledge transfer . Its underlying bandit learner is designed for asymptotic performance . In the few-shot scenario of active learning , it suffers critically from the fundamental explore/exploit dilemma . ALBL must use the limited active queries to do exploration for learning . By the time it has explored enough to define a good learner , it has a small active query budget remaining to exploit this knowledge . This is particularly detrimental in our tough setting of only 20 queries per dataset . In contrast by doing cross-dataset transfer , our MLP-GAL completely avoids this limitation . It gets all its learning done on different source datasets and can go straight to `` exploiting '' when tested on a novel dataset . Quantitative comparison . Adaptive learning on the Fly : We assume the reviewer is referring to the meta-network in this question . The relevant comparison is then between MLP-GAL and Single-RL which is trained in a similar multi-task way , but excludes the meta-network that helps the policy adapt to new target datasets . We can see that MLP-GAL outperform Single-RL in the results ( Tab 1 , and more clearly in Tab 2 ) . This is despite that the latter adds significantly more expert features in order to make it approximate a non-myopic RL-upgraded version of the expert feature-based supervised learner in Konyushkova et al , NIPS , 2017 . RL Approach chosen : For simplicity we chose PG , as the simplest classic direct policy search method . More advanced methods ( actor-critic , TRPO , etc ) could be potentially used to further improve performance . We tried DQN-based Q-learning and it did not work as well due to being hard to stabilise the training . We believe Q-learning should also work in principle but may be more sensitive to tuning hyperparameters for good stability .
