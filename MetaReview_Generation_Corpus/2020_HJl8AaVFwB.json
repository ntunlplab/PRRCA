Also found their extension of previous single read metagenomic classification models with DeepSets and attentional pooling layers to be well explained. However, there are two significant flaws that unfortunately make this paper incomplete as written: 1) The abstract states that this paper will \"attempt to solve the task of directly predicting the distribution over the taxa of whole metagenomic read sets\". However, \"whole metagenomic read sets\" typically contain many millions of reads, whereas the maximum bag size explored in this paper is 2048. The authors never explain how their MIL metagenomic model should be applied to a full metagenomic sequencing dataset. Should the MIL model be applied to random 2048 read subsets of the many-million read real world datasets? Should these bags of reads be sampled with or without replacement? And, when applied to a whole metagenomic read set, are the improvements in classification accuracy observed for 2048 read bags recapitulated? 2) There is no comparison to standard metagenomic classification tools such as Kraken and Centrifuge. While previous work such as GeNet have compared to these tools the read generation and testing assumptions in this paper are not identical. Also, GeNet was found to be inferior to Kraken and Centrifuge in many scenarios, it would be good to know where in the spectrum of accuracy these new models fall. Update: Having read the rebuttal, my review stands. This paper will be much better once the authors add in estimation from full read sets and evaluate against standard tools. Presumably that will have to be for a future conference submission.

In the simpler case of DeepSets , the sum can be decomposed to a sum of sums . In other words , we can process 2048 reads at a time up to and including the MIL pooling phase and 'pause ' processing there in order to get a representation for each subset of reads . We can then sum all the representations together to get a vector representation for the whole readset and continue with the execution of the rest of the network . Since we can accumulate the representations into a single vector instead of storing each individual subset representation , we can avoid any potential GPU memory issues we would have with a much larger readset . A similar , albeit less efficient , decomposition can be done for the attention-based pooling . For example , one could first calculate the numerator \\exp ( w^T \\tanh ( V x_k^T ) ) ( Eq.7 in the paper ) for each read ( processing 2048 reads a time ) . All the numerators need to be stored since these values need to be normalized to be between 0 and 1 . Storing the numerators can be done in a secondary GPU or RAM where no other parameters of the model are stored . Normalization is then done in the secondary GPU and a single vector representing the weighted average can be transferred back to the main GPU for further processing by the remaining layers of the network . Following this approach , no additional randomness or noise is introduced to the model through sampling with/without replacement .
