We address the concerns as follows . 1.As for the depth dependence , the stability result ( Theorem 1 ) shows that the forward and backward processes are stable if the width $ m $ scales with $ \\log L $ while a similar result for vanilla feedforward network ( Allen-Zhu et al.2018 ) requires the width $ m $ scales at least with $ L\\log L $ . The convergence result ( Theorem 4 ) states that the depth dependence is polynomial with $ L $ , which comes only from the semi-smoothness characterization ( Theorem 6 ) . As we discussed in the paragraph after Theorem 6 , the depth dependence term in the semi-smoothness characterization is relatively small to other terms under the over-parameterized regime e.g. $ m > L $ ( we note that this does not mean that $ m $ scales with $ L $ linearly ) . Hence the depth dependence in the convergence result is much weaker than the case of feedforward network . For experiments , we tried much deeper ResNet in Appendix I and the training curves is similar to that in Fig.1 as a $ \\log $ term dependence is hard to reveal in experiments . 2.It was pointed out by others that our result and proof may be used to show the spectral norm of a product of i.i.d.matrices that is called the top Lyapunov exponent , which might have interesting applications in stochastic stability in addition to the convergence analysis of gradient descent for ResNet . We believe this is suitable for future study . 3.We thank the reviewer for pointing out the typos and grammars . The paper is updated with careful grammar checking . We wish the reviewer could reconsider the evaluation of our paper if the comments are addressed well ."}}
