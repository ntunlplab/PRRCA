We answer the specific questions below , Q1 : The proposed BoN is built upon the existing SplitLBI algorithm that can identify the sparse approximation of the weight structure . The contributions are mainly from incorporating the adaptive criteria for adding filters and layers . Thus contribution is incremental and novelty is limited . A1 : Thanks . Actually not . Despite our algorithm is built upon SplitLBI , which is one of most recent optimizers , the main focus of this paper is about boosting network , i.e. , efficiently growing filters and layers of network . The goal of our paper is boosting networks , and we propose new algorithm to reveal our goal by using Split LBI as a tool . The original SplitLBI is an optimization algorithm and the usage of \\Gamma is for sparsity . We summarize the contributions : ( 1 ) A novel learning paradigm - Boosting net- work ( BoN ) , is for the first time , studied in this paper ; and one starts from simple models , delving into complex trained models progressively . ( 2 ) We propose a novel GT-filters Alg , which can si- multaneously effectively grow the filters of each layer , and train the network parameters , given an initial network . ( 3 ) We present GT-layers Alg which grows and trains layers , by exploring the over- parameterized model weight and structural sparsity model weight set . Q2 : The projection operator in equation ( 4 ) is a key step of the boosting procedure , but is not clearly defined and explained . A2 : Thanks . We add some explanations . \u201c This above equation means $ ( W^ { t } $ is projected on $ \\Gamma^ { t } $ , and the selected subset $ \\widetilde { W } ^ { t } $ include the parameters existed in both $ W^ { t } $ and $ \\Gamma^ { t } $ . \u201c Q3 : For experiments , results shows good results on simple baselines , more complicated or large-scale datasets should be included for evaluations . Also , only Autogrow is compared to the proposed method , to make the results more convincing , other architecture searching approaches ( e.g.NAS ) should be added to comparisons . A3 : Thanks . But in our paper , we demand the following properties of an algorithm qualified as BoN : ( 1 ) It should incorporate both architecture growth ( including filters and layers ) and parameter learning simultaneously , in which the width and depth of network can be gradually updated , and the parameters of network should be updated at the same time ; ( 2 ) It should provide a comparable classifier for prediction tasks , as the state-of-the-art hand- crafted architectures on the same dataset ; ( 3 ) Its computational requirements , the total parameters of final boosted network , and memory footprint should remain bounded , ideally in the same order of magnitude as training a manually engineered architecture on the same dataset . The first two criteria express the essence of boosting network ; the third criterion identifies the key difference from NAS and other trivial or brute-force solutions , such as randomly searching . As the field of representation learning moves closer towards artificial intelligence , it becomes important to efficiently and simultaneously learn both the structures and parameters of a network from arbitrary classes on mobile devices or even Internet of Things ( IoT ) devices . To sum up , the goal of our work is boosting networks in an efficient way , which is quite different from NAS , which is searching for good structure . It \u2019 s very hard for our algorithm to make a direct and far comparison to NAS , in term of GPU computational cost , and total parameters of final network structures . Q4 : For the GT-layers Alg , would it more efficient to boost layer first before boosting the filters ? A4 : Thanks . Thanks for this point . The GT-Filters Alg in GT-Layers algorithm aims at finding the optimal configuration of the filter number . Generally and practically , it is a good practice to use the same number of filters in each convolutional layer , as has done in many previous manually designed architectures . On the other hand , some of our pilot experiments suggest that , if alternatively growing filters and layers , it may greatly improve the computational cost , but do not incur significant performance improvement . Thus , the algorithm is designed as boosting filters , and then boosting layers . Q5 : Will GT-layers be robust to the case when the number of filters is overly specified ? A5 : Thanks . If the number of filters overly specified , the model may be also over-parameterized ."}, {"review_id": "SylwBpNKDr-1", "review_text": "This paper proposes an architecture search method for deep convolutional neural network models that progressively increases the number of filters per layer as well as the number of layers, and the authors refer to this general approach as boosting networks. The algorithm for increasing the number of filters is based on split linear Bregman iteration, and the algorithm for increasing the number of layers proceeds block by block, increasing the layers per block until the accuracy does not increase. The experiments convincingly demonstrate gains in performance and smaller network sizes compared to baseline models, naive boosting methods, and a related method called Autogrow. In my view, there are two main areas for further improvement for this work. First, the GT-Layers algorithm can be better motivated. Why is GT-Filters only run once at the beginning, rather than iteratively as the number of layers increases? Why does the procedure go from bottom blocks to up blocks (and, by the way, what are bottom blocks and up blocks)? Why measure training accuracy to determine when to add layers? I understand that these are all fairly heuristic choices, but nevertheless there needs to be proper motivation for all of the above. Second, an additional effort should be made to compare to additional prior work in architecture search. It seems like the authors are suggesting that this method should be more computationally efficient and find smaller architectures, and demonstrating this empirically would greatly strengthen the paper. In particular, the existing results depicting the final number of parameters in the learned model are particularly striking to me.

Q1 : The method is not clearly explained and rigorously formulated . ( Q1-1 ) what 's \u0393 ? Is it a copy of W or not ? What 's the exact mathematical function of loss L ( ) w.r.t.W and \u0393 ? How does the neural architecture change after adding \u0393 ? ( A-1 ) : Yes , we had clearly defined \\Gamma in Eq ( 3 ) . \\Gamma is the structural sparsity parameter to explore important subnetwork architectures by inverse scale space where those important parameters become nonzero faster than others . Mathematically , in Eq ( 3 ) , \\Gamma learned to approximate W but not a copy of W. Thus the \\Gamma is initialized as the same dimension as W , while most values of \\Gamma should be zeros ( sparse ) . Here W is the model parameters of deep networks . We update the loss function w.r.t W and \u0393 in the revised version ( Q1-2 ) why \u0393 can be approximated by gradients in Eq. ( 3 ) ... ( A-2 ) . Thanks.We update this point , and give more detailed mathematical definition , and intuition in the revised ( Q-3 ) why \u0393 is necessary ? How does it compare with enforcing group Lasso on W directly , like what was done in Nonparametric Neural Networks [ 1 ] ? ( A-3 ) .To efficiently boosting the network , we need the merit of learning both an over-parameterized model weight set ( Over-Par set ) as the Stochastic Gradient Descent ( SGD ) , and structural sparsity model weight set ( Stru-Spa set ) in a coupled inverse scale space . Thus the weight parameter W is for Over-Par set , and \u0393 is for structural sparsity set . Thus it is necessary to introduce \u0393 . One can enforce group lasso on W or as Nonparametric Neural Networks [ 1 ] , but we still need the structural sparsity set \u0393 , to help measure whether the filters or layers should be boosted . In that sense , the structural sparsity set selected by Nonparametric Neural Networks , can also potentially be utilized as an alternative to \u0393 ; and we take it as a future work . Q2 : Improvement on experiments . ( Q2-1 ) Include the learned width in Table 1 . ( A2-1 ) : Thanks . The learned width is actually shown in Tab 1 . Particularly , in Tab 1 of our unrevised paper , the \u201c UP-Net \u201d column describes our learned width of each network , for example , 8 @ 3 * 3 means kernel size is 3 with 8 channels we learned . We highlight this point in the revised version . ( Q2-2 ) the pairs of PlainNet is hard to judge because different neural architectures are used . AutoGrow uses 4 blocks while this paper uses 5 blocks . ... ( A2-2 ) . Thanks.For fair comparison we add one experiment on 4-blocks plainnet . It shows that our method has much less parameters while still keeps almost same performance . 4-Block-PlainNet ( J=30 , \\epsilon=0.3 , \\tau=0.5 ) : CIFAR10 : ACC-94.30 % ; Layer-16 ; Param-2.577M ; CIFAR100 : ACC-75.35 % ; Layer-15 ; Param-13.332 M ; Compared with 5-Block-PlainNet , which has the results as CIFAR10 : ACC-94.65\uff1b Layer-19 ; Param-7.70M ; CIFAR100 : ACC-75.66\uff1b Layer-18 ; Param-29.83M ; ( Q2-3 ) In the experiments of layer growing , please clarify if filter growth is also applied or not . ( A2-3 ) .In the experiments of layer growing , we do use filter growth , as explicitly explained in Sec.3.3 The detailed procedure is : 1 ) . Initialize the base network . 2 ) .Grow filters to determine appropriate channels of each block ( simply , layers between 2 pooling layers in PlainNet called a block ; and layers having same output size in ResNet called a block ) , i.e. , \u201c learning the filter configuration of each conv of each block ; \u201d 3 ) . After getting number of channels , we begin to grow layer . We further highlight this point . ( Q2-4 ) clarify `` their growing process is not efficient . '' AutoGrow is very efficiency ... ( A2-4 ) . Yes , indeed , AutoGrow is one of the most efficiency methods for the proposed BoN task ; but it is less efficient than ours . we elaborate it in the revised paper , We also empirically compare the running time : We run the source code released by the author with their default setting , and running on our single TITAN X ( Pascal ) GPU .

How critical are they ? ( A3-1 ) .For the initial number of units in linear layer , we have used other trial such as 50 , 200 , 1000 neurons , the final results do not have significant difference : the accuracy difference is < 0.02 % . And for the initial number of filters , we also tried 8 , 10 , 16 filters , the results also do not have significant difference . This is to say , the initial seed is not so critical , so we stick to 20 filters , and 100 neurons in our experiments for convenience . ( Q3-2 ) `` To the best of our knowledge , .. over-claimed .

We update the loss function w.r.t W and \u0393 in the revised version ( Q1-2 ) why \u0393 can be approximated by gradients in Eq. ( 3 ) ... ( A-2 ) . Thanks.We update this point , and give more detailed mathematical definition , and intuition in the revised ( Q-3 ) why \u0393 is necessary ? How does it compare with enforcing group Lasso on W directly , like what was done in Nonparametric Neural Networks [ 1 ] ? ( A-3 ) .To efficiently boosting the network , we need the merit of learning both an over-parameterized model weight set ( Over-Par set ) as the Stochastic Gradient Descent ( SGD ) , and structural sparsity model weight set ( Stru-Spa set ) in a coupled inverse scale space . Thus the weight parameter W is for Over-Par set , and \u0393 is for structural sparsity set . Thus it is necessary to introduce \u0393 . One can enforce group lasso on W or as Nonparametric Neural Networks [ 1 ] , but we still need the structural sparsity set \u0393 , to help measure whether the filters or layers should be boosted . In that sense , the structural sparsity set selected by Nonparametric Neural Networks , can also potentially be utilized as an alternative to \u0393 ; and we take it as a future work . Q2 : Improvement on experiments . ( Q2-1 ) Include the learned width in Table 1 . ( A2-1 ) : Thanks . The learned width is actually shown in Tab 1 . Particularly , in Tab 1 of our unrevised paper , the \u201c UP-Net \u201d column describes our learned width of each network , for example , 8 @ 3 * 3 means kernel size is 3 with 8 channels we learned . We highlight this point in the revised version . ( Q2-2 ) the pairs of PlainNet is hard to judge because different neural architectures are used . AutoGrow uses 4 blocks while this paper uses 5 blocks . ... ( A2-2 ) . Thanks.For fair comparison we add one experiment on 4-blocks plainnet . It shows that our method has much less parameters while still keeps almost same performance . 4-Block-PlainNet ( J=30 , \\epsilon=0.3 , \\tau=0.5 ) : CIFAR10 : ACC-94.30 % ; Layer-16 ; Param-2.577M ; CIFAR100 : ACC-75.35 % ; Layer-15 ; Param-13.332 M ; Compared with 5-Block-PlainNet , which has the results as CIFAR10 : ACC-94.65\uff1b Layer-19 ; Param-7.70M ; CIFAR100 : ACC-75.66\uff1b Layer-18 ; Param-29.83M ; ( Q2-3 ) In the experiments of layer growing , please clarify if filter growth is also applied or not . ( A2-3 ) .In the experiments of layer growing , we do use filter growth , as explicitly explained in Sec.3.3 The detailed procedure is : 1 ) . Initialize the base network . 2 ) .Grow filters to determine appropriate channels of each block ( simply , layers between 2 pooling layers in PlainNet called a block ; and layers having same output size in ResNet called a block ) , i.e. , \u201c learning the filter configuration of each conv of each block ; \u201d 3 ) . After getting number of channels , we begin to grow layer . We further highlight this point . ( Q2-4 ) clarify `` their growing process is not efficient . '' AutoGrow is very efficiency ... ( A2-4 ) . Yes , indeed , AutoGrow is one of the most efficiency methods for the proposed BoN task ; but it is less efficient than ours . we elaborate it in the revised paper , We also empirically compare the running time : We run the source code released by the author with their default setting , and running on our single TITAN X ( Pascal ) GPU . Autogrow on Cifar10 ( using ResNet block ) : main_gradual.py : ACC- 93.75 % ; running-time-9.74h ; main_add.py : ACC- 92.57 % ; running-time-7.36h Our method on Cifar10 : ResNet : ACC-94.60 % ; time-4.0h ; ( PlainNet : ACC-94.65 % ; time-3.0h ) Q3 : Some minor issues : ( Q3-1 ) networks with `` 20 filters '' and `` 100 neurons '' are used as the seeds . How critical are they ? ( A3-1 ) .For the initial number of units in linear layer , we have used other trial such as 50 , 200 , 1000 neurons , the final results do not have significant difference : the accuracy difference is < 0.02 % . And for the initial number of filters , we also tried 8 , 10 , 16 filters , the results also do not have significant difference . This is to say , the initial seed is not so critical , so we stick to 20 filters , and 100 neurons in our experiments for convenience . ( Q3-2 ) `` To the best of our knowledge , .. over-claimed . ( A3-2 ) .Thank . We revised the claim as suggested . [ 1 ] Huang et al. , Split LBI : An iterative regularization path with structural sparsity . NeurIPS 2016 ."}}
