The authors generate a toy dataset , in which the source-specific and transferable features are thus clearly distinguishable , for the transfer learning tasks . As both fine-tuning and joint training are not optimal solutions for the experimental dataset , they further design MeRLin , which is based on the meta-learning mechanism , to learn a generalizable model weight . * Strengths * : 1 . In order to investigate how a model ( including a feature extractor and a classifier ) interacts with the source-specific feature and transferable feature within a data , the authors generate a toy dataset and examine the effectiveness of fine-tuning and joint-training methods . This provides clear and insightful experimental observations for the further understanding of transfer feature learning . 2.The observation that the fine-tuning and the joint training tends to learn the `` convenient '' feature ( i.e. , both methods tend to learn easy source-specific feature rather than a transferable feature ) provides a reasonable argument why both models can not work well . 3.The designed meta-learning-based method is convincing empirically , as the objective function implies the model has to learn a generalizable feature extractor for loss minimization . * Weakness/comments * 1 . Although the proposed demonstrates the above observations , the connection to existing domain adaptation/domain generation works seems lacking . Some of these works also aim to learn the feature , which can be generalized to the target domain . And the source-specific feature can be also regarded as the domain shift between source and target domains ( so that it can not be generalized by using fine-tuning ) . I understand the problem settings of domain adaptation/domain generation are a bit different from the setting used in the paper , while such discussion can further improve the completeness of this paper . 2.Another weakness is the baseline methods , as these baseline methods are too simple . I am wondering about the comparison to existing works on the relevant areas ( e.g. , other general feature learning or domain-relevant works ) . 3.One reason why people use pretraining method is neglected : one does not need to access the source dataset when the target task is trained . In some practical scenarios , one can not access the large scale of source dataset ( i.e. , imagenet ) , and this limits the use of the proposed model , which requires access to source data . But this point is just a comment , not a weakness as the authors have clarified the problem scope at the beginning of the paper .

The outer optimization minimizes the loss of inner-trained network when it is used to learn a new classification head for a validation set from the target domain . The authors first motivate their work by discussing the success and failures of joint training and fine-tuning , then they use principled experiments to verify hypotheses about the failure modes of these two popular transfer methods . Thereafter , they introduce their proposed method ( MeRLin ) , provide a theoretical analysis which compares its behavior to fine-tuning and joint training in a limited problem class , and then present empirical results showing the effectiveness of MeRLin on several popular CV and NLP benchmarks . # # Pros and Cons # # # Pros * Principled approach to analyzing the failure modes of fine-tuning and joint training # # # Cons * Requiring data from the target domain during training negates many of the sought-after benefits of transfer learning ( e.g.re-using pre-trained models quickly without lengthy pre-training , adapting to unforseen new tasks , etc . ) # # Evaluation # # # Quality 3/5 The overall quality of execution of this work is high , but not flawless . The work 's laudable careful theoretical and synthetic-empirical evaluations give way to less-careful statistical comparisons of the empirical-nonsynthetic results . I believe works making specific performance claims based on empirical experiments without exception need to provide specific evidence in the form of statistical tests of significance , especially in cases like these when the performance gaps between the proposed method and baselines are so small . # # # Clarity 5/5 The text and diagrams themselves are clean , lucid , well-written , and well-presented . I do n't personally find the analysis in Sec.5 to be particularly helpful to understanding the method or the failure modes of fine-tuning and joint training , and would be happy to see it moved to the appendix in favor of more careful empirical evaluation , but perhaps some readers find it easier to understand concepts with theory . # # # Originality 4/5 This work has clear relationships to many prior works on parameter-space meta-learning and automatic hyperparameter tuning , and its own spin on the problem , which the authors acknowledge and provide context for . I have erred on the side of a higher rating in this category , thought do n't have encyclopedic experience with all of the background literature . While the proposal in the work is not eye-wateringly novel considering previous work on regularization and meta-learning , novelty in ML research is , in general , overrated , and I believe this work is sufficiently novel to be a contribution . # # # Significance 2/5 The analysis and synthetic experiments in this work are , I believe , a significant-enough contribution to the field irrespective of the proposed algorithm . If the paper itself contained only extended versions of the theoretical and synthetic-empirical experiment portions , I think it would be significant enough . Unfortunately , I have concerns about the significance of this work -- inclusive of the proposed algorithm , which readers will focus on -- for 2 reasons : ( 1 ) The proposed transfer solution negates many perceived and desired benefits of transfer and meta-learning , because it requires access to samples from the target distribution at train-time . Specifically , most researchers and practitioners pursue transfer learning specifically because they anticipate * not * having access to target samples at train time , e.g.in the case of adapting CV classifiers to unforseen target samples , or in the case of re-using a very large pre-trained CV or NLP model which -- might be impractical for the end-user to train -- for some unforseen application by an end user . The work does not address or acknowledge at all this slight compromise of the problem setting , or make efforts to justify its practicality in spite of this . ( 2 ) While the synthetic experiments show great performance benefits to the proposed method in a fabricated setting , the empirical-non-synthetic experiments show very little improvement over the baselines , especially L2-sp ( Li , et al.2018 ) , and it 's not clear from the provided analysis that the performance differences presented are even statistically-significantly different from L2-sp . This is especially notable given that fact that L2-sp * does not * require access to target samples at train-time ( i.e.it conforms to the more-general transfer learning setting ) , while MeRLin compromises the setting to achieve apparently-comparable but not substantially-improved results . # # # Misc Editorial Comments and Reviewer 's Notes # # # # Claims * The reader will learn about `` when and why fine-tuning and joint training can be suboptimal or even harmful for transfer learning '' * Proposed method MERLIN empirically outperforms SOTA transfer learning algorithms on vision and NLP benchmarks * Proves that MERLIN recovers the target ground truth model under some assumptions on NN architecture and source distributions , and that pre-training and join training fail # # # # Mechanisms * Ensuring that a head fit on top of the learned representations with ( target ) training data also performs well on ( target ) validation data # # # # 1 . Introduction * Does the assertion `` joint training easily overfits to the target especially when the target dataset is small '' hold if the target dataset is intentionally oversampled so that its examples appear as often as the source dataset ? If we do n't have the answer to this question , it could be that we are simply observing the effect of the data distribution being skewed . * `` any proposed algorithm [ ... ] should use the source and target simultaneously ... '' -- I think this statement is overly-strong considering the results in the paper . Certainly this is * one way * to ensure that we `` extract shared structures , '' but it also presupposes we have the target up front , which is opposed to many sought-after benefits of a transfer learning approach . Using the same evidence , we can argue instead that transfer learning methods should make use of as much data as possible , or search for data sources which are more diverse and general than both the source and the target . # # # # 5.Theoretical Analysis * I find this lucid but perhaps unnecessary for the reader 's understanding of the concept . It seems fairly intuitive that a learning algorithm with no access , or unbalanced access to to the target distribution will fail to learn features which generalize to that target distribution , and a learning algorithm which is intentionally supervised , using a loss computed on samples from the target distribution , will learn features which generalize to both the source and the target . * The important question then is `` do we give up more than we gain by requiring access to the target distribution ? `` * I recommend moving this portion to the Appendix to make more room for justifying the method and better in-text coverage of empirical results . # # # # 6.Experiments * Many of these results would seem to be quite close , especially when using only 3 trials and simple mean/stddev . How do the results compare with a real confidence interval ? e.g.a 95 % bootstrapped interval ( note the seaborn package will easily calculate these for you ) ? Are the differences observed statistically significant ?", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "4 ) \u201c Does the assertion `` joint training easily overfits the target especially when the target dataset is small '' hold if the target dataset is intentionally oversampled so that its examples appear as often as the source dataset ? \u201d In practice we use stronger data augmentation for the target domain and tune the hyper-parameter \\alpha ( the coefficient in front of the target loss ) to overcome the imbalance between the source and target domain . A larger \\alpha corresponds to reweighting up the target data . We also show in the theoretical analysis even with optimal \\alpha , joint training still overfits the target dataset . We suspect resampling the target will also not work because it has a somewhat similar effect to reweighting . This is also congruent with the findings in the literature on imbalanced dataset ( e.g. , [ 5 ] ) , which shows that re-sampling or reweighting rare data can potentially make the rare data train better , but do not solve the poor generalization performance of the rare data .

The authors generate a toy dataset , in which the source-specific and transferable features are thus clearly distinguishable , for the transfer learning tasks . As both fine-tuning and joint training are not optimal solutions for the experimental dataset , they further design MeRLin , which is based on the meta-learning mechanism , to learn a generalizable model weight . * Strengths * : 1 . In order to investigate how a model ( including a feature extractor and a classifier ) interacts with the source-specific feature and transferable feature within a data , the authors generate a toy dataset and examine the effectiveness of fine-tuning and joint-training methods . This provides clear and insightful experimental observations for the further understanding of transfer feature learning . 2.The observation that the fine-tuning and the joint training tends to learn the `` convenient '' feature ( i.e. , both methods tend to learn easy source-specific feature rather than a transferable feature ) provides a reasonable argument why both models can not work well . 3.The designed meta-learning-based method is convincing empirically , as the objective function implies the model has to learn a generalizable feature extractor for loss minimization . * Weakness/comments * 1 . Although the proposed demonstrates the above observations , the connection to existing domain adaptation/domain generation works seems lacking . Some of these works also aim to learn the feature , which can be generalized to the target domain . And the source-specific feature can be also regarded as the domain shift between source and target domains ( so that it can not be generalized by using fine-tuning ) . I understand the problem settings of domain adaptation/domain generation are a bit different from the setting used in the paper , while such discussion can further improve the completeness of this paper . 2.Another weakness is the baseline methods , as these baseline methods are too simple . I am wondering about the comparison to existing works on the relevant areas ( e.g. , other general feature learning or domain-relevant works ) . 3.One reason why people use pretraining method is neglected : one does not need to access the source dataset when the target task is trained . In some practical scenarios , one can not access the large scale of source dataset ( i.e. , imagenet ) , and this limits the use of the proposed model , which requires access to source data . But this point is just a comment , not a weakness as the authors have clarified the problem scope at the beginning of the paper .

The outer optimization minimizes the loss of inner-trained network when it is used to learn a new classification head for a validation set from the target domain . The authors first motivate their work by discussing the success and failures of joint training and fine-tuning , then they use principled experiments to verify hypotheses about the failure modes of these two popular transfer methods . Thereafter , they introduce their proposed method ( MeRLin ) , provide a theoretical analysis which compares its behavior to fine-tuning and joint training in a limited problem class , and then present empirical results showing the effectiveness of MeRLin on several popular CV and NLP benchmarks . # # Pros and Cons # # # Pros * Principled approach to analyzing the failure modes of fine-tuning and joint training # # # Cons * Requiring data from the target domain during training negates many of the sought-after benefits of transfer learning ( e.g.re-using pre-trained models quickly without lengthy pre-training , adapting to unforseen new tasks , etc . ) # # Evaluation # # # Quality 3/5 The overall quality of execution of this work is high , but not flawless . The work 's laudable careful theoretical and synthetic-empirical evaluations give way to less-careful statistical comparisons of the empirical-nonsynthetic results . I believe works making specific performance claims based on empirical experiments without exception need to provide specific evidence in the form of statistical tests of significance , especially in cases like these when the performance gaps between the proposed method and baselines are so small . # # # Clarity 5/5 The text and diagrams themselves are clean , lucid , well-written , and well-presented . I do n't personally find the analysis in Sec.5 to be particularly helpful to understanding the method or the failure modes of fine-tuning and joint training , and would be happy to see it moved to the appendix in favor of more careful empirical evaluation , but perhaps some readers find it easier to understand concepts with theory . # # # Originality 4/5 This work has clear relationships to many prior works on parameter-space meta-learning and automatic hyperparameter tuning , and its own spin on the problem , which the authors acknowledge and provide context for . I have erred on the side of a higher rating in this category , thought do n't have encyclopedic experience with all of the background literature . While the proposal in the work is not eye-wateringly novel considering previous work on regularization and meta-learning , novelty in ML research is , in general , overrated , and I believe this work is sufficiently novel to be a contribution . # # # Significance 2/5 The analysis and synthetic experiments in this work are , I believe , a significant-enough contribution to the field irrespective of the proposed algorithm . If the paper itself contained only extended versions of the theoretical and synthetic-empirical experiment portions , I think it would be significant enough . Unfortunately , I have concerns about the significance of this work -- inclusive of the proposed algorithm , which readers will focus on -- for 2 reasons : ( 1 ) The proposed transfer solution negates many perceived and desired benefits of transfer and meta-learning , because it requires access to samples from the target distribution at train-time . Specifically , most researchers and practitioners pursue transfer learning specifically because they anticipate * not * having access to target samples at train time , e.g.in the case of adapting CV classifiers to unforseen target samples , or in the case of re-using a very large pre-trained CV or NLP model which -- might be impractical for the end-user to train -- for some unforseen application by an end user . The work does not address or acknowledge at all this slight compromise of the problem setting , or make efforts to justify its practicality in spite of this . ( 2 ) While the synthetic experiments show great performance benefits to the proposed method in a fabricated setting , the empirical-non-synthetic experiments show very little improvement over the baselines , especially L2-sp ( Li , et al.2018 ) , and it 's not clear from the provided analysis that the performance differences presented are even statistically-significantly different from L2-sp . This is especially notable given that fact that L2-sp * does not * require access to target samples at train-time ( i.e.it conforms to the more-general transfer learning setting ) , while MeRLin compromises the setting to achieve apparently-comparable but not substantially-improved results . # # # Misc Editorial Comments and Reviewer 's Notes # # # # Claims * The reader will learn about `` when and why fine-tuning and joint training can be suboptimal or even harmful for transfer learning '' * Proposed method MERLIN empirically outperforms SOTA transfer learning algorithms on vision and NLP benchmarks * Proves that MERLIN recovers the target ground truth model under some assumptions on NN architecture and source distributions , and that pre-training and join training fail # # # # Mechanisms * Ensuring that a head fit on top of the learned representations with ( target ) training data also performs well on ( target ) validation data # # # # 1 . Introduction * Does the assertion `` joint training easily overfits to the target especially when the target dataset is small '' hold if the target dataset is intentionally oversampled so that its examples appear as often as the source dataset ? If we do n't have the answer to this question , it could be that we are simply observing the effect of the data distribution being skewed . * `` any proposed algorithm [ ... ] should use the source and target simultaneously ... '' -- I think this statement is overly-strong considering the results in the paper . Certainly this is * one way * to ensure that we `` extract shared structures , '' but it also presupposes we have the target up front , which is opposed to many sought-after benefits of a transfer learning approach . Using the same evidence , we can argue instead that transfer learning methods should make use of as much data as possible , or search for data sources which are more diverse and general than both the source and the target . # # # # 5.Theoretical Analysis * I find this lucid but perhaps unnecessary for the reader 's understanding of the concept . It seems fairly intuitive that a learning algorithm with no access , or unbalanced access to to the target distribution will fail to learn features which generalize to that target distribution , and a learning algorithm which is intentionally supervised , using a loss computed on samples from the target distribution , will learn features which generalize to both the source and the target . * The important question then is `` do we give up more than we gain by requiring access to the target distribution ? `` * I recommend moving this portion to the Appendix to make more room for justifying the method and better in-text coverage of empirical results . # # # # 6.Experiments * Many of these results would seem to be quite close , especially when using only 3 trials and simple mean/stddev . How do the results compare with a real confidence interval ? e.g.a 95 % bootstrapped interval ( note the seaborn package will easily calculate these for you ) ? Are the differences observed statistically significant ?", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "4 ) \u201c Does the assertion `` joint training easily overfits the target especially when the target dataset is small '' hold if the target dataset is intentionally oversampled so that its examples appear as often as the source dataset ? \u201d In practice we use stronger data augmentation for the target domain and tune the hyper-parameter \\alpha ( the coefficient in front of the target loss ) to overcome the imbalance between the source and target domain . A larger \\alpha corresponds to reweighting up the target data . We also show in the theoretical analysis even with optimal \\alpha , joint training still overfits the target dataset . We suspect resampling the target will also not work because it has a somewhat similar effect to reweighting . This is also congruent with the findings in the literature on imbalanced dataset ( e.g. , [ 5 ] ) , which shows that re-sampling or reweighting rare data can potentially make the rare data train better , but do not solve the poor generalization performance of the rare data .
