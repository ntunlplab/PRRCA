We thought of ways of integrating it with DARTS but quickly realized that speedup will not be significant . Our opinion is that DARTS is already quite fast ( but has no guarantees on finding the top models ) . Instead , we focused on sample-based NAS algorithms , which can indeed find the best model in a search space if given enough time . We hope to make sample-based NAS algorithms ( which are the slowest but most predictable ) faster . We will add text in the paper to explicitly address the compatibility of our approaches with DARTS . 4.We thank the reviewer for kindly pointing out typos and grammar errors \u2013 all are fixed in the updated manuscript .

The proposed method utilizes \u2018 pruning-at-initialization \u2019 works which computes gradient-computation at initialization as a proxy for performance of the given neural architectures . Through extensive experiments , this paper compares between conventional proxies and ablation study on five NAS benchmarks and shows the validation of the proposed proxy . # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Reasons for score Overall , I vote for weak rejecting . I like the idea of zero-cost proxies which decides the performance of neural architectures at initialization and the high utility of the zero-cost proxies available combining it with various NAS methods . However , my major concern is the limitation of zero-cost proxies where the correlations between the top 10 % performance neural architectures and the values estimated by zero-cost proxies look low to use as a proxy for searching for the best neural architectures . Hopefully , the authors can address my concern in the rebuttal period . # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Strong Points 1 . This paper provides zero-cost proxies that can estimate the performance of the given neural architectures at the initialization step saving time and resources . 2.The idea of this paper is simple yet effective , where this paper is inspired by pruning-at-initialization methods and adopt those methods as proxies for NAS methods . 3.This paper demonstrates the effectiveness through extensive experiments . It first performs evaluations among several zero-cost proxies candidates to select the best one , synflow and then combines synflow and conventional NAS methods to conduct experiments on various NAS-benchmark datasets . # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Weak Points 1 . My main concern is that zero-cost proxies may be not enough to use for searching the best neural architecture . The correlation between synflow which is the best one of zero-cost proxies and neural architectures for CIFAR10 from NAS201-Bench201 search space is 0.74 ( Table 1 ) . However , the correlation drops to 0.18 ( Table 7 of Appendix ) when we compute it between synflow , and neural architectures which have top 10 % ranking performance on CIFAR10 from NAS201-Bench201 search space ( Table 7 ) . In case NAS-Bench-ASR , it drops to 0.03 ( Table 7 ) which is nearly random . I believe while zero-cost proxies are suitable for estimate the performance tendency of all neural architectures from the search space , they are needed to be improved for the problems which search the best neural architectures . During the period , I hope the authors address my concern by performing additional experiments . 2.I think this paper has the property of the benchmark paper since this paper brings several zero-cost proxies applying it to existing NAS rather than designs a novel proxies . Thus , I expect that this paper shows more usecases combining zero-cost proxies with conventional NAS methods to demonstrate the usefulness of zero-cost proxies . 3.I recommend the results of cifar10 and imagenet120 of NAS-Bench 201 move to the original paper from the appendix . 4.Could the author shows the results of the Figure 4 as the form of the Table with exact values by selecting the results ? 5.Clarity of the paper looks needed . For example , ( 1 ) missing reference or model name ( 2 ) dataset description of NAS-Bench 201 of 4.1 ( 3 ) the detailed description of experimental setup of 4.1.2 . ( 4 ) the detailed description of warmup technique . What meaning of ( 1000 ) of warmup ( 1000 ) in Figure 4 .", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We thank R4 for their questions and comments , and we attempt to address the key weaknesses that were pointed out here . 1.We would like to point out that our results highlight the effectiveness of zero-cost warmup and zero-cost move proposal _in spite_ of the low correlation for top models . For example , even with the low correlation of 0.14 for NAS-Bench-101 top models our zero-cost algorithms achieve up to a 4X reduction in search time , and indeed , with the top models almost uncorrelated for NAS-Bench-ASR , there is still a significant and consistent speedup as demonstrated in the paper . We agree that top-10 % correlation alone does not explain the full story , so we ran more experiments to try and explain why our proxies work well given the poor rank correlation for the top-10 % of models . In Table 1 shows the percentage of top-10 % models predicted by a metric , that actually are in the top-10 % models with the highest accuracy . Our hypothesis is that it is most important that some top models are scored highly by our metric ( as shown for synflow in the table below ) . * * Table 1 . * * * Percentage of the top-10 % most-accurate models that are predicted correctly to be within the top-10 % . * | | grad_norm | snip | grasp | fisher | synflow | jacob_cov | | : - | : - : | -- : | -- : | -- : | -- : | -- : | | NB2-CIFAR-10 | 30 % | 31 % | 30 % | 5 % | * * 46 % * * | 25 % | | NB2-CIFAR-100 | 35 % | 36 % | 34 % | 4 % | * * 50 % * * | 24 % | | NB2-ImageNet16-120 | 31 % | 31 % | 32 % | 5 % | * * 44 % * * | 30 % | | NAS-Bench-101 | 2 % | 3 % | 26 % | 3 % | * * 23 % * * | 2 % | | NAS-Bench-ASR | 0 % | 0 % | -- | 0 % | * * 15 % * * | 44 % | * To clarify , consider the example of Aging Evolution ( AE ) search algorithm . This algorithm traverses the search space by exploring the neighbourhood of models within its pool , therefore , it is sufficient if zero-cost warmup selected some top models for the AE pool , and the AE algorithm will be able to quickly converge to a good result by mutating the top models within its pool . Table 2 below shows the number of top-5 % models that are ranked in the top-64 models returned by each metric . As the table shows , synflow is able to place many top-5 % models within the AE pool when used for warmup ; therefore , this makes AE+warmup converge much faster to a good result compared to the baseline . * * Table 2 * * . * Number of top-5 % most-accurate models within the top-64 models returned by each metric .

We hope this strengthens our argument and addresses R4 's main concerns . 2.We completely agree that a thorough and extensive empirical evaluation is needed for our work . We believe we achieved that by evaluating 4 NAS benchmarks and 4 competitive NAS algorithms including SOTA algorithms . Perhaps R4 can tell us which specific NAS algorithms are missing to demonstrate usefulness of our approach . 3.We opted to keep the results of CIFAR-10 and ImageNet120 in the appendix because they do not change any of the conclusions or trends observed with CIFAR-100 . We would prefer to leave these results in the appendix due to the limited space available in the main paper \u2013 we would rather use the extra page to address R4 \u2019 s main concern ( in point 1 ) . We will add text to explicitly point out that the results/trends presented in the appendix match the conclusions of the results presented in the main text on the NAS-Bench-201 benchmark . 4.Figure 4 contains a lot of information and tabulating everything may be infeasible ; therefore , to address R4 \u2019 s comment we will do two things ( 1 ) we will release all of our results alongside the codebase so others can inspect or reproduce our data where needed ( 2 ) we put a summary of Figure 4 in a table in the appendix \u2013 this may facilitate future comparisons to our work as well . 5.We are working hard to improve the clarity of our paper , and hope to address all R4 \u2019 s clarity-related comments in the upcoming revision ."}, {"review_id": "0cmMMy8J5q-3", "review_text": "Overall , this is a solid work with interesting ingredients .

Please see [ our response to R4 ( point 1 ) ] ( https : //openreview.net/forum ? id=0cmMMy8J5q & noteId=O56E1WMqM27 ) and the new Section 6 ( Discussion ) in the paper for a more detailed answer to this concern , including additional results that may help elucidate as to why zero-cost NAS is effective despite the low correlation for top models . We hope that this will sufficiently address R2 's second point . 3.We disagree with the third weakness raised by R2 . Many of the baseline NAS algorithms used in our paper are * capable * of finding the best models in our benchmarks if given enough time . Therefore , to compare NAS search methods , we look at accuracy achieved after a specific search time or the search time to achieve a specific accuracy . We were able to demonstrate that our zero-cost methods dominate all baseline NAS algorithms on either accuracy or search time ."}], "0": {"review_id": "0cmMMy8J5q-0", "review_text": "# Summary To reduce the cost of NAS , this paper focuses on zero-cost proxies to estimate the performance of network architectures without any training .

Indeed , the Perlmutter trick [ 1 ] is used to compute the Hessian-vector product and in practice it is computed through automatic differentiation in the Pytorch backward pass as done in [ 2 ] . We will add text and references to the revised manuscript to point this out . 2.We will add more text to clarify how we aggregate the metrics . We hope that , together with equations 1 and 2 , it becomes clearer for the reader . Specifically , our approach is to add the per-parameter or per-activation metrics to get a score for the whole network . 3.We agree that our zero-cost warmup/move algorithms are somewhat incompatible with differentiable architecture search such as DARTS . We thought of ways of integrating it with DARTS but quickly realized that speedup will not be significant . Our opinion is that DARTS is already quite fast ( but has no guarantees on finding the top models ) . Instead , we focused on sample-based NAS algorithms , which can indeed find the best model in a search space if given enough time . We hope to make sample-based NAS algorithms ( which are the slowest but most predictable ) faster . We will add text in the paper to explicitly address the compatibility of our approaches with DARTS . 4.We thank the reviewer for kindly pointing out typos and grammar errors \u2013 all are fixed in the updated manuscript . The title of this review and the score ' 6 ' suggests that perhaps there is more that needs to be addressed - if our responses above are not sufficient , please let us know what more we can do to make our work more complete/compelling .

The proposed method utilizes \u2018 pruning-at-initialization \u2019 works which computes gradient-computation at initialization as a proxy for performance of the given neural architectures . Through extensive experiments , this paper compares between conventional proxies and ablation study on five NAS benchmarks and shows the validation of the proposed proxy . # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Reasons for score Overall , I vote for weak rejecting . I like the idea of zero-cost proxies which decides the performance of neural architectures at initialization and the high utility of the zero-cost proxies available combining it with various NAS methods . However , my major concern is the limitation of zero-cost proxies where the correlations between the top 10 % performance neural architectures and the values estimated by zero-cost proxies look low to use as a proxy for searching for the best neural architectures . Hopefully , the authors can address my concern in the rebuttal period . # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Strong Points 1 . This paper provides zero-cost proxies that can estimate the performance of the given neural architectures at the initialization step saving time and resources . 2.The idea of this paper is simple yet effective , where this paper is inspired by pruning-at-initialization methods and adopt those methods as proxies for NAS methods . 3.This paper demonstrates the effectiveness through extensive experiments . It first performs evaluations among several zero-cost proxies candidates to select the best one , synflow and then combines synflow and conventional NAS methods to conduct experiments on various NAS-benchmark datasets . # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Weak Points 1 . My main concern is that zero-cost proxies may be not enough to use for searching the best neural architecture . The correlation between synflow which is the best one of zero-cost proxies and neural architectures for CIFAR10 from NAS201-Bench201 search space is 0.74 ( Table 1 ) . However , the correlation drops to 0.18 ( Table 7 of Appendix ) when we compute it between synflow , and neural architectures which have top 10 % ranking performance on CIFAR10 from NAS201-Bench201 search space ( Table 7 ) . In case NAS-Bench-ASR , it drops to 0.03 ( Table 7 ) which is nearly random . I believe while zero-cost proxies are suitable for estimate the performance tendency of all neural architectures from the search space , they are needed to be improved for the problems which search the best neural architectures . During the period , I hope the authors address my concern by performing additional experiments . 2.I think this paper has the property of the benchmark paper since this paper brings several zero-cost proxies applying it to existing NAS rather than designs a novel proxies . Thus , I expect that this paper shows more usecases combining zero-cost proxies with conventional NAS methods to demonstrate the usefulness of zero-cost proxies . 3.I recommend the results of cifar10 and imagenet120 of NAS-Bench 201 move to the original paper from the appendix . 4.Could the author shows the results of the Figure 4 as the form of the Table with exact values by selecting the results ? 5.Clarity of the paper looks needed . For example , ( 1 ) missing reference or model name ( 2 ) dataset description of NAS-Bench 201 of 4.1 ( 3 ) the detailed description of experimental setup of 4.1.2 . ( 4 ) the detailed description of warmup technique . What meaning of ( 1000 ) of warmup ( 1000 ) in Figure 4 .", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We thank R4 for their questions and comments , and we attempt to address the key weaknesses that were pointed out here . 1.We would like to point out that our results highlight the effectiveness of zero-cost warmup and zero-cost move proposal _in spite_ of the low correlation for top models . For example , even with the low correlation of 0.14 for NAS-Bench-101 top models our zero-cost algorithms achieve up to a 4X reduction in search time , and indeed , with the top models almost uncorrelated for NAS-Bench-ASR , there is still a significant and consistent speedup as demonstrated in the paper . We agree that top-10 % correlation alone does not explain the full story , so we ran more experiments to try and explain why our proxies work well given the poor rank correlation for the top-10 % of models . In Table 1 shows the percentage of top-10 % models predicted by a metric , that actually are in the top-10 % models with the highest accuracy . Our hypothesis is that it is most important that some top models are scored highly by our metric ( as shown for synflow in the table below ) . * * Table 1 . * * * Percentage of the top-10 % most-accurate models that are predicted correctly to be within the top-10 % . * | | grad_norm | snip | grasp | fisher | synflow | jacob_cov | | : - | : - : | -- : | -- : | -- : | -- : | -- : | | NB2-CIFAR-10 | 30 % | 31 % | 30 % | 5 % | * * 46 % * * | 25 % | | NB2-CIFAR-100 | 35 % | 36 % | 34 % | 4 % | * * 50 % * * | 24 % | | NB2-ImageNet16-120 | 31 % | 31 % | 32 % | 5 % | * * 44 % * * | 30 % | | NAS-Bench-101 | 2 % | 3 % | 26 % | 3 % | * * 23 % * * | 2 % | | NAS-Bench-ASR | 0 % | 0 % | -- | 0 % | * * 15 % * * | 44 % | * To clarify , consider the example of Aging Evolution ( AE ) search algorithm . This algorithm traverses the search space by exploring the neighbourhood of models within its pool , therefore , it is sufficient if zero-cost warmup selected some top models for the AE pool , and the AE algorithm will be able to quickly converge to a good result by mutating the top models within its pool . Table 2 below shows the number of top-5 % models that are ranked in the top-64 models returned by each metric . As the table shows , synflow is able to place many top-5 % models within the AE pool when used for warmup ; therefore , this makes AE+warmup converge much faster to a good result compared to the baseline . * * Table 2 * * . * Number of top-5 % most-accurate models within the top-64 models returned by each metric .

We hope this strengthens our argument and addresses R4 's main concerns . 2.We completely agree that a thorough and extensive empirical evaluation is needed for our work . We believe we achieved that by evaluating 4 NAS benchmarks and 4 competitive NAS algorithms including SOTA algorithms . Perhaps R4 can tell us which specific NAS algorithms are missing to demonstrate usefulness of our approach . 3.We opted to keep the results of CIFAR-10 and ImageNet120 in the appendix because they do not change any of the conclusions or trends observed with CIFAR-100 . We would prefer to leave these results in the appendix due to the limited space available in the main paper \u2013 we would rather use the extra page to address R4 \u2019 s main concern ( in point 1 ) . We will add text to explicitly point out that the results/trends presented in the appendix match the conclusions of the results presented in the main text on the NAS-Bench-201 benchmark . 4.Figure 4 contains a lot of information and tabulating everything may be infeasible ; therefore , to address R4 \u2019 s comment we will do two things ( 1 ) we will release all of our results alongside the codebase so others can inspect or reproduce our data where needed ( 2 ) we put a summary of Figure 4 in a table in the appendix \u2013 this may facilitate future comparisons to our work as well . 5.We are working hard to improve the clarity of our paper , and hope to address all R4 \u2019 s clarity-related comments in the upcoming revision ."}, "3": {"review_id": "0cmMMy8J5q-3", "review_text": "Overall , this is a solid work with interesting ingredients . The main contributions are mostly in terms of empirical results rather than a new search method . Strengths * The paper is very well-written and easy to follow . * The work presented simple yet effective ways to combine zero-shot proxies with existing NAS methods : ( 1 ) to initialize standard NAS algorithms , or ( 2 ) to guide the search process . Both approaches are interesting and have well demonstrated that zero-shot proxies are complementary to existing methods . * The paper has provided extensive evaluations over different metrics , search spaces and datasets . The results are presented in clear manner and are fairly convincing . Weaknesses * The technical novelty is limited in the sense that ( 1 ) the idea of zero-shot NAS is not new ( Mellor et al. , 2020 ) , and ( 2 ) the best zero-shot metric ( synflow ) is a straightforward application of the existing work . * Results for the rank correlation for top 10 % models ( A.3 ) are a bit disappointing because it seems to suggest zero-shot proxies are not able to identify high-performance architectures when used * alone * without leveraging other NAS methods , which are usually more expensive . * While the method provides speedup at the early-stage , it does not seems to offer gains on the high-performance region on top of strong methods ( e.g. , predictive methods in Table 3 ) .", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We thank R2 for their comments and feedback , and we provide a response to the weaknesses that were pointed out : 1 . Regarding technical novelty , we would like to point out that work by Mellor et al.is a concurrent submission to this conference ( ICLR2021 ) . Also , while we acknowledge that our zero-cost proxies are direct applications of existing zero-shot pruning work , ours is the first work to adapt these pruning metrics to the NAS domain , including enhancing existing NAS algorithms with zero-cost warmup and move proposal \u2013 given the strong and consistent results across benchmarks , we believe there is value to the NAS research community from our findings . 2.Indeed , correlation for top models is low , however , our results highlight the effectiveness of zero-cost warmup and zero-cost move proposal _in spite_ of the low correlation for top models . Please see [ our response to R4 ( point 1 ) ] ( https : //openreview.net/forum ? id=0cmMMy8J5q & noteId=O56E1WMqM27 ) and the new Section 6 ( Discussion ) in the paper for a more detailed answer to this concern , including additional results that may help elucidate as to why zero-cost NAS is effective despite the low correlation for top models . We hope that this will sufficiently address R2 's second point . 3.We disagree with the third weakness raised by R2 . Many of the baseline NAS algorithms used in our paper are * capable * of finding the best models in our benchmarks if given enough time . Therefore , to compare NAS search methods , we look at accuracy achieved after a specific search time or the search time to achieve a specific accuracy . We were able to demonstrate that our zero-cost methods dominate all baseline NAS algorithms on either accuracy or search time ."}}
