Quote - `` For each split of SBD-5i , we meta-train the PANet on training classes using the segmentation labels . In evaluation , we obtain the edge predictions of test classes by applying the Sobel edge detector on the segmentation masks as done in ( Acuna et al. , 2019 ) , and compare the predictions with the edge labels of test classes '' This evaluation mismatch is a serious flaw and I would love to either get an explanation for why this is actually correct or updated results on these . Generally , my view on this is that the evaluation should follow previous methods and should be done only on * exact * ground truth edges .

Evaluating with thicker edges as ground truth unfairly up-scores methods that generate thicker edges themselves , which are definitely not desirable . Therefore , I do n't think the dataset with thickened edges as proposed is viable to benchmark improvements in the future for few-shot edge detection . 2.Multi-Split Matching Regularization - The proposed MSMR technique is well ablated for the different choices of its hyperparameters , but at the end of the day is still an ad-hoc technique . What other design choices could be used ? The proposed splitting of the vectors into smaller vectors is basically a fixed set of projections from the original feature space to a lower dimension where the different projections discard a lot of dimensions . Is this the best choice ? There is a lot of theory behind random projections -- how would they work here ?

As reviewer mentioned , we first set sobel filter size to 1 and observed unsatisfactory result . We empirically found that optimal kernel size is 3 and conduct comparision accordingly . If given a chance , we will elaborate on detail in experimental setting . Moreover , as shown in Figure C.2 and Figure C.1 in appendix , PANet+Sobel indeed generates sufficiently thick edge prediction compared to that of CAFENet ( Ours ) Response to concerns about evaluation setting : We believe our answer can be summarized as follows : First , our thicked edge label is not too thick to be unfair . In SBD-5i , the edge we thicken is 3 to 4 pixels in images of 512x512 pixel size , which is not that big compared to the existing edge width ( 1 to 2 pixels ) in SBD dataset . In evaluation of most edge detection work , a value of tolerance is used to alleviate noise in edge label . In CASEnet [ 1 ] and SEAL [ 2 ] , a tolerance of 2 % is given to the SBD dataset , which means that an error of about 10 pixels is allowed in a 512x512 image . We believe that it is more accurate to measure the performance without tolerance on a relatively less noisy edge label than to give high tolerance on an inaccurate thin edge label . Also , inaccurate noisy labels have an adverse effect on training edge detector networks . STEAL used active alignment to create a more accurate edge label and trained an edge detector using that aligned label to overcome the infamous noise label of the SBD dataset . Therefore , we expect that the noise-reduced thickened edge label can also help train an accurate edge detector . Finally , we believe that our proposed dataset is viable enough to improve performance . CAFENet showed qualitative results for relatively easy categories such as cat and cow , but it was observed that even localization ( semantic segmentation ) was often performed improperly for difficult categories such as plant , tv , and table . Of course , it is important for the semantic edge detector to generate thin and crips boundaries , but the ability to grasp semantic information and localize objects seems to be dominate in few-shot segmentation . You can confirm this by significant perforance gap between FSE-1000 ( Table.2 ) and SBD-5i ( Table.1 ) . Edge widths of two datasets are similar , but the perfomance severely degrades in SBD-5i since it contains more cluttered and difficult images .

Response to question about comparison with previous approaches : The proposed CAFENet is actually an effective combination of semantic edge detection of Section 2.2 and few-shot segmentation of Section 2.3 ( or few-shot learning of Section 2.1 ) . Existing semantic edge detection networks are trained only using edge mask . However , in the few-shot learning scenario , it is difficult to obtain semantic information only with edge labels because the edge label itself represents only a very limited part of the target image . To solve this problem , we preprocess the edge label to create a segmentation label ( See section D , E in appendix for more information ) and perform perform few-shot segmentation to support the few-shot edge detection process to get high performance . To validate our approach , we train our network only using edge masks to produce attention map ( \u201c baseline \u201d in Section C of appendix ) , and it significantly drops the performance .

Cons : 1 This new task is very similar to the few-shot segmentation . What are the advantages of this task over few-shot segmentation ? The significance of this new research is doubtful . 2 The proposed method was named \u201c class-agnostic \u201d . However , it seems the basic setting is exactly the same as few-shot segmentation , i.e. , if I want to segment the horse in the given query , I need to provide a hose image and its mask . So , I think the method is class-aware rather than class-agnostic . 3 In my opinion , the main technical contribution of this work lies in the split-wise matching , which is employed to produce better segmentation masks . It is hard to find novel/specific designs in the edge detector part . So , I consider that the performance will significantly rely on the predicted segmentation masks , making this new task back to few-shot segmentation . 4 Using PANet + Sobel as a baseline is unfair . Authors should replace the few-shot segmentation branch with PANet and more latest advanced few-shot segmentation methods for comparison .", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "Response to Cons 1 : We stress few-shot edge detection is different from few-shot segmentation , althouth they bare some similarity . The few-shot edge detection model works much better than the few-shot segmentation model when finding the boundary of the object , and we show this with various experiments . In Section 5.4 and Appendix C , we confirm that the combination of few-shot segmentator ( PANet ) and Sobel edge detector generates inaccurate and blur edge prediction despite of its fine localization performance , while the proposed CAFENet generates more accurate and clear edge prediction results . Response to Cons 2 : We use the keyword of \u201c class-agnostic \u201d in the sense that our edge detector is not limited to a specific seen classes , but performs well for an arbitrary unseen class . A similar example of the keyword \u201c class-agnostic \u201d can be found in the title of [ 1 ] , which performs few-shot semantic segmentation .

In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition ( pp.5217-5226 ) . Response to Cons 3 : We note that applying the segmentation module is one of our main contributions . No one had tried to exploit segmentation modules to support a semantic edge detector . This work is first to propose how to extract segmentation labels from edge GT and employ them ( see Supplementary Material for more details on the segmentation label extractor ) . The performance leap from baseline to segmentation module is the largest , and we believe this is also our key contribution . In addition , the gains from attention and MSMR are meaningful , depending on the test set . For example , for 1 way 5-shot result of Table B.1 in Appendix , on the AP metric , \u201c Seg+Att+MSMR \u201d yields 63.92 versus 61.87 for \u201c Seg \u201d only , which is significant . Furthermore , one clearly sees qualitative improvements in the prediction of sematic edges in Fig.C.3 of the Appendix . Comparing the images of a person riding a horse between \u201c Seg \u201d and \u201c Seg+Att+MSMR \u201d , one clearly sees only the edge of the horse in \u201c Seg+Att+MSMR \u201d as desired , whereas both the human and the horse are still identified in \u201c Seg \u201d . Response to Cons 4 : We agree that comparing our CAFENet with the more advanced few-shot segmentation method would show the superiority of our method more clearly . We appreciate your valuable comment , and we conducted the experiments using more advanced few-shot segmentation method of Prototype Mixture Model , PMM [ 2 ] . We applied the Sobel edge detector to the output of PMM , and the experiment results show that the proposed CAFENet still works better than the combination of few-shot segmentator and edge detector , even when we utilize more advanced few-shot segmentator equipped with a bigger backbone ( ResNet-50 ) that ours ( ResNet-34 ) [ 2 ] Yang , B. , Liu , C. , Li , B. , Jiao , J. , & Ye , Q .

Instead of dealing with the problem in a single stage , the authors decompose the problem into two stages . First , a few-shot segmentation stage , where the foreground and the background probability are estimated via attention with the foreground and the background prototype ( averaged feature vector on the foreground and the background region ) . Second , the feature maps from the encoder are masked by the attention map and sent to the decoder to generate the final edge-map . In the experiments , the authors modify two existing datasets for evaluation . B.Strength : 1 . The method is clearly described and easy to reproduce . 2.Enforcing the group-wise similarity in sec.4.2 is a reasonable regularization . 3.The two-stage decomposition separates the high-level sub-task ( semantics ) from the low-level sub-task ( edge ) , which makes the training easier . C. Weakness : 1 . The attention map preserves the internal region of a class . However , this paper is about semantic edge detection , where the internal region does not contain any edge . So the author can try to process the final attention map by distance transform , which only focus on the region around the edge of the attention map and potentially further improve the results . 2.The comparison with previous methods , especially the PANet+Sobel is unfair . The semantic response map corresponds to the attention map in the proposed method , so the author should also use sobel operator on their attention map to have a fair comparison , which can also serve as an ablation study to verify whether the attention map is one of the major contributions to the edge quality . 3.Another ablation study worth to be investigated is to apply the attention map directly on the edge map , which will further sperate the high-level sub-task ( semantic attention maps ) from the low-level sub-task ( edge-detection ) . Some minor issues : 1 . The attention map in Fig.2 ( positive is black ) is inconsistent with the rest of the paper ( positive is white ) . D. Justification of the score : I vote for the current score because this paper lacks sufficient insights and novelty both algorithmically and conceptually . It also contains some issues in evaluation . E. Expectation for the rebuttal : I hope the authors could address my questions in C.weakness .", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "Response to weakness 1 : We appericiate the comment ; we have conducted experiments with the attention map that makes decoder to focus on the region around the edge of the semantic response map ( segmentation module output ) . Specifically , we generated the edge attention map by applying an average pooling on segmentation module output and subtracted the result from segmentation module output , following [ 1 ] . Experiment results show that applying edge attention map actually degrades the performance a bit ( less than 1 % for both AP and MF ) . We added the result of this ablation study in Appendix .

In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition ( pp.1623-1632 ) . Response to weakness 2 : We would like to note that the goal of the comparison with PANet + Sobel baseline is to show that it is impossible for a combination of few-shot segmentator and edge detector to replace few-shot edge detector . So as [ 2 ] did , we compared edge predictions obtained by applying Sobel operator to the output of PANET with the edge predictions from proposed CAFENet . [ 2 ] Acuna , D. , Kar , A. , & Fidler , S. ( 2019 ) . Devil is in the edges : Learning semantic boundaries from noisy annotations . In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition ( pp.11075-11083 ) . However , we agree that applying sobel operator on our attention map would be an interesting ablation study . As the reviewer suggested , we applied sobel operator to up-scaled segmentation output and compared it ( Seg+Sobel ) with PANET+Sobel . As a result , Seg+Sobel shows much inferior performance than PANet+Sobel . Specifically , Seg+Sobel has 2.09 % lower mean AP and 6.79 % mean MF in 5-shot setting . Also , Seg+Sobel has 3.41 % lower mean AP and 8.04 % Mean MF in 1-shot setting . The reason behind this result is as follows : The size of our segmentation module output is only 1/16 of the input image . It is impossible to directly compare the performance since the role of our segmentation module is localizing target objects and extracting semantic knowledge . Response to weakness 3 : We again agree that this is also an interesting ablation study . We conducted another experiment of applying the attention map directly to the edge map , without attentive decoding . We recorded the experimental result in Appendix B.2 . Applying attention map to the edge map generates better performance than non-attention method . Specifically , average precision ( AP ) increased by 3.66 % in 5-shot setting and 1.09 % in 1-shot setting . Maximum F-measure ( MF ) increased by 2.65 % in 5-shot setting and 1.20 % in 1-shot setting . This results show the effectiveness of semantic encoding . The experiments also show that our approach ( applying attention map before edge detector ) yields better results . Response to minor issues : We revised the Figure 2 and some other figures in our updated manuscript to make style of figures consistent ."}], "0": {"review_id": "LnVNgfvrQjC-0", "review_text": "This paper proposes the few-shot edge detection task , which is similar to few-shot segmentation but for the dual task of detecting semantic edges .

However , in the few-shot learning scenario , it is difficult to obtain semantic information only with edge labels because the edge label itself represents only a very limited part of the target image . To solve this problem , we preprocess the edge label to create a segmentation label ( See section D , E in appendix for more information ) and perform perform few-shot segmentation to support the few-shot edge detection process to get high performance . To validate our approach , we train our network only using edge masks to produce attention map ( \u201c baseline \u201d in Section C of appendix ) , and it significantly drops the performance . Response to minor comments : The digram on the left is not supposed to be split-wise matching . It should be pixel-wise matching , and we fix the diagram and uploaded the manuscripted with correct diagram . Thank you for your careful observation ."}, "2": {"review_id": "LnVNgfvrQjC-2", "review_text": "Pros : 1 This work is well written and easy to understand . 2 Extensive ablation experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed modules in the CAFENet . Cons : 1 This new task is very similar to the few-shot segmentation . What are the advantages of this task over few-shot segmentation ? The significance of this new research is doubtful . 2 The proposed method was named \u201c class-agnostic \u201d . However , it seems the basic setting is exactly the same as few-shot segmentation , i.e. , if I want to segment the horse in the given query , I need to provide a hose image and its mask . So , I think the method is class-aware rather than class-agnostic . 3 In my opinion , the main technical contribution of this work lies in the split-wise matching , which is employed to produce better segmentation masks . It is hard to find novel/specific designs in the edge detector part . So , I consider that the performance will significantly rely on the predicted segmentation masks , making this new task back to few-shot segmentation . 4 Using PANet + Sobel as a baseline is unfair . Authors should replace the few-shot segmentation branch with PANet and more latest advanced few-shot segmentation methods for comparison .", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "Response to Cons 1 : We stress few-shot edge detection is different from few-shot segmentation , althouth they bare some similarity . The few-shot edge detection model works much better than the few-shot segmentation model when finding the boundary of the object , and we show this with various experiments . In Section 5.4 and Appendix C , we confirm that the combination of few-shot segmentator ( PANet ) and Sobel edge detector generates inaccurate and blur edge prediction despite of its fine localization performance , while the proposed CAFENet generates more accurate and clear edge prediction results . Response to Cons 2 : We use the keyword of \u201c class-agnostic \u201d in the sense that our edge detector is not limited to a specific seen classes , but performs well for an arbitrary unseen class . A similar example of the keyword \u201c class-agnostic \u201d can be found in the title of [ 1 ] , which performs few-shot semantic segmentation .

In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition ( pp.5217-5226 ) . Response to Cons 3 : We note that applying the segmentation module is one of our main contributions . No one had tried to exploit segmentation modules to support a semantic edge detector . This work is first to propose how to extract segmentation labels from edge GT and employ them ( see Supplementary Material for more details on the segmentation label extractor ) . The performance leap from baseline to segmentation module is the largest , and we believe this is also our key contribution . In addition , the gains from attention and MSMR are meaningful , depending on the test set . For example , for 1 way 5-shot result of Table B.1 in Appendix , on the AP metric , \u201c Seg+Att+MSMR \u201d yields 63.92 versus 61.87 for \u201c Seg \u201d only , which is significant . Furthermore , one clearly sees qualitative improvements in the prediction of sematic edges in Fig.C.3 of the Appendix . Comparing the images of a person riding a horse between \u201c Seg \u201d and \u201c Seg+Att+MSMR \u201d , one clearly sees only the edge of the horse in \u201c Seg+Att+MSMR \u201d as desired , whereas both the human and the horse are still identified in \u201c Seg \u201d . Response to Cons 4 : We agree that comparing our CAFENet with the more advanced few-shot segmentation method would show the superiority of our method more clearly . We appreciate your valuable comment , and we conducted the experiments using more advanced few-shot segmentation method of Prototype Mixture Model , PMM [ 2 ] . We applied the Sobel edge detector to the output of PMM , and the experiment results show that the proposed CAFENet still works better than the combination of few-shot segmentator and edge detector , even when we utilize more advanced few-shot segmentator equipped with a bigger backbone ( ResNet-50 ) that ours ( ResNet-34 ) [ 2 ] Yang , B. , Liu , C. , Li , B. , Jiao , J. , & Ye , Q . ( 2020 ) .Prototype Mixture Models for Few-shot Semantic Segmentation . arXiv preprint arXiv:2008.03898 ."}, "3": {"review_id": "LnVNgfvrQjC-3", "review_text": "A.Summary : This paper works on few-shot semantic edge detection . Instead of dealing with the problem in a single stage , the authors decompose the problem into two stages . First , a few-shot segmentation stage , where the foreground and the background probability are estimated via attention with the foreground and the background prototype ( averaged feature vector on the foreground and the background region ) . Second , the feature maps from the encoder are masked by the attention map and sent to the decoder to generate the final edge-map . In the experiments , the authors modify two existing datasets for evaluation . B.Strength : 1 . The method is clearly described and easy to reproduce . 2.Enforcing the group-wise similarity in sec.4.2 is a reasonable regularization . 3.The two-stage decomposition separates the high-level sub-task ( semantics ) from the low-level sub-task ( edge ) , which makes the training easier . C. Weakness : 1 . The attention map preserves the internal region of a class . However , this paper is about semantic edge detection , where the internal region does not contain any edge . So the author can try to process the final attention map by distance transform , which only focus on the region around the edge of the attention map and potentially further improve the results . 2.The comparison with previous methods , especially the PANet+Sobel is unfair . The semantic response map corresponds to the attention map in the proposed method , so the author should also use sobel operator on their attention map to have a fair comparison , which can also serve as an ablation study to verify whether the attention map is one of the major contributions to the edge quality . 3.Another ablation study worth to be investigated is to apply the attention map directly on the edge map , which will further sperate the high-level sub-task ( semantic attention maps ) from the low-level sub-task ( edge-detection ) . Some minor issues : 1 . The attention map in Fig.2 ( positive is black ) is inconsistent with the rest of the paper ( positive is white ) . D. Justification of the score : I vote for the current score because this paper lacks sufficient insights and novelty both algorithmically and conceptually . It also contains some issues in evaluation . E. Expectation for the rebuttal : I hope the authors could address my questions in C.weakness .", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "Response to weakness 1 : We appericiate the comment ; we have conducted experiments with the attention map that makes decoder to focus on the region around the edge of the semantic response map ( segmentation module output ) . Specifically , we generated the edge attention map by applying an average pooling on segmentation module output and subtracted the result from segmentation module output , following [ 1 ] . Experiment results show that applying edge attention map actually degrades the performance a bit ( less than 1 % for both AP and MF ) . We added the result of this ablation study in Appendix .

In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition ( pp.1623-1632 ) . Response to weakness 2 : We would like to note that the goal of the comparison with PANet + Sobel baseline is to show that it is impossible for a combination of few-shot segmentator and edge detector to replace few-shot edge detector . So as [ 2 ] did , we compared edge predictions obtained by applying Sobel operator to the output of PANET with the edge predictions from proposed CAFENet . [ 2 ] Acuna , D. , Kar , A. , & Fidler , S. ( 2019 ) . Devil is in the edges : Learning semantic boundaries from noisy annotations . In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition ( pp.11075-11083 ) . However , we agree that applying sobel operator on our attention map would be an interesting ablation study . As the reviewer suggested , we applied sobel operator to up-scaled segmentation output and compared it ( Seg+Sobel ) with PANET+Sobel . As a result , Seg+Sobel shows much inferior performance than PANet+Sobel . Specifically , Seg+Sobel has 2.09 % lower mean AP and 6.79 % mean MF in 5-shot setting . Also , Seg+Sobel has 3.41 % lower mean AP and 8.04 % Mean MF in 1-shot setting . The reason behind this result is as follows : The size of our segmentation module output is only 1/16 of the input image . It is impossible to directly compare the performance since the role of our segmentation module is localizing target objects and extracting semantic knowledge . Response to weakness 3 : We again agree that this is also an interesting ablation study . We conducted another experiment of applying the attention map directly to the edge map , without attentive decoding . We recorded the experimental result in Appendix B.2 . Applying attention map to the edge map generates better performance than non-attention method . Specifically , average precision ( AP ) increased by 3.66 % in 5-shot setting and 1.09 % in 1-shot setting . Maximum F-measure ( MF ) increased by 2.65 % in 5-shot setting and 1.20 % in 1-shot setting . This results show the effectiveness of semantic encoding . The experiments also show that our approach ( applying attention map before edge detector ) yields better results . Response to minor issues : We revised the Figure 2 and some other figures in our updated manuscript to make style of figures consistent ."}}
