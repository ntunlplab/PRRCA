To track the history better, the authors propose to apply two pre-trained finite state transducers (FSTs) to take the sequence of dialog acts or strategies as inputs and output sequences of state embeddings for the hierarchical encoder-decoder (HED) part as inputs. The authors test their model on two tasks, a bargain task and a persuasion task. The model that the authors prepose makes sense to me. It seems that the FSTs can successfully help the model to track the history better and propose useful state embeddings for the rest part of the model, on both dialog acts and strategies. Also, the authors have done a comprehensive empirical study to show the gain of the proposed techniques over the pure HED model and some baseline method. So I think this is a good work. But potentially it would be better if the authors can show more insights and details for the FSTs. Some detailed comments: 1. The example dialogs in Table 3 show us that the FSTs can output dialog act distributions that can help the agent behave better compared to the case with an RNN for tracking the history, and the case without FST/RNN. This shows the success of the FST framework. 2. The authors have done a comprehensive comparison for the cases with / without the two FSTs, as well as the case without the strategy predictor. Also, the authors compared with another existing method (Sequicity). The proposed method performs well compared to the baseline methods, on both general performances and the two types of human-evaluations. This shows the good empirical performance of the proposed method. 3. This paper can be better if the authors can provide more insights and details for the FSTs. For example, why FST is better than RNN? The authors mentioned something about that, but it is not clear enough and it will be great if the authors can provide more discussions on this. In addition, the output alphabets and the sets of states are not clear for the FSTs, it will be better if the authors show the full details for the FSTs, as in my opinion this is the major contribution of this work. 4. A minor comment: There are some inaccurate expressions in this paper. For example, the authors mentioned that the FSTs about put probabilistic density functions. However, to my understanding, the set of dialog acts is finite, hence FSTs output probabilistic mass functions, not probabilistic density functions. Please proofread about that. Question: 1. Can you explain more about the choice for the parameters? For example, why the possible strategy output is a 15-dimensional binary-value vector? 2. For the loss L_{joint}, shouldn't it be (st_{t+1,j}\\not\\in u_{t+1}) in the indicator function?

Experiments on two datasets from prior work show the advantage of this model. Given the writing of this paper, I am not sure I understand the novelty of this work on the modeling side. Particularly, section 2.3 is too brief to provide enough technical details so readers can understand how exactly the two FST models work and why they are effective in encoding semantic and strategic information. With the important details being left out, it is difficult to evaluate the novelty of this work. In addition, although the evaluation in section 3 shows the proposed model outperforms some existing competitive systems. The experiment setup is questionable: - Both competitive systems (He et al., 2018) and (Lei et al., 2018) are not exactly the same as proposed in these two works.

They use belief span to track entities mentioned so far , while we are tracking dialog acts and negotiation strategies .

The table below shows the result . We observe an improvement of generation quality ( Bi.acc , Uni.acc , BLEU ) , but a worse performance for strategy prediction ( S.acc , S.F1 ) .

I read this paragraph multiple times , and I am still not sure whether I understand it correctly. \u201d * What is Uni.acc and why do we need it ? Previous work evaluates the generation quality only using BLEU . BLEU evaluates how close is the generated utterance to the ground truth . However , BLEU is unable to tell us whether the generated utterance uses the correct negotiation strategies , which is very important for non-collaborative dialog . Both BLEU and Uni.acc are used to evaluate the generation quality . However , instead of focusing on the surface form as BLEU does , Uni.acc quantifies the percentage of generated utterances that contain the correct negotiation strategies . * What is Bi.acc and why do we need it ? It is not enough to compare with the ground truth utterance in dialog generation . Because in dialogs , multiple responses can be correct given the context . So the ground truth utterance is only one of the many valid responses . To evaluate our model more accurately , we not only calculate a single Uni.acc using the ground truth , but also consider other possible correct strategies given the conversation context using Bi.acc . * Also we want to emphasize all the automatic evaluation metrics are insufficient to evaluate dialog qualities . They only capture partial information of dialog quality .
