Two criticisms that seems to shared across reviewers are that (i) it is debatable how \"novel\" the space of meta learning with \"few\" tasks is, especially since there aren't established standard for how many training tasks should be available, and (ii) the paper could use more comparisons with baseline methods and ablations to understand the contributions.  As an AC, I down-weight criticism (i) because I don't feel the paper has to be creating a new problem definition; it's acceptable to make advances within an existing space.  However, criticism (ii) seems to remain.  After conferring with reviewers it seems that the rebuttal was not strong enough to significantly alter the reviewer's opinions on this issue, and so the paper does not have enough support to justify acceptance.  The paper certainly addresses interesting issues, and I look forward to seeing a revised/improved version at another venue.

Please find our response below . C1 : `` I would modify it so instead of discarding miniImageNet classes that are overlapping with Places I would discard the problematic Places classes . This way it will be easier to compare to standard FSL . '' A1 : In Appendix B , we show results on the full miniImageNet dataset . Compared to the modified version , all results are increased nearly uniformly regardless of the initialization being random or pretrained . Therefore , conclusions made with the modified miniImageNet hold when there is some overlap between the pre-training dataset and the few-shot dataset . Removing the overlapping classes from Places before pre-training is something that we explicitly exclude in the definition of the problem : `` we do not have access to its training process or data '' , as stated at several places . This choice stems from a very practical consideration : it allows for large networks pre-trained on large-scale data , which can be used off-the-shelf without repeating the process in every paper . This makes it harder to control overlap , which is however compensated by limiting the amount of base class data . C2 : `` Also , I do n't understand why for CUB the benchmarks includes k= { 0,1,5 } while for miniImageNet it is k= { 0,20,50 } , obviously k= { 0,1,5 } are more interesting . '' A2 : Contrary to CUB where k=1 is already bringing noteworthy improvements over k=0 , base training with k < 20 images on miniImageNet per class does not bring significant improvement . One interpretation is that CUB , being a fine-grained dataset , has low variety of visual content such that few examples are enough to adapt the pre-trained model to the new domain . Another interpretation is that due to the larger domain gap between Places and CUB , few examples can bring significant improvement . We shall discuss . We can of course add a few more measurements as well . C3 : `` As for the suggested method , I find it hard to judge since there are no strong baselines to compare against .

When k is larger , the gain from spatial attention is lower but is still consistent . When k=ALL , spatial attention does not bring any accuracy improvement but does not degrades it significantly either ( greatest loss is by 0.3 % ) , making it a safe choice especially for small k. Improvements of adaptation are consistent everywhere . The gain is impressive ( up to 8 % ) on CUB with few base classes ( k=0 or k=1 ) .

The two \u201cfew-shot\u201d in the name refers to base training tasks and novel test tasks. In their algorithm, they use a model pre-trained on another dataset as the prior knowledge and fine-tune it on training tasks. During the test, they use the weighted average of samples\u2019 representations per class as the prototype of each class, where the weight is large for samples with more discriminative prediction over pre-trained domain\u2019s classes. Afterward, classification is reduced to finding the nearest neighbor among the class prototypes. Some experiments show that the pre-trained model can improve few-shot classification accuracy. My major concerns: 1) They try to propose a new problem, but their description shows that the problem is exactly the same as what most \u201cfew-shot learning\u201d works aim to solve: use a pre-trained model, train a meta-learner on few-shot training tasks, and apply it to novel test tasks. 2) The algorithm does not have any important contributions comparing to existing ones: they define a prototype per class based on the pre-trained model and apply the nearest neighbor classification. The so-called \u201cprototypical classifier\u201d is actually the nearest neighbor classifier since no prototypical network structure is learned in the proposed method. 3) I would not call the weighted average as \u201cattention\u201d because it is not: the weight in attention is computed by a module with learnable parameters, while the weight in this paper is computed by the entropy of a pre-defined model\u2019s output prediction. 4) The \u201cspatial attention\u201d only makes sense when the pre-trained domain\u2019s classes can describe the main concepts appearing in the images of novel classes. This assumption is too strong since it requires class-level (rather than lower-level) relationships. 5) The base training is not necessary in the algorithm: it is used to only fine-tuning theta and W. As the author said in the beginning of Section 4.1, they can directly solve novel tasks based on the pre-trained model. 6) The experiments show that the pre-trained model is helpful in few-shot learning, which is a known fact. 7) The writing of this paper is very poor: a lot of typos and grammar errors, inconsistency between narratives, abuse of notations, wrong equation reference, even missing punctuations.

'' Reviewer # 2 appears to agree on the validity of this argument . C5 : `` The base training is not necessary in the algorithm : it is used to only fine-tuning theta and W. As the author said in the beginning of Section 4.1 , they can directly solve novel tasks based on the pre-trained model . '' A5 : Certainly we can solve new tasks , but is that good enough ? On CUB for instance ( Table 1 ) , k=5 can be up to 18 % better than k=0 ; k=ALL can be more than 40 % better . C6 : `` The experiments show that the pre-trained model is helpful in few-shot learning , which is a known fact . '' A6 : Pre-training on a large-scale dataset from another domain has not been studied in the context of few-shot learning . This comment is apparently due to the poor understanding of the problem , as addressed in A1 . C7 : `` The writing of this paper is very poor : a lot of typos and grammar errors , inconsistency between narratives , abuse of notations , wrong equation reference , even missing punctuations . They make the paper hard to understand . '' A7 : We are always open to constructive criticism . A comment as severe as this would deserve at least some concrete examples for each kind of writing error ."}}
