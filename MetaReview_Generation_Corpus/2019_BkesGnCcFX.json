The new proposal is evaluated on two goal-conditioned tasks from low-dimensional observations, and show modest improvements over HER and a function-approximation version of Floyd-Warshall RL, mostly as measured against the number of times the reward function needs to be recomputed. Pros: - minor improvement in computational cost - investigation of classical FWRL technique in context of deep RL Cons: - computational improvement seems very minor - sparse-reward implementations of HER already do essentially what this paper proposes Comments: The main contribution of the paper appears to be the addition of what the authors refer to as a \"step loss\", which in this case enforces the Q function to correctly incorporate the termination condition when goals are achieved. I.E. the discounted sum of future rewards for states that achieve termination should be exactly equal to the reward at that timestep. It's not clear to me how this is fundamentally different than HER. One possible \"sparse reward\" implementation of HER involves no reward function recomputation at all, instead simply replacing the scalar reward and termination flag for resampled transitions with the indicator function for whether the transition achieves the resampled goal. Is this not essentially identical to the proposal in this paper? I would consider this a task-dependent implementation detail for an application of HER rather than a research contribution that deserves an entire paper. The authors claim the main advantage here is avoiding recomputation of the reward function for resampled goals. I do not find this particularly compelling, given that all of the evaluations are done in low-dimensional state space: reward recomputation here is just a low-dimensional euclidean distance computation followed by a simple threshold. In a world where we're doing millions of forward and backward passes of large matrix multiplications, is this a savings that really requires investigation? It is somewhat telling that the results are compared primarily in terms of \"# of reward function evaluations\" rather than wall time. If the savings were significant, I expect a wall time comparison would be more compelling. Maybe the authors can come up with a situation in which reward recomputation is truly expensive and worth avoiding? All of the experiments in this paper use a somewhat unusual task setup where every timestep has a reward of -1. Have the authors considered other reward structures, such as the indicator function R=(1 if s==g else 0) or a distance-based dense reward? Would this proposal work in these cases? If not, how significant is a small change to HER if it can only work for one specific reward function? Conclusion: In my view, the main contribution is incremental at best, and potentially identical to many existing implementations of HER. The reconsideration of Floyd-Warshall RL in the context of deep neural networks is a refreshing idea and seems worth investigating, but I would need to see much more careful analysis before I could recommend this for publication.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "> The main contribution of the paper appears to be ... equal to the reward at that timestep .

No , this is not identical to the paper . At no point in our algorithm do we check the condition s == g. The proposed one-step loss that learns one-step reward Q ( s_t , a_t , g=s_ { t+1 } ) = r_t as we apply one-step loss to every transition . One-step loss is therefore task independent .

In machine learning , the sample complexity is always distinguished from computation complexity . The only case where the two are comparable is when the samples are generated from simulations which is , admittedly , true for our experiments . However , our proposed improvement is general enough to be applicable to non-simulation experiments . It is a consequence of this task-dependent reward formulation that it can be re-sampled cheaply , hence , the computational cost is improvement is marginal . But we eliminate a redundancy common to the HER algorithm and its derivatives . With the massive popularity of HER ( 107 citations and counting ) , we believe that this is a worthwhile contribution to bring to the attention of the RL community . Consider the example of an agent navigating a maze where the goal is specified in the form of an image . The semantic comparison of the observed image with the goal image is an expensive operation that will require separate training for goal-dependent reward formulation [ 1 ] . However , in our proposed formulation , the comparison operation ( s == g ) in the reward formulation is not needed thereby eliminating the need of another learning module . > All of the experiments in this paper use a somewhat unusual task setup where every timestep has a reward of -1 . This unusual reward formulation is possible because of our contribution ( one-step loss ) . Hence , it is only true for the experiments that are referred to with `` Ours '' label . All the baselines ( HER and FWRL ) and `` Ours ( goal rewards ) '' operate on the reward structure for HER which is R= ( 0 if s==g else -1 ) . > Have the authors considered other reward structures , such as the indicator function R= ( 1 if s==g else 0 ) or a distance-based dense reward ? > Would this proposal work in these cases ? If not , how significant is a small change to HER if it can only work for one specific reward function ? We have considered and we are advocating against such reward structures because of their goal dependence . In fact in one experiment we run our algorithm with the reward structure R= ( 0 if s==g else -1 ) which is equivalent to yours with a constant shift . These results can be found in Fig.4 ( b ) , labeled as `` Ours ( goal rewards ) '' . Distance-based dense reward is by definition goal dependent . Our contribution is to eliminate this dependence . RL on dense rewards is easier than sparse rewards . Hence , we do not believe that distance-based reward adds much to our contribution . We do note that our method does work with goal based sparse rewards ( Fig.4b ) and hence we would expect to continue to work with dense rewards . > The reconsideration of Floyd-Warshall RL ... recommend this for publication . We analyze FWRL and added the ablation study of loss function in Appendix Figure 6 . It is clear that FWRL inspired loss function do not contribute to better learning . Instead , they hurt the performance . We think this is because Bellman inspired loss already captures the information that FWRL inspired constraints intend to capture .

In HER , the agent receives -1 reward for all state transitions except on reaching the goal when it receives 0 reward . In contrast , for our reward formulation the agent receives -1 reward for all state transitions including when agent reaches and continues to stay at the goal . Second , our reward formulation is atypical with respect to conventional Reinforcement Learning ( RL ) . In conventional RL , a high reward is used to specify the desired goal ( goal-reward ) . However , this goal-reward is not necessary in goal-conditioned RL because the goal specification is already given at the start of every episode . We believe that this result is counter-intuitive and will be interesting to the RL community . We clarify the reviewer 's concerns and edit our draft to minimize chances of similar confusion . Clarity : 1 . The main difference between HER , FWRL and our algorithm lies in the choice of loss terms used . HER uses Eq ( 3 ) , FWRL uses Eq ( 3 ) + L_up + L_lo , and Our algorithm uses Eq ( 3 ) + L_step as shown in the pseudo-code . Another difference is due to reward formulation . Because our rewards are independent of reaching the goal , we do not need to recompute rewards . We have added the description about these differences in the appendix to highlight them . 2.We have introduced the requested citations at appropriate places in the paper . Since [ 1 ] introduced the idea of FWRL before Dhiman et . al.2018 , we replace the attributions accordingly in the paper .

Similar to HER , our goal states are not absorbing/terminal . Instead the episodes are of fixed number of steps and the agent is encouraged to stay in the goal state for as long as possible . This is how the replay buffer is populated and how the average episode reward is computed . However , the objective maximized is equivalent to treating this fixed length episode problem as if the episodes are terminating on reaching the goal . To further clarify this in the paper , we have added reward structure details to the Introduction ( section 1 , paragraph 3 ) and the Experiments section ( section 5 , end of paragraph 1 ) . 3.One-step loss is different from both the terminal step of both Q-Learning and [ 1 ] . One-step loss is different from terminal step of Q-Learning because it is applied to every state transition rather than just the terminal step of the episode .

Correspondingly we have updated the manuscript in both the introduction and the one-step loss section to include one-step-episode Q-Learning perspective . One-step loss is also different from the terminal step of [ 1 ] . Referring to Section 3 of [ 1 ] , we see the one-step loss ( Eq.8 ) as an alternative of the terminal condition DG * ( s , a , g ) = 0 if s = g in the recursive definition of DG * ( s , a , g ) . As an alternative , one-step loss translates to DG * ( s_t , a_t , g_ { t+1 } ) = -1 , for all transitions ( s_t , a_t - > g_ { t+1 } ) i.e.it removes the dependence of checking s=g . Although it serves the same purpose of terminal condition in recursive definition but the condition is mathematically different and requires the different assumption that one-step path is the highest reward path between s_t and g_ { t+1 } . 4.As stated earlier , our reward independent of desired goal . The reward re-computation for the pseudo-goals becomes unnecessary because the reward does depend upon the check if current state is same as the desired goal .

( B ) Significance ( a ) The counter-intuitive result that goal-conditioned RL does not need goal reward is worth bringing to the attention of the RL community ( b ) The absence of the requirement of reward-recomputation is significant because in real robotics experiments , the reward computation may not be possible without re-running the entire experiment .

The idea builds on an extension of a prior work on FWRL. The paper presents empirical comparison of the proposed method with two baselines, FWRL and HER. The experimental results are mixed, and do not convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness/superiority of the proposed method. The idea of the proposed method is relatively simple, and is not theoretically justified. Based on these observations, the paper falls short of the conference standard. ", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "reply_text": "Thank you for your feedback . 1.The experimental results are mixed , and do not convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness/superiority of the proposed method . The results are mixed when the learning curves are compared with respect to the epochs ( the number of transition samples ) that intentionally does not take reward-recomputation in to account . When this computation is taken in to account , our algorithm comprehensively improves upon the baselines in 6 out of 8 experiments . To further highlight these differences we magnify our reward-recomputation plots to eliminate sections where curves overlap and are non-informative . These changes can be found in Figure 2 and 3 . We further reiterate that reward recomputation cost can be significant dependent upon the environment and setup . In cases when the reward-computation depends upon collisions and haptic feedback of real robots , the reward recomputation may even be impossible without re-running the experiment . Hence reducing reward-computation based on a simple loss term is an important contribution . 2.The idea of the proposed method is relatively simple , and is not theoretically justified . The main contribution of this paper is to show that goal-conditioned value functions can be learned without requiring goal-reward . We believe that the simplicity of this proposed idea is the beauty of the method leading to significant changes in performance of the algorithm when reward recomputation is taken in to account . Our algorithm builds upon HER which does not itself possess theoretical guarantees . We would be able to addess this point specifically if the reviewer could clarify what kind of theoretical justification they would expect to see ."}}
