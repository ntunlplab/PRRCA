The proposed MV-TER loss essentially measures the estimation accuracy of the 3D transformation , thus minimizing the MV-TER loss leads to the learning of transformation equivariant representations .

Also , feature maps from the same category are similar to each other , while those from different categories are discriminative , which shows the robustness of the learned descriptor . We hope with our clarifications , the reviewer will see our fundamental contributions ."}, "2": {"review_id": "0fqoSxXBwI6-2", "review_text": "Summary : This paper proposes a self-supervised learning framework for 3D object classification and retrieval based on multi-view representation , where a sub-task of transformation estimation is adopted as a regularizer . By adding the proposed MV-TER loss , the STOA approaches can gain notable improvement in performance . Strengths : -The paper is well written , and the idea of transformation equivariant representation of 3D objects is easy to understand . -The proposed method further improved the stoa methods on 3D object classification , which is already quite high . Areas for improvement : -Firstly , the representation of the transformation that the author used in the paper is not well specified . I assumed that the Euler angle representation is used in this paper , but I think it is not proper to use the MSE loss in ( 5 ) or take the average in ( 8 ) for Euler angles . -Secondly , since it has been suggested by many previous work that the joint-training of multi-task is helpful for the network , it will be appreciated that the authors provide more analysis and discussion on how the MV-TER loss helps the network learn transformation equivariant representation than simply using rotation as data-augmentation or using pose-estimation as sub-task . -Thirdly , any quantitative results of the transformation estimation ? From the images in Appendix B , the results of ( average ) are incredibly accurate .", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We thank the reviewer for the valuable comments . * * Q : The representation of the transformation that the author used in the paper is not well specified . I think it is not proper to use the MSE loss in ( 5 ) or take the average in ( 8 ) for Euler angles . * * * * A : * * The 3D rotation transformation is parametrized by three Euler angles ranging from $ [ -\\pi , \\pi ] $ , which represent the rotation angles of the x- , y- , z-axis of the 3D object , respectively . Since we sample discrete rotation transformations , it is reasonable to use the MSE loss for the estimation of 3D transformations and take the average in Eq . ( 8 ) .We will make this clear in the paper . * * Q : It will be appreciated that the authors provide more analysis and discussion on how the MV-TER loss helps the network learn transformation equivariant representations . * * * * A : * * Optimizing the MV-TER loss ensures the definition of the transformation equivariance as in Eq . ( 4 ) , i.e. , $ E ( \\widetilde { \\mathbf V } _i ) = \\rho ( \\mathbf t ) E ( \\mathbf V_i ) $ , where $ E $ is the representation encoder , $ \\mathbf V_i $ and $ \\widetilde { \\mathbf V } _i $ are views before and after projected 3D transformations , and $ \\rho ( \\mathbf t ) $ is a homomorphism of the 3D transformation $ \\mathbf t $ . Specifically , we ensure the definition by decoding the 3D transformation parameter $ \\mathbf t $ from the fused feature representations of multiple views before and after transformation , i.e. , $ E ( \\mathbf V_i ) $ and $ E ( \\widetilde { \\mathbf V } _i ) $ . The proposed MV-TER loss essentially measures the estimation accuracy of the 3D transformation , thus minimizing the MV-TER loss leads to the learning of transformation equivariant representations . In contrast , the definition of transformation equivariant representations is not guaranteed to be satisfied by simply adopting rotation as data-augmentation or using pose-estimation as a sub-task . * * Q : Any quantitative results of the transformation estimation ? * * * * A : * * We present some quantitative results of the transformation estimation ( i.e. , the MV-TER loss ) in the table below . The MV-TER loss reaches 0.59 at the 50th epoch , which is quite small . We also demonstrate detailed quantitative results of transformation estimation from the average scheme in Figure 6 of Appendix C in the rebuttal revision . | Epoch | 10 | 20 | 30 | 40 | 50 | | : - : | : - : | : - : | : - : | : - : | : - : | | MV-TER Loss | 3.28 | 2.99 | 2.03 | 0.98 | 0.59 |"}, "3": {"review_id": "0fqoSxXBwI6-3", "review_text": "The authors propose a self-supervised learning technique for multi-view learning based on a simple intuition that the transforms of the 2D views of a 3D object will be in an equivariant manner as the 3D object transforms .

They have successfully backed up their claims by applying the idea in two different frameworks and show clear improvements .

While our work and the related works provide a bridge between 3D and 2D in general , we particularly exploit transformation EQUIVARIANT representations instead of invariant representations , where the representations of multiple views equivary to projected 3D transformations . The 3D transformation applied to the 3D object links feature representations of multiple views projected from the object . By decoding the applied 3D transformation from the feature representations of multiple 2D views , the model learns 3D information that reveals the intrinsic structure of the 3D object . We will make a full discussion to the related works and our work ."}}
