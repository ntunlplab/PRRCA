In the framework, there is no primitive agent construct, but rather a set of basic recurrent network components (such as linear algebra operations). The framework is open-ended and objective-less.

At the same time, together with a majority of reviewers (mostly experts in relevant topics such as neuro-evolutionary methods and artificial life), I felt that this work is not ready to be presented at a major conference, for three main reasons. 1) It should make its links to the huge literature on artificial life outside the ICLR community clearer. 2) The empirical work is somewhat limited and 3) this is not counterbalanced by a clear theoretical roadmap.\n\nI thus do not recommend acceptance, although I really hope the authors will present a more thoroughly worked out version of the paper soon.\n", "reviews": [{"review_id": "160xFQdp7HR-0", "review_text": "This is an interesting paper that proposes a particular Alife framework to study the question of how to create an AI-generated algorithm .

Strengths : + This paper 's topic is a nice opportunity to enable the AI/ML community to know better about Alife approaches to artificial intelligence + The particular topic of open-endedness is also highly relevant , including in the perspective taken in this paper where one aims to model complex dynamical systems that do not assume a pre-defined concept of agent/individuals . This is useful in helping researchers in the AI community to deconstruct some of the assumptions of the models they are working on Weaknesses : - The paper does not explain clearly the relevance of the Alife approach to AI , in particular it does not explain well the historical roots of this idea that could enlighten AI readers ( e.g.discussing foundational work such as Brooks and Steels , 1995 ) , and does not analyze what fundamental contributions where made in the past , and what were the limits . - Related to the point above , the paper does not position itself clearly in this vast literature : both the general/theoretical ideas and the experimental framework discussed overlap significantly with the large body of work in Alife . Clear statements of contributions would be useful . - It is not clear what is the concept of `` ( general ) intelligence '' considered here , and whether there is a real value/utility in using this word , as opposed to saying the family of systems discussed in the paper is for studying the `` self-organization and evolution of complex structures '' . Formulating the general problematics around theoretical questions on the origins and evolution of complexity would also enable better linking with the literature in the sciences of complexity and theoretical biology , which is not sufficiently made in the current version of the paper . - It is not clear what is the logical rationale of the listing of principles considered in the paper : what is the scientific objective of this list of principles ? how can one measure/evaluate their utility ? where do they come from ? Also , there seems to be some ( at least apparent ) inhomogeneity between them , e.g.point 1 says `` there should be no built in notion of an individual '' , but point 2 says `` the evolution of new emergent individuals create novel opportunities ...

Thus , it is not clear which properties are more general/differ/more useful than these other works - There is no proposed methodology for evaluating the success/failure/progress of the approach : e.g.how could one characterize the self-organized structures that are qualitatively observed in the preliminary runs presented in the paper ? What are precisely the scientific questions addressed by experiments , and how can experiments answer them ? I recommend the author ( s ) frame more precisely their work in terms of scientific objectives and links with the conceptual history of alife approaches to AI .

We agree on a lot of your points , and both discuss them below , and updated the paper : We positioned the paper better in literature ( agent hypothesis section , and a reference in principles section , and we might still make some additions ) and provided more complete description of the system ( appendix ) .

It also provides a novel neural cellular automata system . Points 1 , 2 : We significantly expanded that section ( now the limit is 9 pages starting with rebuttal phase ) positioning the paper in the literature . Point 3 : While studying \u201c self-organization and evolution of complex structures \u201d is actually really interesting , the primary purpose of this paper is to propose a framework for achieving general intelligence . While opinions and definitions on what this is vary , there is a general sense of what it means , such as \u201c Ability to solve a large number of diverse problems in complex environments \u201d or \u201c being at least as good as humans in everything \u201d . Point 4 : Principles are useful summaries of the most important aspects of a problem . They guide design of algorithms and systems . For the other point : Points 2,3 mention individuals where we specifically put in the bracket \u201c ( here emergent ) \u201d meaning emergent individuals . We can emphasize that point more . Point 5 ( formal definition ) . We modified the appendix to explain the system in detail . Point 6.The main purpose of the specific implementation in the paper is both for being able to better explain the proposed ( abstract ) system ( for example explaining what would writing into another element look like ) and to create elements of minimal implementation containing the core principles . However , as stated , we lack certain things to make this better , such as better neural operations , as well as more advances in enabling larger structures to form . Yet , it does form a novel neural cellular automata system . Point 7.We have indeed been trying to figure out how to make clear conclusions from these experiments , or from objective-free system in general . While we do show that it does evolves ( e.g.system evolves to collects energy even if it doesn \u2019 t \u201c have to \u201d ) , more work on this needs to be done here . Again as mentioned - the issue is that the specific system is not as good as it should be - it both needs better neural algorithms and better way to form larger structures . We hope to continue building better such systems in the future both in terms of the \u201c physics \u201d rules and in terms of neural algorithms . However , this will take some time , and we felt that the overall framework and the demonstration has reached a sufficient level that it would be useful for other researchers to think about this and come up with different ideas and implementations , rather than waiting another year to make it work . Conferences are good venues for sharing such ideas ."}, {"review_id": "160xFQdp7HR-3", "review_text": "The paper describes a framework for artificial life , where basic building blocks are artificial neural networks ( ANN ) elements ( matrix multiplication , and other linear algebra operations ) , intended to be open-ended and without any guiding objective . The authors emphasis that in their proposed approach there is no predefined distinction between environment and agents , as they attempt that the 'physics ' of their proposed framework allow agents to emerge on their own . Pros : - The paper is very well written . Language is clear at times , the paper is well organized and the there is no overuse of math notation . - The framework advanced by the authors seems solid enough to experiment on the emergence of life . - Results need to be further analyzed , but they are encouraging at this stage of the research . - Paper provides in-depth , or even philosophical , discussion relating topics such as emergence of life and current advances in computer science . It is very re-freshing to read a paper that is not only about surpassing other methods by a marginal score in benchmark datasets . Cons : - Although the paper provides a thorough discussion on related work , it is surprising that it does not make more emphasis on results related to cellular automata . Conway 's Game of life seems to comply with their main aim at developing an environment where no distinction between agents and environment is made , and where agents emerge on their own . It would be good if authors provide a bit of contrast discussion on this issue . - There are some strong claims across the paper or concepts being left without neither references or definitions . For example : 1 . In Sec.2.1 authors introduce the concept of `` general intelligence '' . What exactly does that mean ? 2.Also , in Sec.2.1 authors claim that human brain computation closely resembles recurrent networks , but they do not provide a reference that backs such strong statement . Last time I check , there was little evidence that processes similar to backpropagation were happening in the brain , let a alone that artificial neurons models are now considered poor approximations of actual neurons . 3.The whole idea that life is objective-less can be controversial . A recent hypothesis [ 1 ] actually suggests that the life 's objective is to accelerate entropy , that is , that emergence of life-like molecular structures , and even evolution itself , are only a consequence , or even a particular case , of second law of thermodynamics . Authors should be more careful when dealing with such motifs . References : 1 . England , J. L. ( 2013 ) . Statistical physics of self-replication .

Point 7.We have indeed been trying to figure out how to make clear conclusions from these experiments , or from objective-free system in general . While we do show that it does evolves ( e.g.system evolves to collects energy even if it doesn \u2019 t \u201c have to \u201d ) , more work on this needs to be done here . Again as mentioned - the issue is that the specific system is not as good as it should be - it both needs better neural algorithms and better way to form larger structures . We hope to continue building better such systems in the future both in terms of the \u201c physics \u201d rules and in terms of neural algorithms . However , this will take some time , and we felt that the overall framework and the demonstration has reached a sufficient level that it would be useful for other researchers to think about this and come up with different ideas and implementations , rather than waiting another year to make it work . Conferences are good venues for sharing such ideas ."}, "3": {"review_id": "160xFQdp7HR-3", "review_text": "The paper describes a framework for artificial life , where basic building blocks are artificial neural networks ( ANN ) elements ( matrix multiplication , and other linear algebra operations ) , intended to be open-ended and without any guiding objective . The authors emphasis that in their proposed approach there is no predefined distinction between environment and agents , as they attempt that the 'physics ' of their proposed framework allow agents to emerge on their own . Pros : - The paper is very well written . Language is clear at times , the paper is well organized and the there is no overuse of math notation . - The framework advanced by the authors seems solid enough to experiment on the emergence of life . - Results need to be further analyzed , but they are encouraging at this stage of the research . - Paper provides in-depth , or even philosophical , discussion relating topics such as emergence of life and current advances in computer science . It is very re-freshing to read a paper that is not only about surpassing other methods by a marginal score in benchmark datasets . Cons : - Although the paper provides a thorough discussion on related work , it is surprising that it does not make more emphasis on results related to cellular automata . Conway 's Game of life seems to comply with their main aim at developing an environment where no distinction between agents and environment is made , and where agents emerge on their own . It would be good if authors provide a bit of contrast discussion on this issue . - There are some strong claims across the paper or concepts being left without neither references or definitions . For example : 1 . In Sec.2.1 authors introduce the concept of `` general intelligence '' . What exactly does that mean ? 2.Also , in Sec.2.1 authors claim that human brain computation closely resembles recurrent networks , but they do not provide a reference that backs such strong statement . Last time I check , there was little evidence that processes similar to backpropagation were happening in the brain , let a alone that artificial neurons models are now considered poor approximations of actual neurons . 3.The whole idea that life is objective-less can be controversial . A recent hypothesis [ 1 ] actually suggests that the life 's objective is to accelerate entropy , that is , that emergence of life-like molecular structures , and even evolution itself , are only a consequence , or even a particular case , of second law of thermodynamics . Authors should be more careful when dealing with such motifs . References : 1 . England , J. L. ( 2013 ) . Statistical physics of self-replication .

We modified the paper and address your comments here . * Cellular automata and game of life : We had a very brief discussion on cellular automata and particle systems ( well , one sentence ) which we significantly expanded in the current version of the paper ( uploaded ) - in the agent hypothesis section . Game of life is probably the original such system and we added the reference . * General intelligence : We just mean it in a loose sense , such as \u201c Ability to solve a large number of diverse problems in complex environments \u201d or \u201c being at least as good as humans in everything \u201d ( including creating new things ) . * Brain as an RNN : We do n't mean a classic RNN trained by back-propagation in time ( the brain is not trained this way ) - but in a looser sense : That the core computational/informational units are neurons with the states of their bodies ( corresponding the activations ) and the state of their synapses ( corresponding to weights ) as the main processing units , and that update in an online fashion as characterized in that paragraph . In this sense this is not controversial and we will clarify it in the text . * The idea that life is objective-less is controversial but the following is our opinion : For example if the purpose of life was to say accelerate entropy - how would it actually happen ? There isn \u2019 t someone that rewards a given entity each time it increases an entropy so we think that such principle might be a consequence of evolution ( and a useful characterization ) rather than a purpose ."}}
