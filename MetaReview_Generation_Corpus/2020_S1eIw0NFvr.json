To this end, the paper performs statistical tests to identify such classes (and samples) from a population of neural network models of different levels of pruning. In particular, the identified samples, called PIEs, are shown to have significantly lower test accuracy, i.e., the PIEs are much harder to classify, and a user study is performed to support this claim. The paper also demonstrates that pruned models tend to have lower accuracy against adversarial attacks or common corruptions.

One of my primary concerns, however, is that I am still not convinced whether the empirical findings presented here is indeed significant, as some reader might feel those results are not that surprising. I personally feel that it is much more likely that pruning gives heterogeneous effects over the classes, since current pruning schemes do not enforce the \"uniform\" brain damage, i.e., they simply aim to minimize total accuracy drops.
