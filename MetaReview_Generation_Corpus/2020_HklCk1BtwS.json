The authors provide a theoretical explanation for how the hyperparameter alpha controls the distance between words in the embedding and a method to estimate the optimal alpha.  The authors also provide experiments showing the alpha found using their method is close to the alpha that gives the highest performance on the word-similarity task on several datasets. \n\nThe paper received 2 weak rejects and 1 weak accept.  The reviews were unchanged after the rebuttal, with even the review for weak accept (R2) indicating that they felt the submission to be of low quality.  Initially, reviewers commented that while the work seemed solid and provided insights into the problem of learning word embeddings, the paper needed to improve their positioning with respect to prior work on word embeddings and add missing citations.  In the revision, the authors improved the related work, but removed the conclusion.\n\nThe current version of the paper is still low quality and has the following issues\n1. The paper exposition still needs improvement and it would benefit from another review pass\nFollowing R3's suggestions, the authors have made various improvements to the paper, including modifying the terminology and contextualizing the work.  However, as R3 suggests, the paper still needs more rewriting to clearly articulate the contribution and how it relates to prior work throughout the paper.  In addition, the conclusion was removed and the paper still needs an editing pass as there are still many language/grammar issues.\n\nPage 5: \"inherites\" -> \"inherits\"\nPage 5: \"top knn\" -> \"top k\"\n\n2. More experimental evaluation is needed.\nFor instance, R1 suggested that the authors perform additional experiments on other tasks (e.g. NER, POS Tagging).  The authors indicated that this was not a focus of their work as other works have already looked at the impact of alpha on other task.  While prior works has looked at the correlation of alpha vs performance on the task, they have not looked at whether alpha estimated the method proposed by the author will give good performance on these tasks as well.  Including such analysis will make this a stronger paper.\n\nOverall, there are some promising elements in the paper but the quality of the paper needs to be improved.  The authors are encouraged to improve the paper by adding more experimental evaluation on other tasks, improving the writing, as well as incorporating other reviewer comments and resubmit to an appropriate venue. \n", "reviews": [{"review_id": "HklCk1BtwS-0", "review_text": "In this paper, the authors study the word embedding, with a particular emphasize on the word2vec or similar strategies.

More concretely, word embeddings work by either implicitly or explicitly factorizing a co-occurrence matrix, and the underlying parameter alpha controls how the singular values are weighted between the word and the context vectors. The authors provide theoretical insights on the role of alpha in relation with the original co-occurrence matrix, and propose a new method to find its optimal value. I think that this is overall a solid work. The paper provides a new perspective in the workings of word embeddings that I find interesting, it is theoretically well-founded (although I did not check all derivations in detail), and the presentation is clear. However, I think that the paper does a poor job in putting its contributions into context in relation to previous work. In particular, the role of alpha in word embeddings was already studied empirically by Artetxe et al. (CoNLL'18, https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/K18-1028.pdf) for both word analogy and word similarity tasks, to the extent that Figure 2 in both papers is showing the exact same curves. However, the authors do not even cite it. As acknowledged in the paper, other authors like Levy et al. (TACL'15) also observed that the value of alpha was important in their experiments. I think that the right narrative for the paper should more in the line of \"previous work showed that alpha behaves this and that way; we provide a theoretical explanation for this behavior, and derive a method to automatically find its optimal value\". However, starting from the title (\"word embedding re-examined: is the symmetrical factorization optimal?\", when it was already known that it wasn't) and the abstract (where only the statement that \"we propose a method to find the optimal alpha\" corresponds to a novel contribution), the paper does a poor job in identifying and properly contextualizing its real contributions. More importantly, the paper does not try to establish any connection between the authors own theory and the empirical findings from previous work. In terms of the actual content, the authors constantly claim that word2vec is performing a symmetric factorization (e.g. \"the original word2vec is implicitly performing a symmetric factorization, thus implying the alpha equal to 0.5) as if it was something obvious or well-known. I might be missing something here, but I do not see why this is the case. Following your notation, let's say that word2vec is implicitly factorizing M = E*C^T, where E are the word embeddings and C are the context embeddings. One could multiply E with any arbitrary invertible matrix W, and C by the transpose of its inverse W^-T, which could be chosen to completely break any symmetry, yet the objective value of word2vec would not change at all, as (E*W)*(C*W^-T)^T = E*C^T. In other words, there is nothing in the training objective of word2vec that forces a symmetric factorization, and there is always an optimal solution with respect to this training objective that is arbitrarily asymmetric. Another point that raises concerns to me is that the optimal value of alpha is determined by the vocabulary of the evaluation task. It would make sense if the optimal alpha depended on the nature of the task (e.g. syntactic vs semantic), but I do not have any intuition (nor do the authors provide) as of why the vocabulary would be anyhow relevant. More importantly, this does not seem generalizable beyond a few intrinsic tasks as, in the general case, one wants good embeddings for the full vocabulary. In either case, I think that this point deserves more attention in the paper. I also find the experimental evaluation to be somewhat weak. In particular, the proposed theory focuses in two phenomena (word similarity and word analogy) as stated in the abstract itself, but the empirical evaluation is limited to the word similarity task. Also, this is a minor detail and it did not influence my score, but I dislike that the authors use \"word2vec\" to refer to skip-gram with negative sampling throughout the paper.

Our claim that SGNS is performing a symmetric factorization is based on the existing works .

So , if the goal is to make the word embedding perform well for a specific dataset , we can particularly consider the relative distance of words ( word similarity task ) and the relative distance of pairs ( e.g . ( `` France '' , `` Germany '' ) and ( `` Paris '' , `` Berlin '' ) ) . Or if the goal is to learn a general word embedding that is not designed for a specific task , we can consider all words instead of some particular words .
