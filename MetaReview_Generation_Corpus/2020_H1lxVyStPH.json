Visual recognition of various domains evaluates recognition performance in terms of generalization due to multiple test domains . We will add the experiments with the CIFAR and SVHN data sets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the GCFN . Due to the short rebuttal period , the experiment results will be added in the final version of this paper . The proposed method is not only suitable for domain generalization and visual recognition of the paper , but can be extended to the general recognition tasks on the CIFAR and SVHN datasets . 2.It is correct that the proposed method iteratively learns a generalized feature distribution based on the split results of a random forest . Thus , the learned feature distribution is not independent of each decision tree . However , when creating a new decision tree in a random forest , it does not take into account the splitting results of previously trained decision trees . In other words , the feature learning algorithm includes a process that depends on the partition results of the decision tree , but there is no dependency process for the train decision tree itself . Thus , we use a metric of the upper bound of generalization error for theoretical implications . As suggested by the reviewer , it is worth studying more because learning methods break the independence of input functions . However , we show that the upper bound of generalization error and actual experimental results are almost the same , and the results are meaningful for showing the generalization ability of the proposed method . 3.We apologize for the confusion of the representations in Figure 3 and Table 1 .

A detailed description of this topic follows . It is known that large bias and variance cause overfitting problems . The model generalization reduces the overfitting problem by regularizing the learning model . A well-trained random forest is known to have low bias and variance to generalize the classification task . To have low bias of a random forest , a good practice is to learn the decision tree very deeply . For low bias in each tree , the bagging strategy of a random forest reduces the variance for the final prediction . Therefore , in general , random forests can have low bias and variance . However , there is still bias and variance dilemma in training decision trees . Making each decision trees very deep increases the variance of the decision tree . Suppose that if tree depth is one , there are only two decisions that the tree can make , which leads to lower variance . However , if the tree depth is ten , the number of decision cases will be about one thousand , resulting in a much higher variance . Therefore , if each decision tree has too high variance due to the depth , a random forest can still have a large variance even after the bagging process . To mitigate this problem , we introduce the GCFN , which constructs very low bias where the variance is not too high . We use the strength and correlation terms to theoretical analyze the overfitting problem due to the bias and variance dilemma . The positive sampling strategy of our method contributes to increasing the strength , and thus each tree has a low bias value . On the other hand , the negative sampling scheme regularizes the rapid increase of the strength , which can cause the overfitting problem while reducing the correlation . We measure the degree of model overfitting in terms of the upper bound of generalization error in the paper . We show that the proposed sampling strategy reduces the upper bound of the generalization error , and therefore , the GCFN can provide the generalized performance of various visual recognition tasks and avoid the overfitting problem even with very low bias .
