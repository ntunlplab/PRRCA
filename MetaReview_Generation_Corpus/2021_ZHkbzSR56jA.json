Perhaps a general criticism is valid as to what is the operational value of the proposed guarantees.

Specifically , the server temporarily stores gradients on multiple ( namely $ B $ ) buffers and performs a proper robust aggregation to compute a more robust from them . When $ B = 1 $ , BASGD is reduced to ASGD . They also conduct experiments to show the performance of BASGD . The paper is well written and easy to follow . All proof seems correct though I didn \u2019 t check very carefully . However , there are some issues : 1 . Compared to other asynchronous SGD methods , one advantage of BASGD is it doesn \u2019 t have the need of storing any samples on the server . However , I didn \u2019 t understand why such property is meaningful . The authors declare that it helps BASGD take less risk of privacy leakage . Noting the server store gradients on buffers and gradients may leak privacy [ 1 ] . If a third party can have access to the buffers , privacy leak can still happen . BASGD didn \u2019 t use techniques like differential privacy , so it seems ill-founded to say \u201c BASGD takes less risk of privacy leakage \u201d . 2.In my opinion , Theorem 1 doesn \u2019 t guarantee that BASGD is able to find a stationary point of $ F $ since the extra constant variance will not vanish when $ T $ goes infinity . By contrast , ZENO++ , a robust fully asynchronous SGD , could ensure convergence to a stationary point . This strikes me that the theorem is quite weak . Theorem 2 has the same problem . 3.It makes me feel strange to assume the gradient is biased ( Assumption 2 ) . For example , If we want to minimize $ F ( w ) $ but we use stochastic gradients computed from another $ \\tilde { F } ( w ) $ ( that is totally different from $ F ( w ) $ ) , could we still guarantee the algorithm converges to the stationary point of $ F ( w ) $ ? I am afraid the answer is NO . This thought experiment not only shows using biased gradients doesn \u2019 t help convergence but also shows Theorem 1 doesn \u2019 t guarantee the convergence of BASGD . 4.Some parts of the algorithm are not well explored . For example , how the performance of BASGD changes when we vary the value of $ q $ or the value of $ B $ . The experiment didn \u2019 t explore these aspects . Besides , Noting that the number of buffers $ B $ is quite important for good performance , however , there is no investigation on how $ B $ affects convergence and no suggestion on how to choose a proper $ B $ . In experiments , $ B $ is set in advance for no reason . [ 1 ] Ligeng Zhu , Zhijian Liu , and Song Han . Deep leakage from gradients .

However , I didn \u2019 t understand why such property is meaningful . * * + In traditional machine learning , it is OK to store samples on the server . However , storing samples on the server may be no longer possible in federated learning ( FL ) . In the setting of FL , data should be keeping decentralized to mitigate many of the systemic privacy risks [ 1 ] . Therefore , it is difficult for the service provider ( server ) to store a large number of high-quality instances . + The reviewer said that storing gradients may also leak privacy . However , we would like to point out that it is still an open problem whether transmitting gradients will cause privacy leakage . There are also many recent works presenting or improving differential privacy [ 2 ] , which is a technique for privacy defense . Besides , homomorphic encryption is also a powerful privacy-defense technique [ 3 ] . + In conclusion , storing samples is not possible in the setting of federated learning , where workers are no longer under the control of service provider . In this case , Byzantine attacker is more likely to appear . Thus , we believe the property that BASGD does n't need storing any samples on the server is meaningful . * * Theorem 1 doesn \u2019 t guarantee that BASGD is able to find a stationary point of $ F $ , while Zeno++ could ensure convergence to a stationary point . * * + We have to point out that the convergence of Zeno++ [ 4 ] is under an assumption called Polyak-\u0141ojasiewicz ( PL ) inequality , which says $ \\exists \\mu > 0 , $ such that $ \\forall x , \\ f ( x ) -f ( x_ * ) \\leq\\frac { 1 } { 2\\mu } ||\\nabla f ( x ) ||^2 $ . This is a very strong assumption , under which there is only one stationary point ( global minimum $ x_ * $ ) . In addition , the norm of gradient $ ||\\nabla f ( x ) ||^2 $ is bounded below by $ 2\\mu [ f ( x ) -f ( x_ * ) ] $ . Many machine learning models do not satisfy this property . Besides , Zeno can be seen as the synchronous version of Zeno++ . The convergence proof of Zeno is under the general non-convex assumption , and there is also an extra constant term [ 5 ] . Many Byzantine learning methods use robust aggregation to obtain the gradient for updating . However , there is a gap between the aggregated result and the true global gradient $ \\nabla F ( w_t ) $ , because of the Byzantine attack . A biased gradient is used for parameter updating . Under this circumstance , it is hardly possible for the method to be guaranteed to converge to a stationary point . * * It makes me feel strange to assume the gradient is biased ( Assumption 2 ) . Using biased gradients doesn \u2019 t help convergence . * * + The biased gradient assumption is from the problem setting of federated learning , where the instances stored on different workers are non-IID . Each worker can only obtain a biased estimation of global gradient $ \\nabla F ( w_t ) $ based on its stored instances and the parameter $ w_t $ . As the review said , it is more difficult to guarantee the convergence when the gradient is biased , let alone there are Byzantine workers . Thus , we believe the theoretical result is acceptable that $ \\frac { 1 } { T } \\sum_ { t=0 } ^ { T-1 } \\mathbb { E } [ ||\\nabla F ( w_t ) || ] ^2 $ is bounded by a relative small positive value . * * The influence of buffer number $ B $ is not well explored . Besides , there is no investigation on how $ B $ affects convergence and no suggestion on how to choose a proper $ B $ . * * + The effect of $ B $ is empirically explored in the image classification experiments . The experimental results are presented in Figure 2 ( a ) and Figure 2 ( d ) . Many thanks for your constructive suggestion . We add the discussion of the effect of $ B $ and give suggestions for the choice of $ B $ at the end of Section 3 in the rebuttal revised version .

Its main contributions include generalization of the existing literature on Byzantine fault tolerance in distributed learning to incorporate the case of asynchronous learning . This generalization involves an algorithm , convergence analysis for the algorithm , and experimental results .

What is the meaning of $ t $ in this usage of the worker index ? 2.The writing of the paper could use some proofreading . Some of the sentences are hard to parse on first read , while some other sentences suffer from grammatical errors . As a specific example , I could not understand the meaning of `` Only when all buffers have got changed since the last SGD step , ... '' in Section 3.1 until I reread the main parts of the paper . 3.Related to the previous point , the discussion in Section 3.1 in general is hard to parse because of the notation and could benefit from revision . Also , $ m $ in this section is undefined up to this point in time and it is not clear what it means . 4.A number of aggregation functions have been proposed in prior works ( see e.g.Adversary-resilient distributed and decentralized statistical inference and machine learning : An overview of recent advances under the Byzantine threat model ) .

However this speed-up does not seem to be coming up in the analysis or the discussion . In the absence of such a speed-up , it is not clear if the authors are really providing guarantees that are useful for distributed learning . 6.It would be useful to discuss the impact of heavily delayed workers on the algorithm .

However , the thorough proof is lengthy . For space-saving , we provide an intuitive idea here . The sum of $ l_2 $ -norm form $ \\sum||y-y_i|| $ reveals that the objective function is $ 1 $ -Lipschitz w.r.t.each $ y_i $ and convex w.r.t. $ y $ .Thus , minima $ y^ * $ is $ 1 $ -Lipschitz w.r.t.each $ y_i $ , revealing that GeoMed satisfies Definition 4 . Also , the aggregated result of GeoMed can be bounded by the combination of loyal gradients , since loyal gradients make up the majority . the two inequalities in Definition 5 can be proved by using this property . + * * Bulyan * * uses an existing aggregation rule to obtain a new one .

This is the main contribution of our work . + In this problem setting , instances are locally stored on each worker , and gradients can only be locally computed by each worker . Thus , computation is distributed to each worker naturally by the problem setting . In cases without Byzantine workers , the computation of each worker is $ O ( 1/m ) $ .

We address the concerns point by point as follows : * * BASGD is not fully asynchronous as the paper claims to be . The whole system will be slowed down by the slowest buffer . * * + We are sincerely appreciated to reviewer R3 for pointing out our improper statements . We have modified the statement in the latest rebuttal revised version . + Besides , we would like to point out that the asynchrony is greatly damaged only when the buffer number $ B $ is close to $ m $ . It is true that the whole system will be slowed down by the slowest buffer . However , the probability of its occurrence is very small when $ B $ is not that large . More specifically , there are about $ ( m/B ) $ workers corresponds to each buffer . A buffer will become a straggler only when the $ ( m/B ) $ workers are all stragglers . The probability is relatively low when $ ( m/B ) $ is not too small . + In real-world federated learning settings , there may be hundreds of millions of mobile devices used as workers [ 1 ] , and the Byzantine worker number $ r $ will be much smaller than $ m $ . In this case , $ B $ is suggested to be set large enough to have resilience against $ \\hat { r } $ ( a relatively large estimation of $ r $ in advance , according to practical application ) Byzantine workers . Therefore , $ ( m/B ) $ is not a small number . The probability is very low that $ ( m/B ) $ workers are all stragglers . + In addition , even if the server 's model weight parameter is not updated when receiving worker $ _k $ 's gradient , the parameter sent back to worker $ _k $ may also be newer than worker $ _k $ 's .

When worker $ _k $ sends gradient to the server , server may not execute an SGD step , but the parameter sent back ( i.e. , $ w_2 $ ) is newer than worker $ _k $ 's ( i.e. , $ w_1 $ ) . * * This paper does not explicitly state how to choose the number of buffers $ B $ in order to achieve both asynchrony and Byzantine-robustness . * * + We thank reviewer R3 for the suggestion .

The convergence proof for median only will be much easier . + Since BASGD can be seen as a technique of asynchronization , we want to prove the convergence of BASGD not only for a distinct aggregation , but also a class of aggregation functions .

They provide theoretical guarantees and some experiments on small-scale tasks . # # # # Originality Synchronous methods for byzantine learning enable one to compare communicated gradients with one another in order to filter out byzantine workers . When updates are asynchronous , such a procedure can not be employed because gradients are not necessarily communicated to the master node at the same time . Previous work on Asynchronous byzantine learning stores training instances on the master node to alleviate this issue . This work proposes instead to use gradient buffers on the server to eliminate the need to store training instances on the master node ; this is the main selling point of the algorithm , and deems the method sufficiently novel in my opinion . However , the motivation for avoiding storing instances on the master node is not well fleshed out in my opinion . Though the applications to Federated Learning are mentioned , updates are typically performed locally on-device and * parameters * are communicated back to the master , and therefore this method is not applicable to that setting . It is unclear exactly what the privacy concerns are , but I would suggest reworking the motivation exposition a little . # # # # Significance and Quality The method is actually quite nice and intuitive . The significance relates back to improving the motivation , but the method may be of sufficient interest to the community . * On the theory * : Note that the bounded gradient assumption is very strong ! when combined with the L-smoothness assumption , it implies a convergent subsequence a priori ! In short , it is like assuming ahead of time that the algorithm convergence . $ N^t_b $ is used in the main paper ( e.g. , page 5 ) , but is only defined in the appendix on page 14 . I would suggest including a one sentence description that these are the number of gradients stored in buffer $ b $ at iteration $ t $ . Under asynchrony or non-iid data , theorem 1 does not guarantee convergence to a stationary point\u2026 even with a diminishing step-size . Moreover , even with iid data and fully synchronicity and a diminishing step-size , the algorithm still does not converge to a stationary point due to the extra variance term on the r.h.s . I do not mean to criticize the results ; only to point out this fact . Moreover , these bounds are somewhat vacuous due to the presence of the non-degrading $ D $ gradient boundedness term on the r.h.s of Theorem 1 in the variance term . With L-smoothness and the assumption of $ D $ -bounded gradients , as I mentioned above , all iterates of any objective ( regardless of the algorithm ) , will remain with a ball of a stationary point , the size of which is proportional to $ D $ . ( To the authors credit , I have seen similar bounds in previous byzantine learning methods ) . For Theorem 2 , as I understand it , the $ \\alpha^ { 1/2 } $ term actually has a $ \\mathcal { O } ( 1/\\sqrt { T } ) $ dependence , so unless i \u2019 m missing something , why not remove the constant $ \\alpha $ and substitute in a quantity that decays with $ 1/\\sqrt { T } $ , and state the theorem results for all $ T \\geq $ some threshold ( to satisfy the current $ \\alpha < 1 $ constraint ) . this reformulation will make it clearer that the only lingering ( non-decaying factor ) is $ A_1 $ , which is due to gradient bias . More generally , I am curious if there is a way to correct for the convergence errors and improve the results to guarantee convergence to a stationary point ( and not some neighborhood thereof ) , given that a $ \\frac { 1 } { \\sqrt { T } } $ step-size is employed . # # # # Clarity Work is sufficiently clear .

In local updating methods , workers can also send the differences between the updated parameter and the original one . The difference may have more small elements ( close to $ 0 $ ) , and can be compressed with less error . For example , Deep Gradient Compression [ 1 ] takes this way . Thus , sending gradients and sending parameters may not have an explicit border .

All proof seems correct though I didn \u2019 t check very carefully . However , there are some issues : 1 . Compared to other asynchronous SGD methods , one advantage of BASGD is it doesn \u2019 t have the need of storing any samples on the server . However , I didn \u2019 t understand why such property is meaningful . The authors declare that it helps BASGD take less risk of privacy leakage . Noting the server store gradients on buffers and gradients may leak privacy [ 1 ] . If a third party can have access to the buffers , privacy leak can still happen . BASGD didn \u2019 t use techniques like differential privacy , so it seems ill-founded to say \u201c BASGD takes less risk of privacy leakage \u201d . 2.In my opinion , Theorem 1 doesn \u2019 t guarantee that BASGD is able to find a stationary point of $ F $ since the extra constant variance will not vanish when $ T $ goes infinity . By contrast , ZENO++ , a robust fully asynchronous SGD , could ensure convergence to a stationary point . This strikes me that the theorem is quite weak . Theorem 2 has the same problem . 3.It makes me feel strange to assume the gradient is biased ( Assumption 2 ) . For example , If we want to minimize $ F ( w ) $ but we use stochastic gradients computed from another $ \\tilde { F } ( w ) $ ( that is totally different from $ F ( w ) $ ) , could we still guarantee the algorithm converges to the stationary point of $ F ( w ) $ ? I am afraid the answer is NO . This thought experiment not only shows using biased gradients doesn \u2019 t help convergence but also shows Theorem 1 doesn \u2019 t guarantee the convergence of BASGD . 4.Some parts of the algorithm are not well explored . For example , how the performance of BASGD changes when we vary the value of $ q $ or the value of $ B $ . The experiment didn \u2019 t explore these aspects . Besides , Noting that the number of buffers $ B $ is quite important for good performance , however , there is no investigation on how $ B $ affects convergence and no suggestion on how to choose a proper $ B $ . In experiments , $ B $ is set in advance for no reason . [ 1 ] Ligeng Zhu , Zhijian Liu , and Song Han . Deep leakage from gradients . In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems , pages 14747\u201314756 , 2019 . I have read the authors ' response .

Considering the paper indeed explorees some aspects ( in theories and experiments ) of the use of buffers in asynchronous Byzantine Learning , I will improve my point to 5 .", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We greatly thank the reviewer for their summary and comments .

However , I didn \u2019 t understand why such property is meaningful . * * + In traditional machine learning , it is OK to store samples on the server . However , storing samples on the server may be no longer possible in federated learning ( FL ) . In the setting of FL , data should be keeping decentralized to mitigate many of the systemic privacy risks [ 1 ] . Therefore , it is difficult for the service provider ( server ) to store a large number of high-quality instances . + The reviewer said that storing gradients may also leak privacy . However , we would like to point out that it is still an open problem whether transmitting gradients will cause privacy leakage . There are also many recent works presenting or improving differential privacy [ 2 ] , which is a technique for privacy defense . Besides , homomorphic encryption is also a powerful privacy-defense technique [ 3 ] . + In conclusion , storing samples is not possible in the setting of federated learning , where workers are no longer under the control of service provider . In this case , Byzantine attacker is more likely to appear . Thus , we believe the property that BASGD does n't need storing any samples on the server is meaningful . * * Theorem 1 doesn \u2019 t guarantee that BASGD is able to find a stationary point of $ F $ , while Zeno++ could ensure convergence to a stationary point . * * + We have to point out that the convergence of Zeno++ [ 4 ] is under an assumption called Polyak-\u0141ojasiewicz ( PL ) inequality , which says $ \\exists \\mu > 0 , $ such that $ \\forall x , \\ f ( x ) -f ( x_ * ) \\leq\\frac { 1 } { 2\\mu } ||\\nabla f ( x ) ||^2 $ . This is a very strong assumption , under which there is only one stationary point ( global minimum $ x_ * $ ) . In addition , the norm of gradient $ ||\\nabla f ( x ) ||^2 $ is bounded below by $ 2\\mu [ f ( x ) -f ( x_ * ) ] $ . Many machine learning models do not satisfy this property . Besides , Zeno can be seen as the synchronous version of Zeno++ . The convergence proof of Zeno is under the general non-convex assumption , and there is also an extra constant term [ 5 ] . Many Byzantine learning methods use robust aggregation to obtain the gradient for updating . However , there is a gap between the aggregated result and the true global gradient $ \\nabla F ( w_t ) $ , because of the Byzantine attack . A biased gradient is used for parameter updating . Under this circumstance , it is hardly possible for the method to be guaranteed to converge to a stationary point . * * It makes me feel strange to assume the gradient is biased ( Assumption 2 ) . Using biased gradients doesn \u2019 t help convergence . * * + The biased gradient assumption is from the problem setting of federated learning , where the instances stored on different workers are non-IID . Each worker can only obtain a biased estimation of global gradient $ \\nabla F ( w_t ) $ based on its stored instances and the parameter $ w_t $ . As the review said , it is more difficult to guarantee the convergence when the gradient is biased , let alone there are Byzantine workers . Thus , we believe the theoretical result is acceptable that $ \\frac { 1 } { T } \\sum_ { t=0 } ^ { T-1 } \\mathbb { E } [ ||\\nabla F ( w_t ) || ] ^2 $ is bounded by a relative small positive value . * * The influence of buffer number $ B $ is not well explored . Besides , there is no investigation on how $ B $ affects convergence and no suggestion on how to choose a proper $ B $ . * * + The effect of $ B $ is empirically explored in the image classification experiments . The experimental results are presented in Figure 2 ( a ) and Figure 2 ( d ) . Many thanks for your constructive suggestion . We add the discussion of the effect of $ B $ and give suggestions for the choice of $ B $ at the end of Section 3 in the rebuttal revised version .

Its main contributions include generalization of the existing literature on Byzantine fault tolerance in distributed learning to incorporate the case of asynchronous learning . This generalization involves an algorithm , convergence analysis for the algorithm , and experimental results .

What is the meaning of $ t $ in this usage of the worker index ? 2.The writing of the paper could use some proofreading . Some of the sentences are hard to parse on first read , while some other sentences suffer from grammatical errors . As a specific example , I could not understand the meaning of `` Only when all buffers have got changed since the last SGD step , ... '' in Section 3.1 until I reread the main parts of the paper . 3.Related to the previous point , the discussion in Section 3.1 in general is hard to parse because of the notation and could benefit from revision . Also , $ m $ in this section is undefined up to this point in time and it is not clear what it means . 4.A number of aggregation functions have been proposed in prior works ( see e.g.Adversary-resilient distributed and decentralized statistical inference and machine learning : An overview of recent advances under the Byzantine threat model ) .

In the absence of such a speed-up , it is not clear if the authors are really providing guarantees that are useful for distributed learning . 6.It would be useful to discuss the impact of heavily delayed workers on the algorithm .

The sum of $ l_2 $ -norm form $ \\sum||y-y_i|| $ reveals that the objective function is $ 1 $ -Lipschitz w.r.t.each $ y_i $ and convex w.r.t. $ y $ .Thus , minima $ y^ * $ is $ 1 $ -Lipschitz w.r.t.each $ y_i $ , revealing that GeoMed satisfies Definition 4 . Also , the aggregated result of GeoMed can be bounded by the combination of loyal gradients , since loyal gradients make up the majority . the two inequalities in Definition 5 can be proved by using this property . + * * Bulyan * * uses an existing aggregation rule to obtain a new one .

We have modified the statement in the latest rebuttal revised version . + Besides , we would like to point out that the asynchrony is greatly damaged only when the buffer number $ B $ is close to $ m $ . It is true that the whole system will be slowed down by the slowest buffer . However , the probability of its occurrence is very small when $ B $ is not that large . More specifically , there are about $ ( m/B ) $ workers corresponds to each buffer . A buffer will become a straggler only when the $ ( m/B ) $ workers are all stragglers . The probability is relatively low when $ ( m/B ) $ is not too small . + In real-world federated learning settings , there may be hundreds of millions of mobile devices used as workers [ 1 ] , and the Byzantine worker number $ r $ will be much smaller than $ m $ .

They provide theoretical guarantees and some experiments on small-scale tasks . # # # # Originality Synchronous methods for byzantine learning enable one to compare communicated gradients with one another in order to filter out byzantine workers . When updates are asynchronous , such a procedure can not be employed because gradients are not necessarily communicated to the master node at the same time . Previous work on Asynchronous byzantine learning stores training instances on the master node to alleviate this issue . This work proposes instead to use gradient buffers on the server to eliminate the need to store training instances on the master node ; this is the main selling point of the algorithm , and deems the method sufficiently novel in my opinion . However , the motivation for avoiding storing instances on the master node is not well fleshed out in my opinion . Though the applications to Federated Learning are mentioned , updates are typically performed locally on-device and * parameters * are communicated back to the master , and therefore this method is not applicable to that setting . It is unclear exactly what the privacy concerns are , but I would suggest reworking the motivation exposition a little . # # # # Significance and Quality The method is actually quite nice and intuitive . The significance relates back to improving the motivation , but the method may be of sufficient interest to the community . * On the theory * : Note that the bounded gradient assumption is very strong ! when combined with the L-smoothness assumption , it implies a convergent subsequence a priori ! In short , it is like assuming ahead of time that the algorithm convergence . $ N^t_b $ is used in the main paper ( e.g. , page 5 ) , but is only defined in the appendix on page 14 . I would suggest including a one sentence description that these are the number of gradients stored in buffer $ b $ at iteration $ t $ . Under asynchrony or non-iid data , theorem 1 does not guarantee convergence to a stationary point\u2026 even with a diminishing step-size . Moreover , even with iid data and fully synchronicity and a diminishing step-size , the algorithm still does not converge to a stationary point due to the extra variance term on the r.h.s . I do not mean to criticize the results ; only to point out this fact . Moreover , these bounds are somewhat vacuous due to the presence of the non-degrading $ D $ gradient boundedness term on the r.h.s of Theorem 1 in the variance term . With L-smoothness and the assumption of $ D $ -bounded gradients , as I mentioned above , all iterates of any objective ( regardless of the algorithm ) , will remain with a ball of a stationary point , the size of which is proportional to $ D $ . ( To the authors credit , I have seen similar bounds in previous byzantine learning methods ) . For Theorem 2 , as I understand it , the $ \\alpha^ { 1/2 } $ term actually has a $ \\mathcal { O } ( 1/\\sqrt { T } ) $ dependence , so unless i \u2019 m missing something , why not remove the constant $ \\alpha $ and substitute in a quantity that decays with $ 1/\\sqrt { T } $ , and state the theorem results for all $ T \\geq $ some threshold ( to satisfy the current $ \\alpha < 1 $ constraint ) . this reformulation will make it clearer that the only lingering ( non-decaying factor ) is $ A_1 $ , which is due to gradient bias . More generally , I am curious if there is a way to correct for the convergence errors and improve the results to guarantee convergence to a stationary point ( and not some neighborhood thereof ) , given that a $ \\frac { 1 } { \\sqrt { T } } $ step-size is employed . # # # # Clarity Work is sufficiently clear .

In local updating methods , workers can also send the differences between the updated parameter and the original one .
