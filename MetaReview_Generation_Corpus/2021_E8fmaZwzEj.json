( The definition of shape and texture is according to [ 1 ] ) We \u2019 ve been thinking a lot and proposed four empirical pieces of evidence in Sec.3.2 , including the random shuffling experiment , the stylized-imagenet experiment , the shape-changed adversarial examples , and the robustness gains against standard adversarial perturbations and additive Gaussian noise . Note that we have tested on 5 common architectures , including ResNet-18 , ResNet-50 , DenseNet-121 , SENet-18 , and VGG-19 . First , we believe that the shape-changed adversarial examples can explicitly show the model is focusing on shape cues .

The adversarial examples are generated by modifying the original images based on the gradients , which indicates the place on original images pays attention to . For the Grad-CAM , it may not be suitable for use here , due to Grad-CAM would use a coarse heatmap of the same size as the convolutional feature maps and can not tell the edge of objects . In the random shuffle experiments , the image patches are randomly relocated . The global object shape is destroyed while the local texture is preserved . We perform the experiment and find the proposed ones consistently perform worse than standard ones . So we use it as evidence to indicate the proposed ones may more rely on shape information for predicting .

This work is motivated by this point . Combining with the recent finds that the current adversarial attack is mainly based on distorted texture , our work naturally can defend the attack . Beyond this point , we find the adversarial examples generated by the proposed method change the original object shape and may fool humans ( Fig.3 ) .This means the learned feature may be shape-aware and better aligned with human perception . Therefore , if there are related research or applications that need the learning model to be aligned with human perception , the proposed representation learning technique may help .

How is it related to the locality ? Why masking out spatial location in the conv layers would impact locality ? * * * A2 * * * : Texture is characterized by the spatial distribution of gray levels in a neighborhood [ 1 ] . Consider a local piece of an image containing a certain texture , the response will be strong if we apply a specific convolution kernel . For a CNN and a dataset , a filter can learn to have a strong response with certain texture since it repeats and the model would use it to recognize the class . This is also the story that goes on [ 2 ] , where a cat with elephant skin would be classified as an elephant . Here , we mask out certain neurons of filters in the bottom layer of a CNN , where those filters originally respond to detect texture [ 3 ] . For a masked filter ( 3x3 ) , the types of texture within a neighbor ( i.e.locality ) it can detect are limited . If we severely limit the texture it can detect , it has to seek another signal that can be responded via a multi-layer combination to classify . Sorry for we can only give an intuitive explanation at present . Do you think we should add the above intuitive analysis in the main paper ? Also , if you have further suggestions on the proper mathematical modeling , we are very glad to hear . [ 1 ] Machine vision , McGraw-hill New York1995 [ 2 ] ImageNet-trained CNNs are biased towards texture ; increasing shape bias improves accuracy and robustness , ICLR19 [ 3 ] Visualizing and understanding convolutional networks , ECCV2014 - * * * Q3 * * * : Intuitively , I think the spatial location where the defective neurons are placed would also impact the model 's behavior . It would be interesting to see how this would affect the model 's performance . Consider all defective neurons are on the edge or on the center of the filter . * * * A3 * * * : The mentioned point is very insightful and is also what we plan to study in the next step . When it comes to the spatial location , we consider the general spatial location of a feature map [ w , h , c ] , where w , h , c denote width , height , and channel . In the current ablation study , we compare with the defective channel and the shared mask , where both two cases can be viewed as the special cases of the proposed method . For the defective channel , we apply the defective neurons in a whole channel way and find there are no improvements on robustness . For the shared mask , we apply the defective neurons to share across different channels and find this would result in significant performance dropping . The two variants mainly study the channel dimension ( c of [ w , h , c ] ) . However , for the [ w , h ] , it is not easy to set some meaningful special cases . Note that , the filter would go over the whole feature map , thus we can not set all defective neurons on the edge or on the center of the filter . Will changes of [ w , h ] distributions result in different inductive biases ? The answer is Yes . Consider the results of gray-box attacks in A.6 , the proposed ones show superior performance than the standard one . This indicates that defective CNNs with different distributions of defective neurons would yield larger differences in learned representation than the standard ones . Therefore , we suggest studying [ w , h ] with the recent advances in NAS in the future , where we can search the distribution of defective neurons on [ w , h ] for downstream tasks ."}, {"review_id": "E8fmaZwzEj-2", "review_text": "Summary : The paper proposes a method to improve adversarial robustness of the current convolutional networks . The method is based on dropping outputs of a fraction of neurons . However , unlike in dropout the masks are kept fixed throughout training/inference and applied to the bottom layers of the network . This shifts the focus of the network away from texture and towards shape features resulting in the adversarial examples being fooling humans as well . I am inclined to vote for accepting the paper . The approach is novel as it tackles the issue of adversarial examples from a different angle than the usual denoising appraches , however , there is some room for improvement . Possible improvements and questions : - EGC-FL ( Yuan & He'20 ) performs equally well in the experiments , the authors argue that the main advantage of their method is the lower runtime but do not give any quantitative information on runtime . This information needs to be presented/commented upon in more detail . - writing/clarity can be improved in the experiments section , sometimes the claims seem a bit exaggerated ( e.g. , p8 saying `` This corroborates the phenomena ...

Therefore , if there are related research or applications that need the learning model to be aligned with human perception , the proposed representation learning technique may help .

How is it related to the locality ? Why masking out spatial location in the conv layers would impact locality ? * * * A2 * * * : Texture is characterized by the spatial distribution of gray levels in a neighborhood [ 1 ] . Consider a local piece of an image containing a certain texture , the response will be strong if we apply a specific convolution kernel . For a CNN and a dataset , a filter can learn to have a strong response with certain texture since it repeats and the model would use it to recognize the class . This is also the story that goes on [ 2 ] , where a cat with elephant skin would be classified as an elephant . Here , we mask out certain neurons of filters in the bottom layer of a CNN , where those filters originally respond to detect texture [ 3 ] . For a masked filter ( 3x3 ) , the types of texture within a neighbor ( i.e.locality ) it can detect are limited . If we severely limit the texture it can detect , it has to seek another signal that can be responded via a multi-layer combination to classify . Sorry for we can only give an intuitive explanation at present . Do you think we should add the above intuitive analysis in the main paper ? Also , if you have further suggestions on the proper mathematical modeling , we are very glad to hear . [ 1 ] Machine vision , McGraw-hill New York1995 [ 2 ] ImageNet-trained CNNs are biased towards texture ; increasing shape bias improves accuracy and robustness , ICLR19 [ 3 ] Visualizing and understanding convolutional networks , ECCV2014 - * * * Q3 * * * : Intuitively , I think the spatial location where the defective neurons are placed would also impact the model 's behavior . It would be interesting to see how this would affect the model 's performance . Consider all defective neurons are on the edge or on the center of the filter . * * * A3 * * * : The mentioned point is very insightful and is also what we plan to study in the next step . When it comes to the spatial location , we consider the general spatial location of a feature map [ w , h , c ] , where w , h , c denote width , height , and channel . In the current ablation study , we compare with the defective channel and the shared mask , where both two cases can be viewed as the special cases of the proposed method . For the defective channel , we apply the defective neurons in a whole channel way and find there are no improvements on robustness . For the shared mask , we apply the defective neurons to share across different channels and find this would result in significant performance dropping . The two variants mainly study the channel dimension ( c of [ w , h , c ] ) . However , for the [ w , h ] , it is not easy to set some meaningful special cases . Note that , the filter would go over the whole feature map , thus we can not set all defective neurons on the edge or on the center of the filter . Will changes of [ w , h ] distributions result in different inductive biases ? The answer is Yes . Consider the results of gray-box attacks in A.6 , the proposed ones show superior performance than the standard one . This indicates that defective CNNs with different distributions of defective neurons would yield larger differences in learned representation than the standard ones . Therefore , we suggest studying [ w , h ] with the recent advances in NAS in the future , where we can search the distribution of defective neurons on [ w , h ] for downstream tasks ."}, "2": {"review_id": "E8fmaZwzEj-2", "review_text": "Summary : The paper proposes a method to improve adversarial robustness of the current convolutional networks . The method is based on dropping outputs of a fraction of neurons . However , unlike in dropout the masks are kept fixed throughout training/inference and applied to the bottom layers of the network . This shifts the focus of the network away from texture and towards shape features resulting in the adversarial examples being fooling humans as well . I am inclined to vote for accepting the paper . The approach is novel as it tackles the issue of adversarial examples from a different angle than the usual denoising appraches , however , there is some room for improvement . Possible improvements and questions : - EGC-FL ( Yuan & He'20 ) performs equally well in the experiments , the authors argue that the main advantage of their method is the lower runtime but do not give any quantitative information on runtime . This information needs to be presented/commented upon in more detail . - writing/clarity can be improved in the experiments section , sometimes the claims seem a bit exaggerated ( e.g. , p8 saying `` This corroborates the phenomena ... '' when there was no result showing the said phenomena ) - the authors claim Defective CNNs can help saving a lot of computate and storage , is this hypothetical or is this a real option with current deep learning libraries ? - why in some tables ( 2 & 3 ) keep probability is 0.1 while in others ( 4 ) it is 0.3 & 0.5 ? Without explanation this seems like cherry picking . - from the experiment with shared defective masks it seems that the Defective CNNs actually encode the texture as well , the information is just spread across channels , or can the result be interpreted otherwise ? Small corrections : - Eqs 1,3,7 could use more standard notation for convolution to improve readability ( $ * $ instead of the current $ \\bigotimes_ { conv } $ ) - Eq 6 could spell out $ M_ { dp } $ as $ M_ { dropout } $ to be consistent with $ M_ { defect } $ in Eq 5 - Sec 3.2 : `` by both two CNNs '' - > `` by both of the CNNs '' - p5 : `` ... and Gaussian noises usually hard to affect '' - > `` ... and Gaussian noise usually hardly affect '' - Sec 4.1.1 : `` approaches try to erase '' - > `` approaches that try to erase '' - Sec 4.2 : `` the chose of '' - > `` the choice of '' and `` Without loss of generality '' - > `` Here '' and `` v.s '' - > `` vs .

We believe we can address your concerns below and would incorporate updates in the revised version . * * * Q1 * * * : EGC-FL ( Yuan & He'20 ) performs equally well in the experiments , the authors argue that the main advantage of their method is the lower runtime but do not give any quantitative information on runtime .

According to the original paper [ 1 ] , we find their method would cost extra time to collect adversarial examples ( e.g.generated adversarial examples with 8 step size would need 8 times extra time ) , and run 4 times inner loops that the inference time is 4 times that of our method . Since they do not release code as we will do , we can not compare the specific runtime with them at this time .

'' when there was no result showing the said phenomena . * * * A2 * * * : For the specific case , we actually have the phenomenon that applying defective layers to bottom layers can achieve better performance while the top layers can not . We want to argue this finding is consistent with our tuition and also the literature . We \u2019 ve rewritten this paragraph now .

The index operations can help avoid computing the value of the deactivated neurons no matter what the input is , thus help save the computation and storage cost . Moreover , the proposed principle may be naturally integrated into FPGA for edge-computing . -- * * * Q4 * * * : Why in some tables ( 2 & 3 ) the probability is 0.1 while in others ( 4 ) it is 0.3 & 0.5 ? * * * A4 * * * : We want to note that it is enough to show our improvements with either 0.5 or 0.3 in Table 4 . The reason why we show the results of both 0.3 and 0.5 is to show the trend of robustness increases as the keep probability becomes smaller . Since there is a trade-off between the accuracy and robustness ( discussed in Sec.4.2 and A.9 ) , we use 0.1 to compare with the SOTA methods . We would make this clear in the revision .

You can see the improvements in the robustness in Table 5 . But , such monotone patterns across channels would cause the accuracy to significantly drop . -- Thanks for the detailed corrections , we 've fixed them in revision ."}}
