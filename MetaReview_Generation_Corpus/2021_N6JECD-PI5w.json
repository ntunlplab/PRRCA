Their approach trains a 2 layer fully-connected neural network which takes as input the output from the pretrained model and outputs a new , `` debiased '' representation . This model is trained by minimizing the InfoNCE between the representation produced of original sentence and the representation of that same sentence with some tokens replaced with differently-biased tokens ( e.g . `` his '' - > `` hers '' ) . This paper also introduces a regularizer which minimizes the CLUB between the generated representation and a word embedding for a biased token . Generally this paper is clearly written , addressing an interesting problem , presents some relevant supporting experiments , and seems original ( I 'm less familiar with other debiasing work , so I leave a better originality estimate up to the other reviewers ) . The regularizer is described as a neural network , but that seems unnecessary . If it 's parameterized as a neural network , and the weights are updated , then I think this is just part of the model and not really a regularizer . In addition , the motivation does n't seem great -- it 's not clear that we should be directly comparing ( the mutual information of ) a single word embedding and a contextual word embedding ( which is built from the full sentence ) . All that said , empirically it seems to work well at debiasing the word embeddings , so it 's a valuable contribution .

The authors proposed to train a neural network which takes the sentence representations of a pretrained NLP model as input and outputs the unbiased representations . The neural network is trained by maximizing the mutual information between a sentence and its \u201c counterpart sentence \u201d , which is automatically generated by replacing sensitive words by other values ( e.g.replacing \u201c he \u201d with \u201c she \u201d ) . Moreover , the network can be further trained by minimizing the mutual information between the sentence representation and its sensitive word representation . The experiments show that the proposed method can effectively reduce bias while achieving better downstream task performance of the pretrained model . Strengths : - The studied research problem is important and would have a strong social impact . - The proposed methodology is well-motivated and generally reasonable . - The experimental results show strong performance Weakness : - The data augmentation process seems to require pairs of replaceable words to be available . The research problem of mitigating social bias in NLP models is important to our community and can have strong social impact . Despite the popularity of pretrained NLP models , there are limited studies on fairness of BERT-like models . Therefore , I think this work is relatively novel on this specific topic . The high-level intuitions of the proposed methodology is reasonable . I find both the applied losses quite intuitive . There are some minor limitations in the proposed method . For example , in the data augmentation process , it seems that replaceable words in different directions $ r_j ( \\cdot ) $ need to be available . This is more strict than having a list of words for each direction in each topic : \u201c boy \u201d can be replaceable with \u201c girl \u201d , but not necessarily \u201c she \u201d or \u201c her \u201d . For some common topics , of course , it may not be difficult to find such resources . However , for less common social topics or topics with many values ( e.g. , countries , regions ) , it could be hard to construct such a lexicon . I think it would be better if the authors experiment their methods with less restrictive constraints on what are replaceable ( e.g. , allowing \u201c boy \u201d to be replaced by \u201c her \u201d ) and see if the performances would be severely hurt . Alternatively , the authors can discuss how to automatically construct $ r_j ( \\cdot ) $ . I have a question about the instantiation of Eq ( 5 ) . Since the authors already assume that they have replaceable words $ r_j ( \\cdot ) $ available for any socially sensitive words , would it be better to minimize $ q_ { \\theta } ( w_i^p|d_i ) $ with $ q_ { \\theta } ( r_j ( w_i^p ) |d_i ) $ for all directions $ j $ \u2019 s ? Currently it seems like the negatives are basically other words in the same batch , which are not necessarily in the same direction . The experiments conducted show pretty strong performance , where the proposed methods achieve better debiasing performances and better classification performances . Some additional experiments could provide more insights . For example , how about using more than one layer of fully-connected neural networks for the fair filter ? Generally , I recommend acceptance of this paper .", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "reply_text": "Thank you for your insightful comments . For your concerns : * * Replaceable Words : * * We agree that the current augmentation scheme under pre-defined replaceable words has some limitations . For undefined sensitive words from less common social topics , our model needs to add them manually case-by-case . However , the size of the word dictionary is finite , which makes it feasible to obtain a sufficient sensitive word list theoretically . The reviewer 's suggestion is also practically insightful , that we may use words from different directions but not exactly the same meaning to do the augmentation ( e.g.using `` her '' to replace `` boy '' ) . We will study this in future work . * * Instantiation in Eq ( 5 ) : * * Our current objective in Eq ( 5 ) . is strictly following the CLUB mutual information upper bound , which practically minimizes the correlation between word embeddings and debiased sentence embeddings in each data batch . The reviewer provided a good suggestion that we can choose negative samples of word embeddings based on the replaceable words instead of the word embeddings in the same batch . This negative sampling strategy may not be apparently explained by mutual information minimization , but it is a good empirical direction . We will conduct experiments for it in future work . * * Additional Experiments : * * We would like to try more complex networks ' performance in the future to achieve a better trade-off between debiasing and downstream task performance ."}, {"review_id": "N6JECD-PI5w-2", "review_text": "The paper proposes a method for debiasing pretrained sentence representations .
