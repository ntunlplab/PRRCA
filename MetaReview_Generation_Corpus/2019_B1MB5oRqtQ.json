There could be different parameters for each policy in the gradient (though some parameter sharing could be possible), and computing this gradient would be prohibitive. The solution is to just use the most recent parameters, but then the gradients become off-policy again without motivation for why this is acceptable. This approximation needs to be better justified. \n\nAs an additional point, there are other off-policy policy gradient methods, than just DPG. The authors could consider comparing to these strategies (which can use replay buffers) and explain why the proposed strategy provides benefits beyond these. What is inadequate about these methods? Further motivation is needed for the proposed strategy. This is additionally true because the proposed strategy requires entire sampled trajectories for a fixed policy (to make the policy gradient sound, with weighting dpi_n(s)), whereas DPG and other off-policy AC methods do not need that.", "reviews": [{"review_id": "B1MB5oRqtQ-0", "review_text": "The paper tries to bring together the replay buffer and on-policy method.

We 've made modifications throughout the text to reflect this statement . As it is said in ( Sutton & Barto , Reinforcement Learning : An Introduction , 2018 ) : \u201c All learning control methods face a dilemma : They seek to learn action values conditional on subsequent optimal behavior , but they need to behave non-optimally in order to explore all actions ( to find the optimal actions ) . How can they learn about the optimal policy while behaving according to an exploratory policy ? The on-policy approach in the preceding section is actually a compromise\u2014it learns action values not for the optimal policy , but for a near-optimal policy that still explores . A more straightforward approach is to use two policies , one that is learned about and that becomes the optimal policy , and one that is more exploratory and is used to generate behavior . The policy being learned about is called the target policy , and the policy used to generate behavior is called the behavior policy . In this case we say that learning is from data \u201c off \u201d the target policy , and the overall process is termed off-policy learning . \u201c The question we pose in the paper is : maintaining the ability of on-policy learning to use the actual policy , would it be possible to augment it with the idea of replay buffers ? In the proposed method , we do not use the separate behaviour policy to generate behaviour ; instead we maintain the buffer of previous policies \u2019 outcomes . In the introduction , we have also put some emphasis on recent efforts to put together on-policy and off-policy learning ( Nachum et al , TRUST-PCL : an off-policy trust region method for continuous control , ICLR , 2018 ; Gu et al , Interpolated Policy Gradient : Merging On-Policy and Off-Policy Gradient Estimation for Deep Reinforcement Learning , NIPS 2017 ) . \u201c In the experiment part , the replay buffer size is often very tiny , e.g. , 3 or 5 . The reviewer believes there may be something wrong in the experiment setting . Or if the reviewer understood it incorrectly , please clarify the reason behind such a tiny replay buffer. \u201d The size of the replay buffer , in our case , is measured in terms of the number of policies , not actions ( i.e.it would mean that given that we collect at least 1000 actions from a single policy as outlined in appendix A , buffer size 3 would mean samples from three policies , i.e.no less than 3000 samples in the buffer ) . We have made sure that this is evident the text of the paper ( see the revised experimental section ) . The motivation behind the notion of the replay buffer in this paper is different from the one for the state-of-the art off-policy replay buffers ( like DDPG ) . Rather than leveraging upon a multitude of previous policies , we use replay buffers to better approximate the vicinity of the current policy within the trust region policy optimisation approach and therefore save the simulation steps numbers . We believe that the novelty of our approach is that using the formulation of the generalised Q- and advantage functions ( see Equations ( 8 ) - ( 12 ) ) we avoid the restriction of policy stationarity , imposed in policy gradient theorem which is often used for on-policy learning ( Sutton et al , 2000 ) . We \u2019 ve amended the description around Equations ( 8 ) - ( 12 ) to reflect this . Theorem 2 highlights the reason behind a small replay buffer : as it is said in the comments below the theorem , \u201c given the continuous value function approximator it reveals that the closer are the policies , within a few trust regions radii , the smaller will be the bias \u201d in advantage function approximation .

To do this they extend the definition of the Q function to multiple policies where the Q_pi bar is then the expectation over the several policies. They propose the same for the value function and consequently the advantage function. In my opinion this is some interesting work, but there are some details that are not clear to me, so i have several questions. 1. Why is it necessary to define these generalized notions of the Q, Value and Advantage functions? You motivate this by the fact the samples stored in the replay buffer will be generated by different policies, i.e. by differently parametrized policies at a certain time step. But this also holds almost all algorithms using replay buffers. Could you plese explain this part further? 2. In eq. (26) you introduce the parameter alpha as a sort of Lagrange multiplier to turn the unconstrained optimization problem defined by TRPO into a constrained one. This is was also proposed early by Schulman et al. in Proximal Policy Optimization. Yet, it is not cited or referenced. In the discussion of the experimental results go further into this. Please explain this part in more detail. 3. Another point of your work is the learnable diagonal covariance matrix. How can you be sure that the improvements you show are due to the replay buffers and not due to learning these? Or learning covariance in combination with the penalty term alpha? 4.

We \u2019 ve modified the description accordingly . Our proposal has happened to come independently from Schulman et al , although we believe it is because this technique seems to be the natural solution for constrained optimisation . The reason behind using this technique is to move away from heuristically defined dynamic estimation of the step size to make the problem fit the constraints , such as the one featured in ACKTR , and switch to one universal hyperparameter . In Proximal Policy Optimisation ( see Section 4 of Schulman et al , 2017 ) , the ( heuristic ) adaptive coefficient is still used . Our response to the reviewer 1 states that `` The point behind the barrier function is to remove heuristic adjustments of the step parameter in optimisation . In TRPO and ACKTR , the step size is changed heuristically in order to make the solution fit the constraint ; with the barrier function , we can perform the optimisation just with a fixed step size 0.01 applied to all tasks ( to make sure we meet the repeatability requirements , we state these parameters in Appendix A ) . For PPO , the heuristic update rules for penalisation coefficient look like : if constraint < constraint_target / 1.5 , step_size < - step_size/2 ; if constraint > constraint_target * 1.5 , step_size < - step_size * 2 ( it is our understanding that this procedure is based upon the heuristic rather than has theoretical background ) . We do not use it and use fixed barrier function constraint 100 .

And what does $\\nabla_\\theta \\pi_n$ mean? Does $\\pi_n$ uses $\\theta$ for computation? One of the problems of using replay buffers in on-policy algorithms is that the stationary distribution of states changes as policy changes, and at least the writing doesn't make it clear on how to solve distribution mismatching issue. Further explanation on Eq (25) might help. If the distributions of states are assumed to match, then the joint distribution of states and actions may mismatch so additional importance sampling might help, as suggested in [1] Eq (3). Another problem is on the barrier function. In Eq (26), if we only evaluate $\\rho_b(\\theta)$ (or its gradient w.r.t. $\\theta$) at the point $\\theta_old$, it doesn't differ with or without the barrier function. So in order to show the barrier function helps, we must evaluate $\\rho_b(\\theta)$ (or its gradient) at a point $\\theta \\neq \\theta_old$. As far as I know, the underlying optimizer, K-FAC, just evaluates the objective's (i.e., $\\rho_b$) gradients at $\\theta_old$. Both Conjugate Gradient (CG), which TRPO uses, and K-FAC are trying to solve $F^{-1} g$ where $g$ is the gradient of the objective at the current point. The experiments show significant improvement over TRPO/DDPG. However, some experiments are also expected. 1. How is the proposed algorithm compared to PPO or Trust PCL? 2. How does the barrier function help? More importantly, what's the comparison of the barrier function to [1] Eq (5)? The proposed algorithm seems more like a variant of ACKTR instead of TRPO since line search is missing in the proposed algorithm and the underlying optimizer is K-FAC instead of CG.

As we say in the text below this equation , `` To practically implement this gradient , we substitute the parameters $ \\theta^\\pi $ , derived from the latest policy for the replay buffer , instead of joint $ \\theta $ parameters assuming that the parameters would not deviate far from each other due to the trust region restrictions ; it is still possible to calculate the estimation of $ \\tilde { A } ^ { \\pi_n } ( s^n_t , a^n_t ) $ for each policy using Equation ( \\ref { AdvantageEstimator } ) as these policies are observed. `` \u201c Another problem is on the barrier function .

Both Conjugate Gradient ( CG ) , which TRPO uses , and K-FAC are trying to solve $ F^ { -1 } g $ where $ g $ is the gradient of the objective at the current point . \u201c It is also our understanding that the gradient in K-FAC is estimated at the current point only . That is why , when we use the K-FAC optimiser in practice for policy update , we do not just use it for one iteration but for several ( N_ITER_PL_UPDATE = 10 ) iterations . The experiments show significant improvement over TRPO/DDPG . However , some experiments are also expected . `` 1.How is the proposed algorithm compared to PPO or Trust PCL ? `` We \u2019 ve added the experimental results to compare the improvement over PPO ( see Figure 1 ) . `` 2.How does the barrier function help ? More importantly , what 's the comparison of the barrier function to [ 1 ] Eq ( 5 ) ? `` The point behind the barrier function is to remove heuristic adjustments of the step parameter in optimisation . In TRPO and ACKTR , the step size is changed heuristically in order to make the solution fit the constraint ; with the barrier function , we can perform the optimisation just with a fixed step size 0.01 applied to all tasks ( to make sure we meet the repeatability requirements , we state these parameters in Appendix A ) . For PPO , the heuristic update rules for penalisation coefficient look like : if constraint < constraint_target / 1.5 , step_size < - step_size/2 ; if constraint > constraint_target * 1.5 , step_size < - step_size * 2 ( it is our understanding that this procedure is based upon the heuristic rather than has theoretical background ) . We do not use it and use fixed barrier function constraint 100 . Our point is that we maintain the performance without these heuristics , just with the hyperparameters , universal for all tasks . \u201c The proposed algorithm seems more like a variant of ACKTR instead of TRPO since line search is missing in the proposed algorithm and the underlying optimizer is K-FAC instead of CG. \u201d We agree with the statement that the methodology is closer to ACKTR while it differs significantly in various aspects ( it includes barrier function optimisation , diagonal matrix adjustment , and , which is the main point of the paper , the replay buffer for TRPO ) ; as it is outlined in Algorithm 1 , we use the K-FAC optimiser only for the policy gradient optimisation , while for the value function we use the Adam method , as we have seen no evidence of advantage of using K-FAC for the value function ."}}
