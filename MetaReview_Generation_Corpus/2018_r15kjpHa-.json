The authors have not provided rebuttals, but merely perfunctory generic responses.\n\nI think the most important criticism is that the approach is \"very ad-hoc.\"  I would encourage the authors to consider more principled ways of automatically designing reward functions, like for example, Inverse Reinforcement Learning, in which you start with a good agent behavior policy, and then estimate a reward function for which the behavior policy maximizes the reward function.", "reviews": [{"review_id": "r15kjpHa--0", "review_text": "The authors suggest using a mixture of shared and individual rewards within a MARL environment to induce cooperation among independent agents. They show that on their specific application this can lead to a better overall global performance than purely sharing the global signal, or using just the independent rewards. The paper is a little too focused on the packet routing example domain and fails to deliver much in terms of a general theory of reward design for cooperative behaviours beyond showing that mixed rewards can lead to improved results in their domain. They discuss what and how rewards, and this could be made more formal, as well as (at the very least) some guiding principles to follow when mixing rewards. It feels like there is a missing section between sections 2 and 3, where this methodological content could be described. The rest of the paper has similar issues, with key intuition and concepts either missing entirely or under-represented. The technical content often assumes that the reader is familiar with certain terms, and it is difficult to see what meaningful conclusions can be drawn from the evaluation. On a minor note, the use of the term cooperative in this paper could be better defined. In game theory, cooperative games are those in which agents share rewards. Non-cooperative (game theory) games are those where agents have general reward signals (not necessarily cooperature or adversarial). Conventionally (yes there is existing reward design/shaping literature for MARL) people have used the same terms in MARL. Perhaps the authors could define their approach as weakly cooperative, or emergent cooperation. The related work could be better described. There are existing papers on MARL and the issues with cooperation among independent learners, and this could be referenced. This includes reward shaping and reward potential. I would also have expected to see brief mention of empowerment in this section too (the agent favouring states where it has the power to control outcomes in an information theoretic sense), as an underyling principle for intrinsic reward.
