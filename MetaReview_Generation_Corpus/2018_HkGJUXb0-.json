The paper investigates the mathematical properties of this decomposition and provides synthetic experiments. There was some debate, with the reviewers, about the novelty and impact of this method, where overall the feeling was this work was too preliminary to be accepted. The idea, from my understanding, is interesting and would benefit from discussion at the workshop track, but the authors are investigated to make a stronger case for the novelty of this method in any further work and, in particular, to consider showing empirical improvement on \"real\" data where TT methods are currently applied.", "reviews": [{"review_id": "HkGJUXb0--0", "review_text": "The paper addresses the problem of tensor decomposition which is relevant and interesting. The paper proposes Tensor Ring (TR) decomposition which improves over and bases on the Tensor Train (TT) decomposition method. TT decomposes a tensor in to a sequences of latent tensors where the first and last tensors are a 2D matrices. The proposed TR method generalizes TT in that the first and last tensors are also 3rd-order tensors instead of 2nd-order. I think such generalization is interesting but the innovation seems to be very limited. The paper develops three different kinds of solvers for TR decomposition, i.e., SVD, ALS and SGD. All of these are well known methods. Finally, the paper provides experimental results on synthetic data (3 oscillated functions) and image data (few sampled images). I think the paper could be greatly improved by providing more experiments and ablations to validate the benefits of the proposed methods. Please refer to below for more comments and questions. -- The rating has been updated. Pros: 1. The topic is interesting. 2. The generalization over TT makes sense. Cons: 1. The writing of the paper could be improved and more clear: the conclusions on inner product and F-norm can be integrated into \"Theorem 5\". And those \"theorems\" in section 4 are just some properties from previous definitions; they are not theorems. 2. The property of TR decomposition is that the tensors can be shifted (circular invariance). This is an interesting property and it seems to be the major strength of TR over TT. I think the paper could be significantly improved by providing more applications of this property in both theory and experiments. 3. As the number of latent tensors increase, the ALS method becomes much worse approximation of the original optimization. Any insights or results on the optimization performance vs. the number of latent tensors? 4. Also, the paper mentions Eq. 5 (ALS) is optimized by solving d subproblems alternatively. I think this only contains a single round of optimization. Should ALS be applied repeated (each round solves d problems) until convergence? 5. What is the memory consumption for different solvers? 6. SGD also needs to update at least d times for all d latent tensors. Why is the complexity O(r^3) independent of the parameter d? 7. The ALS is so slow (if looking at the results in section 5.1), which becomes not practical. The experimental part could be improved by providing more results and description about a guidance on how to choose from different solvers. 8. What does \"iteration\" mean in experimental results such as table 2? Different algorithms have different cost for \"each iteration\" so comparing that seems not fair. The results could make more sense by providing total time consumptions and time cost per iteration. also applies to table 4. 9. Why is the \\epsion in table 3 not consistent? Why not choose \\epsion = 9e-4 and \\epsilon=2e-15 for tensorization? 10. Also, table 3 could be greatly improved by providing more ablations such as results for (n=16, d=8), (n=4, d=4), etc. That could help readers to better understand the effect of TR. 11. Section 5.3 could be improved by providing a curve (compression vs. error) instead of just providing a table of sampled operating points. 12. The paper mentions the application of image representation but only experiment on 32x32 images. How does the proposed method handle large images? Otherwise, it does not seem to be a practical application. 13. Figure 5: Are the RSE measures computed over the whole CIFAR-10 dataset or the displayed images?

The proposed TR generalizes TT not only in that the first and last tensors are 3rd-order instead of 2nd-order , but also a tensor contraction ( link ) between the first tensor and last tensor is added . This additional operation makes TR having essentially different computation principle and mathematical properties . As a result , TR has several advantages over TT such as enhanced representation ability , smaller ranks than TT , circular permutation invariance . Since there is a loop connection in TR , the developments of TR-SVD and TR-BALS are not trivial as compared to TT . In particular , BALS enables us to automatically determine the rank between the first and last cores , which is not possible in the TT model . Although ALS and SGD are well-known methods , our novelty is how we can apply these standard techniques to solve TR decomposition . The most notable experiment is to represent an image by using our proposed tensorization and tensor decomposition ( sec.5.2 ) .By converting an image to 4th , 8th , and 16th order tensors , TT/TR can represent it by using much less parameters than gold standard SVD on the original matrix . In addition , TR needs 0.56 times parameters of TT ( see Table 4 in revision ) . This is the first time to show significant advantages of artificially converting a 2D matrix ( real image ) to a high-order tensor . As suggested by AnonReviewer5 , we added a new experiment on two datasets in our revision ( Sec.5.4 ) .TTs/TRs are applied to approximate a dense weight matrix of fully connected layers in neural networks . The results show that TR can always achieve better training and testing error than TT by using different ranks . TR-layer can achieve much better compression rate than TT-layer under the same level of test error . In particular , the compression factor of parameters by using TR is up to 1300 times . Response to Cons : 1 . We improved the clarity of the paper as AnonReviewer5 suggested . 2.In the revised manuscript , we added an experiment to demonstrate the benefit of this property ( see Sec.5.1 and Table 2 ) . 3.In Table 3 , as the number of latent tensors increases , the original tensor data has totally different size , leading to a slow convergence rate of ALS . In addition , ALS is prone to get stuck in a local minimum . Thus , for large-scale tensors , TR-SGD would be more promising . Here , we mainly show TR-SGD can achieve similar approximation to TR-ALS by using partially observed tensor data . 4.ALS should be applied repeatedly till convergence . We mentioned this in our revision . 5.We provide memory costs for different solvers in our revision ( Sec.3.3 ) .6.The complexity of TR-SGD should be O ( d^2r^3 ) for each data point . 7.In Sec.5.1 , TT-ALS is so slow due to many iterations for convergence , while TT-SVD is a non-iterative method . We provided discussions and descriptions about how to choose an appropriate solver in our revision ( Sec.3.3 ) .8. \u201c Iteration \u201d in Tables 3 and 5 should be changed to \u201c Epoch \u201d , which indicates how many times the whole data tensor is used for optimization . The main point is that TR-SGD can achieve similar error by using 1 % of tensor elements . For each epoch , the cost of TR-ALS is O ( Ndr^4+dr^6 ) , while the cost of TR-SGD is O ( Nd^2r^3 ) . 9.In Table 3 , \\epsilon is the real achieved error , we choose \\epsilon = 1e-1 , 1e-2 , 1e-3 , 1e-15 for all methods , but it is impossible to obtain exactly the same error due to discrete value of ranks . 10.In Table 4 , all results are obtained by using the same image data ( 256x256 ) , and thus ( n=16 , d=8 ) and ( n=4 , d=4 ) are impossible , because 16^8 and 4^4 are not equal to 256^2 . 11.We added more experiments shown in Figure 5 in our revision as suggested by AnonReviewer5 . 12.The size of each sample is not a crucial factor , because we consider the whole dataset as one tensor . We also performed experiments on a larger image ( 256 x 256 ) in Sec.5.2.The tensor in Sec.5.3 is of size 1000 x 32 x 32 ( 1million entries ) . Although each image is small , a tensor of the whole dataset is large . In Appendix , the COIL-100 dataset is a tensor of size 32 x 32 x 3 x 7200 ( 22 million entries ) and the KTH dataset is of size 20 x 20 x 32 x 600 ( 7 million entries ) . These tensors are large enough for practical applications .
