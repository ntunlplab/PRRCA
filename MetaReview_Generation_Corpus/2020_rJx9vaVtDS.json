For example, after the rebuttal one reviewer remained unconvinced regarding explanations for why the proposed method is likely to learn the full potential outcome distribution.

(2018) claims that optimizing a GAN with this G and D, the generator will become better and better at estimating accurate counterfactual outcomes. Looking at the objective function in Eq.

Of course, a by-product of learning the treatment selection bias is distinguishing yf from ycf, however, this doesn\u2019t mean that G did a good job at generating an accurate estimation of ycf. In summary, it seems that the adversarial training designed in GANITE and consequently DRGAN provide no advantage in terms of accurate estimation of counterfactuals, which in turn, nullifies the entire claimed contribution of these two works.

GANITE: Estimation of individualized treatment effects using generative adversarial nets. ********UPDATE after reading the rebuttal******** Thank you for your response. Still, there are multiple issues with this reasoning that you need to address. $X$ is way more expressive than the added binary input that you described in the example. While the binary input is sampled from a Uniform distribution (either \u00bd or \u2154), $Pr(X|t=1)$ and $Pr(X|t=1)$ distributions are often Gaussian (certainly not Uniform) and therefore, embed a lot more information about which instances should receive which treatment. Therefore, $X$ is way more informative about selection bias than your binary input is about the image being fake/real. Do not underestimate this!! It is true that the discriminator reaches its maximum loss when the generator\u2019s estimation of the counterfactual is spot on. That is, it simply predicts the administered treatment according to the treatment selection bias. You need to show, however, that this maxima is global. Otherwise, there could be infinite maximas with the same loss; e.g., why not simply $Y^{factual} = Y^{counterfactual}$ does not reach this maxima? You also need to show that the added information to $X$ by concatenating it with the factual outcome plus the generator\u2019s estimation of the counterfactual outcome do improve prediction of the administered treatment -- i.e., minimizing the discriminator loss. To summarize, I am not yet convinced that either GANITE or DRGAN do what they claim. ", "rating": "1: Reject", "reply_text": "Thank you very much for your review ! The objective function in Eq . ( 4 ) from GANITE will result in a discriminator that will use ALL discriminatory variables ( within ( x , y ) ) to distinguish factual from counterfactual outcomes . This means that while the discriminator will indeed use the treatment bias to distinguish between outcomes , it will also use the generated outcomes and how realistic they are to distinguish between them . When the generated outcomes are perfect ( i.e.are being generated according to the true counterfactual distribution ) then the discriminator will reduce to JUST using the treatment bias . However , if the generated outcomes are not good then the discriminator can do even better than the treatment bias by also incorporating the outcomes . Therefore , the generator can reduce its loss ( with respect to the discriminator ) by generating more realistic outcomes . Ultimately what is important is not what the discriminator can or can not distinguish but rather what it can use to distinguish , and whether or not the generator can affect this by generating more realistic outcomes . To illustrate this point we can consider a toy example using vanilla GANs . Suppose that during the training of a vanilla GAN , in addition to giving as input to the discriminator the real or fake image , we also pass a binary input . For real images , we randomly generate this binary input by setting it to 0 or 1 with equal probability . For fake images , we do this by setting it to 0 with probability \u2154 and to 1 with prob . \u2153 .This setup directly emulates the treatment bias in our setting - this 0 or 1 can not be affected by the generator ( it depends only on whether the image is real or fake , not the pixel-values of the image itself , just as the treatment bias in GANITE and DRGAN depend only on the features and not on the generated counterfactuals ) . While the addition of these 0s and 1s might affect training ( such as speed or stability ) , the optimal solution , which is for the generator to generate images from the true distribution is unchanged . As in our case , the min-max game played by the generator and discriminator will ultimately converge to a different value ( rather than the -log4 found in the original GAN paper ) but the learned generator will still be the same .

The idea is to generate counterfactual dose-response curves using the generator that can fool the discriminator that tries to distinguish between factual data and counterfactual data. Factual data along with counterfactual data generated by the GAN can then be used for heterogeneous causal effect estimation. To tailor to this specific heterogeneous dose-response curve estimation problem, the paper makes various architectural design modification from a regular GAN, such as using factual predictive performance as regularization, multitask for treatment option and dosage in the generator, hierarchical decomposition of the dose and response prediction in the discriminator, and permutation invariance when predicting the dosage-response curves for various treatment in the discriminator. These design choices are reasonably explained and the empirical gains due to these design choices are well documented (Table 2). A few concerns: 1. It is unclear why using a GAN that seeks to produce samples that are indistinguishable from the factual ones will be the right way to synthesize counterfactual samples. Intuition and further justification need to be provided. Related to this concern, do the authors also implicitly reason under the consistency assumption (the observed/factual samples are the realizations potential outcomes of the corresponding treatment-dosage pairs in the potential outcome framework) ? If so, the authors should also reflect that in their list of assumptions. 2. It is also unclear what kind of theoretical guarantees the proposed method could deliver. Since the setting considered by the paper is to formally estimate the dosage-response effect, such guarantees, while potentially challenging to derive, are nonetheless crucial to better understand the circumstances under which the proposed method is reliable/unreliable. This is especially the case given the elusive use of GAN to generate counterfactual outcomes as mentioned in the previous concern. 3. It will also be interesting to see whether the proposed method can be degenerated to handle simpler cases such as heterogeneous treatment effect estimation of binary treatment. Or alternatively, when there is only one treatment option, where when treated there is a dosage-response curve while when not treated the dosage is zero. Related to this question, is this also the way to parameterize whether a subject receives a treatment or not in the model?

Intuitively , if the generator is generating counterfactuals according to the true distribution of the counterfactuals then the \u201c best \u201d the discriminator can do is distinguish the factual treatment using the features alone ( essentially guessing the correct treatment according to the treatment bias ) .

However , the minimum dosage does not necessarily have to correspond to the treatment not being given , it may instead correspond to the smallest possible positive dosage that could be administered ( perhaps due to practical reasons or due to clinical guidelines ) . If the possibility of no treatment needed to be considered , then this would be the same as incorporating an additional treatment that does not come with a dosage parameter - this can easily be done within our model . Such treatments will not need a dosage discriminator but will be passed to the treatment discriminator . A head can be added to the generator for each such non-dosage treatment but will not need to take dosage as an input . As for how treatments are encoded within our model , the factual treatment is one-hot encoded and is concatenated with the dosage parameter and other features .

To begin with , individualized dose-response estimation represents a significantly more complex problem than estimating individualized effects of binary and categorical treatments . Compared to the binary treatment setting where only one counterfactual needs to be estimated ( see Figure 1 ) , for the dose-response setting , a potentially infinite number of counterfactuals need to be estimated ( due to the continuous nature of the treatment dosage ) . GANITE can only be used to estimate counterfactuals for multiple treatments . Our method ( DRGAN ) uses the adversarial training idea from GANITE as a building block .
