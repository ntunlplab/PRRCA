There was some discussion over whether or not a comparison with AutoAugment would be fair, the proposed method is theoretically motivated whereas AutoAugment takes significant compute to train. I agree with the authors that if the method doesn't outperform AutoAugment on CIFAR, this would not necessarily invalidate their results.

I feel like the notations used in the introduction is repeated in the beginning of the section 3 .

The bias is defined as the difference between the label of the augmented instance and original instance . In reality , there might be strong bias in the label-preserving augmentations , i.e.Jigsaw.I would like to get a clarification on this . 4.The paper only shows experiments only on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 . Potential positive results on ImageNet would have made the paper much convincing and stronger . This is because , in the past , many augmentation methods , i.e.CutOut , has been shown to perform well on CIFAR10/100 but not on ImageNet . 5.The improvements on CIFAR10/CIFAR100 are very marginal . There exists better data augmentation techniques , i.e.auto-augment , yielding better results on CIFAR10/100 . It would be nice to include the results from different augmentation techniques into the experiments sections . 6.Similar to my point at 3 , do the authors think that their method would work on an another augmentation method , i.e.jigsaw , that preserves the label ? Or is it only constrained for the ones that changes the label . 7.What are the disadvantages of the proposed methods ? What kind of complexity do they add , i.e.increased training complexity ? 8.I understand that the authors try to show that in the case of very strong augmentations ( mixup with 10 images ) , they can improve the baseline mixup augmentation .
