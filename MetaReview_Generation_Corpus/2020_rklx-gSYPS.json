The ideal preconditioning is given by the Fenchel conjugate of the optimization function. This paper uses a supervised scenario to find the ideal preconditioning. The authors point out the importance of the sampling distribution then and propose a sampling scheme using the uniform distribution on the space of gradient descents. The samples are used to train neural networks that imitate the mapping of the Fenchel conjugate. The training network is incorporated into the Dual space Preconditioned Gradient Descent (DPGD). Some numerical experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method comparing to the standard gradient descent method. The authors proposed an interesting approach to the preconditioning in optimization problems. However, the paper is not well-written. In particular, the optimization algorithm is not clearly described. Numerical experiments with some toy problems are not very convincing to show the benefit of the proposed method.

Q : The techniques used to learn the preconditioner are heuristic , not scalable and without justification or ablation studies . A : The specific algorithm we build upon ( DPGD , Maddison et.al 2019 ) is currently difficult to use practice : there is no theoretical or heuristical way of selecting a pre-conditioner for this algorithm . We propose the first existing method to chose such a pre-conditioner automatically .

Adam and Adagrad are known to be efficient with stochastic objectives ( some convergence results even require stochasticity , cf arxiv : 1810.02263 ) which is not the setting of DPGD . Newton and natural gradient require matrix inversion at each step and are therefore even less scalable , but they would indeed have made good benchmarks . Q : Section 2 : Please explain why Legendre functions are useful in ML . What constraints do you need on f ? What functions satisfy these ? A : Our objective is to efficiently solve convex optimization problems . This might seem restricted in the field of machine learning but has numerous applications . Legendre is a large class of convex functions . The Legendre assumption is one of the assumptions needed to ensure convergence of the dual-space preconditioning algorithm . It is the assumption made by Maddison et . al , 2019.We needed to make this assumption to be able to restate their results .

A : We do not have theoretical results , but this may be difficult to obtain in the context of deep learning . Q : Is it even possible to scale up this method to high dimensions ?

In other cases , our algorithm does scale . Q : Constructing $ \\mu $ requires computing the determinant of the Jacobian . What is the computational complexity ?

Note that we are doing deterministic optimization and therefore suppose we have access to exact gradients for every x in the dataset . Q : It is unclear that the cost of an inverse Hessian matrix is more than the procedure proposed in this paper . A : Supposing we have free access to the Hessian , matrix inversion is more expensive than matrix multiplication .

Q : Please explain what is the advantage of this learned optimizer compared to other methods ? Note that there is literature on non-smooth optimization and methods like sub-gradient descent can be used in this case . A : The subgradient algorithm typically requires the sublinearity of subgradients . Subgradient can not be applied in the setting we consider , for example , it would not converge for a power function objective like $ f ( x ) = x^ { 50 } $ . In such a case , because f is differentiable , a subgradient step is simply a gradient descent step , which does not converge in this case . Q : What is the justification for the selection of the loss function and log-rescaling ? A : The MSE loss function is standard for regression . The justification for the choice of log-rescaling is in Appendix D. In summary , log-rescaling seems empirically adapted to rescale the power function dataset as it reduces the scale of large gradients but not of gradients close to zero .
