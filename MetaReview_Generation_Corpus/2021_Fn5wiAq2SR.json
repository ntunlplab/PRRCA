On the negative side the paper seems to be written in a hurry. At several places terms are not defined, not explained or important details (e.g. parameters of the attack algorithms) are missing. \n\nThus the paper is not ready for publication yet and below the bar for ICLR but I encourage the authors to submit a significantly revised version to another conference.\n\nDetails:\n- in (7) N(x) is nowhere explained or defined, here also several threat models are introduced but later on only l_infty seems\nto be used e.g in Algorithm 1 (should be clarified)\n- as noted in the reviews the definition in (13) is based on quantities nowhere introduced\n- the potential U is only defined in the Algorithm (but then the arguments do not match with the RHS)\n- the kinetic energy in the algorithm is different from what has been used before\n- the parameters for the attacks used are not reported\n- why is AutoAttack not used for all datasets? They report 28% robust accuracy for the model trained by the Madry group\n (https://github.com/MadryLab/robustness) whereas in the present paper it is 35%.\n- the scales of the plots should be chosen such that the curves can be distinguished", "reviews": [{"review_id": "Fn5wiAq2SR-0", "review_text": "Adversarial examples are time-consuming to generate .

Due to the word limits , here we just give some major reasons . First , ATCD is an anytime algorithm expected to find better and better solutions the longer it keeps running . Since samples from the proposal distribution are not accepted automatically as posterior samples , which is essentially different from PGD with random starts . Our ATCD reach our final judgments on the acceptance probability to stay in ( and return large numbers of samples from ) high-density regions of the candidate distribution , while only occasionally visiting low-density regions .

Second , the selection of potential energy and kinetic energy function has a great influence on HMC to simulate the trajectories of adversarial examples , like $ \\theta $ and $ v $ should be not highly dependent . One potential solution is to reduce the relevance between $ v_t $ and the current position $ \\theta_ { t-1 } $ . That makes the sequence of samples into an approximate Markov chain .

But in this paper we mainly focus on improving the efficiency of adversarial training , so we recommend the short-run trajectory increases in speed and maintains the suitable clean accuracy to be a worthwhile trade-off .

The proposed algorithm ATCD views the generation of adversarial examples as a sampling procedure . Specifically , it can be seen as performing HMC sampling .
