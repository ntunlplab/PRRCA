The binary weights are represented using 0s and 1s whereas the effective connections are encoded using the run-length encoder for efficient implementations of neural networks on IoT devices . To quantize the value of weights , a non-negative function is introduced , penalizing values far from two discrete values of 0 and 1 . The performance of the obtained sparse binary neural network is measured on MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets when using fully-connected and convolutional neural networks . It was shown that sparsity degree of 98 % can be achieved at the cost of an accuracy degradation . Strength : -- The paper is easy to read -- The compression rate is very high -- Comprehensive simulations for different hyper-parameters Weakness : -- Misleading notations -- Simulation results are obtained from small datasets -- Significant overlaps with previous works ( limited novelty ) Detailed comments : -- Section 2 under the label \u201c Sparsity \u201d : It is not clear what the authors mean by using { 0 , 1 } for weights instead of { -1 , +1 } . In conventional methods such as binaryconnet , the value of weights is mapped to two discrete values of -1 and +1 where these discrete values can be represented using a single bit ( i.e. , 0 for representing -1 and 1 for representing +1 ) for hardware implementation .

If this is the case , what is the intuition behind using the function f2 ( w ) to push values towards -1 ? On the other hand , if 0 is in fact representing a zero-valued weight , then we have a neural networks with positive weights . Please elaborate . -- Section 3.2 : In the definition of Q , we have mapping from [ 0 , 1 ] to { 0 , 1 } . However , if you use a = -1 and b = +1 in Eq .

The strategy that the authors adopt is to modify binary neural networks like those in the mentioned references of Courbariaux et al.by encoding weights as 0/1 , instead of -1/1 .

Among the three suggested citations , this one is the only one to get compressions of around x35 to x49 times , while limited speed-up in CPU when implemented the compressed model . Moreover , this compression can still be insufficient in very cheap sensors . Regarding the other two suggestions ( CVPR 2018 and 2020 ) , these two works perform quantization a posteriori and not during the training phase , as we do . We will add the two references as examples of such category in the new version we are currently preparing . However , we would like to remark that the CVPR2018 reference has only with a precise model a compression of x51 times , while with other models it compresses no more than x10 to x15 times , which is clearly worse than our results . The CVPR2020 reference mentions a compression aware scheme , but no results about the final compression rate . - Regarding poor writing We are in the process of preparing a new version , where we are willing and totally open to restructure the content in the different parts . We would therefore be grateful if more details could be provided . While some other reviewers consider the writing a strength of this work , the provided feedback of this review is not specific on what is considered as poor so , it is difficult for us to establish what is not clear . - Regarding weak experiments We do not focus on CNNs compression . We would like to highlight again that some of the works which have been mentioned in this review are less powerful than the proposed scheme . We have not used a LeNet on MNIST , but a fully connected multi-layer perceptron topology , the same used in [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] and [ 4 ] and used to see the effect of the quantization on fully connected topologies . The shallow VGG-like network is similar to the one used in [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] and [ 3 ] . Therefore , we consider that our experimental setup matches that one of state-of-the-art works . - Regarding accuracy loss We are aware of the loss and , we are also aware that in general binary neural networks have difficulties with convolutional neural networks . As explained in [ 5 ] it is still unclear what kind of network structure is suitable for binarization , so that the information passing through the network can be preserved , even after binarization . Our goal is to further enhance the compression capabilities of binary neural networks , which exhibit interesting speed-up properties when run on CPU and low energy consumption , making them very good candidates for very cheap IoT sensors with limited resource battery ( E.g. , very cheap wireless sensors used to read the digits of sensor meters not connected to the network ) .

We will add the two references as examples of such category in the new version we are currently preparing . However , we would like to remark that the CVPR2018 reference has only with a precise model a compression of x51 times , while with other models it compresses no more than x10 to x15 times , which is clearly worse than our results . The CVPR2020 reference mentions a compression aware scheme , but no results about the final compression rate . - Regarding poor writing We are in the process of preparing a new version , where we are willing and totally open to restructure the content in the different parts . We would therefore be grateful if more details could be provided . While some other reviewers consider the writing a strength of this work , the provided feedback of this review is not specific on what is considered as poor so , it is difficult for us to establish what is not clear . - Regarding weak experiments We do not focus on CNNs compression . We would like to highlight again that some of the works which have been mentioned in this review are less powerful than the proposed scheme . We have not used a LeNet on MNIST , but a fully connected multi-layer perceptron topology , the same used in [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] and [ 4 ] and used to see the effect of the quantization on fully connected topologies . The shallow VGG-like network is similar to the one used in [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] and [ 3 ] . Therefore , we consider that our experimental setup matches that one of state-of-the-art works . - Regarding accuracy loss We are aware of the loss and , we are also aware that in general binary neural networks have difficulties with convolutional neural networks . As explained in [ 5 ] it is still unclear what kind of network structure is suitable for binarization , so that the information passing through the network can be preserved , even after binarization . Our goal is to further enhance the compression capabilities of binary neural networks , which exhibit interesting speed-up properties when run on CPU and low energy consumption , making them very good candidates for very cheap IoT sensors with limited resource battery ( E.g. , very cheap wireless sensors used to read the digits of sensor meters not connected to the network ) .
