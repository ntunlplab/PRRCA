This can be learnt from a multimodal corpus by observing that the occurrence of the word \u201c I \u201d is not correlated with the emotion of the utterance ( i.e. , occurence of \u201c I \u201d is throughout the acoustic space instead of clustered with only the sad utterances ) . 2.Regarding the readability of the paper , we can certainly improve the overall layout of the paper and will be uploading it in the revised submission .

While all of these latent factors influence the observed acoustic features , they are both local as well as global in nature . Local factors of variation are transient , for example , phonetics ( fricative , vowel sounds , etc . ) and pause fillers . Global factors of variation influence the whole utterance , for example higher or lower average pitch ( which can vary with gender , i.e. , a global attribute ) .

To do so , the authors first consider that the shared latent space z results from a weighted combination of the outputs of M encoders corresponding to M different modalities . This appears to be a convex combination ( Eq.1 ) , although it is not mentioned that each weight should be positive explicitly ( authors can clarify this in an updated version ) . The shared space is also regularized with a squared l2 norm . The authors subsequently force z to be close to the encodings of each modality ( u ( x ) _j ) while also reconstructing each observation from the same modality . The authors introduce two more loss functions as a way to learn importance weights for samples/modalities ( _ { ij } ) . This is done by a cross-correlation loss that learns high importance when there is high correlation between modality/sample encodings and the shared latent space . This is also influenced by a hyperparameter indicating prior knowledge on data quality per modality . The experimental results demonstrate that the importance mechanism improves results , at least for the specific datasets and experimental setting . Some comments follow below : - > generalization and robustness : As an importance is assigned to each sample per modality , what happens when outliers are present in the data ? Could this mechanism essentially overfit such noise ( perhaps common in all modalities ) due to the individual sample weighting , and lead to a lack of generalization on an unseen dataset ? Robust methods ( e.g. , depending on l1 regularization ) might be able to cope with such scenarios better - > missing modalities : the authors highlight that the method can handle missing modalities - by setting the importance weight for the corresponding modality to zero . However there is not enough experimental evidance ( unless I have missed something ) in the main paper to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method in this respect . Also , models that impose a shared-space assumption ( in the most simple way , shared-siamese style encoders leading to common layers ) can also handle missing modalities in the same manner - so I would n't say that this is the strongest contribution of this paper . - > The cross-covariance loss function ( and in general , soft orth constraints ) have been used in the context of private-shared space models ( e.g. , stemming from the classical Inter-Battery Factor Analysis ) . In many ways , it would be interesting to review and link this literature with work dealing with discovering shared-representations ( e.g. , Deep CCA , Andrew ICML 2013 ) , as this work could potentially be considered an extension of these methods . - > attention mechanisms are not mentioned in the paper , however Eq.1 is reminiscent of an attention mechanism . Could we consider this approach as a form of attention-autoencoder , where the attention weight is used to indicate importance ? - > was the prior hyperparameter that controls the number of corrupted samples tuned in some automatic way ? ( e.g. , grid-search ) . Of course the features are extracted in an unsupervised manner , however ( i ) the samples are corrupted by artificial rather than real noise in the experiments and this is known during the experiment , and ( ii ) in unknown test-sets , the noise distribution might vary and could be unknown . For a particular choice of hyper-parameter values , the authors state that this `` indicates that these would be the optimal values for best performance in image and speech modalities respectively '' - but can we really be confident that these values will be consistently better ? Could this just be fitting the particular dataset properties and harming generalization ? - > optimization : why is the particular approach employed with alternating optimization ? It is difficult to claim convergence for the given setting , but have the authors observed good convergence properties in the model ? What values were given to hyperparameters \\lambda for each experiment ? Also , it appears that there are several constraints on z - some countering each other in some way . - > continuing from the previous point , for example z has to be equal to each u ( x ) _j , but also equal to a convex combination of all u ( x ) _js , while an additional cross-covariance loss is imposed so that z correlates with u ( x ) _j . At the same time , u ( x ) _j must reconstruct each x_j - which essentially means to my understanding that in an optimal setting , the decoder should contract or absorb all information that is not 'shared ' amongst the modalities ( what the authors call uncorrelated noise ) . Does this cause additional instability during training ? Could it be that information inherent only to one modality is still useful , and not uncorrelated noise - which however would be disregarded within this approach ?", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We thank Reviewer 3 for the constructive comments and would like to present the following points as replies . One point we wish to make here is the definition of noise in the context of our paper . For our experiments , noise is uncorrelated , i.e. , the corrupted region in each modality that has the property of not being well-correlated with the other modalities . The detection of noise here is not through outlier detection ( as in anomaly detection ) , but is learnt from the pattern of correlation with other modalities by the importance network . 1.We have not experimented with robustness to outliers , however if the outlier noise in a modality is not correlated with the other modalities ( and thus would have low correlation with multimodal z ) , then it would be expected to be uncorrelated noise , and detected and filtered out by the importance network . Regarding each sample being provided an importance weight , this is constrained by a decision boundary learnt by the importance network . As long as the network is not over-parameterized and is tuned to learn well-formed boundaries , it should be able to learn proper importances without overfitting . 2.We agree with the reviewer that the shared-space assumption is also being utilized in this paper to enable robust inference in absence of modalities ( similar to the example provided by the author ) . We will be augmenting Table 2 to report additional performance metrics when only one modality is provided ( either image/speech digits ) . In the emotion retrieval experiments in Table 1 , the \u201c Verbal \u201d and \u201c Acoustic \u201d columns already report performances when only one modality is provided . We are also not claiming missing modality robustness as the main contribution here but rather : ( 1 ) scalability through fewer loss terms to optimize during training compared to JMVAE-KL and MVAE and ( 2 ) the detection of important regions in each modality . 3.In our Related Works section , we shall certainly link our proposed IMA model as extensions of the previous work the reviewer has mentioned ( IBFA as well as Deep CCA ) . 4.We are drawing a distinction between attention mechanisms and the concept of importance here in this paper . This is mainly due to two reasons . Firstly , the classical attention mechanisms in seq2seq or image-text applications focus on learnable attention weights within the input sequence during decoding . This is intra-modality , in contrast to importance weights with which we weigh different modalities in IMA . Secondly , importance is mostly based on learning which regions in each modality are correlated with other modalities , in contrast to standard attention mechanisms which are based on learning regions of an input sequence to which a decoder can focus on when considering a specific token within the output sequence . 5.There was no specific automatic method to tune the importance prior , considering that the ground truth digit/emotion labels are not available during training of the autoencoder or importance networks . However , during evaluation we do compare the performance against these labels to obtain an insight into the performance at detecting uncorrelated noise . In Fig A3 ( appendix ) , the high F1 score obtained during these comparison experiments do indicate our confidence that at a certain value of importance prior , we do successfully identify the important regions in each modality . We will be revising our claim in the paper that \u201c .. indicates this would be the optimal values ... \u201d In the experiments on the MNIST-TIDIGITS dataset , the uncorrelated noise was artificially synthesized , however for the emotion understanding experiments on IEMOCAP , we have not synthesized any corruption . The dataset naturally has uncorrelated noise , for example function words in the verbal modality are not correlated with the utterance emotion and can be detected by our proposed model . 6.The multimodal autoencoder and importance networks do not have compatible objectives . Minimizing the cross-correlation loss would identify the important regions of each modality but using them as weights in the multimodal autoencoder would not necessarily minimize reconstruction loss . Learning the importance weights directly from the multimodal autoencoder alone by minimizing reconstruction loss would still weigh the low-importance regions for the sake of modality reconstruction , but not minimize the cross-correlation loss . We are effectively searching for the equilibrium of these objectives , which is more suitable with an alternating minimization stage . Experimentally as well , we have found it practically inconvenient to optimize all the autoencoder and importance losses together and ensure they all minimize and converge . Doing a two-stage alternating minimization process mitigates this issue . The hyperparameters $ \\lambda $ have been set to 1.0 for the multimodal autoencoder in all experiments , and we have found this to be satisfactory in reducing the loss terms controlling z ."}, {"review_id": "4jXnFYaDOuD-3", "review_text": "This paper presents a multimodal Autoencoder framework that learns the multimodal latent representations alongwith the importance of regions in each modality \u2019 s representation space in an unsupervised fashion .

This paper presents an elegant importance based model and architecture that takes into account various local and joint loss functions along with alignment factors to represent the Autoencoder model . Some questions/comments that would make the paper more readable : - Architecture diagram : Please provide an architecture diagram for the model to help the readers - How good are the embeddings for downstream applications : Can we use these representations and compare performance with other learnt embedding models ? How would the performance be with missing modalities ? - Table 1 - It is surprising to see that weighted Precision is less than unweighted Precision - any thoughts ? - Comparison to other Autoencoders : How does this compare to denoising Autoencoder ?

How fast is the model training compared to other similar models ?", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We thank Reviewer 2 for his/her constructive comments . Our replies to the reviewer comments are provided below : 1 . As also requested by the other reviewers we will certainly update the revised submission with an overall architecture diagram . 2.Due to page limit we did not mention expansive experiments on evaluating quality of these embeddings for downstream tasks in the main paper , however we have presented results utilizing the learnt embedding for multimodal digit and emotion recognition experiments in Appendix A4 . The IMA model is compared to the MVAE and JMVAE-KL models and the performance of IMA is competitive with these baselines . We also include performances in the case of missing modalities . 3.The multimodal embeddings/importances are learnt by IMA without access to the emotion labels during training , and thus it is possible that in Table 1 , the importance network for the speech modality has inferred certain frames in the acoustic modality as uncorrelated noise and thus not important , whereas given the emotion labels they might be relevant . For those samples , it is possible that an unweighted representation ( where all frames are considered - simple average ) might be providing better precision performance than weighted representations ( where the frame representations are weighted by importance ) when the emotion label is considered as a ground truth during evaluation . We feel this is more due to mismatch between training and evaluation objectives , and that the lower precision for the acoustic modality is also influencing the multimodal performance . 4.Time permitting , we will be comparing IMA and mentioning the results to some of the models suggested by the reviewer ( ie.denoising autoencoder / Wasserstein autoencoder ) . Could the reviewer provide a link to the citation for the multimodal factorization model ? Regarding Fig 2 , the word-level importances are based on correlations between words and the acoustic frames they co-occur with , which is different from self-attention weights which are based only within the words themselves . Further self-attention carries a semantic meaning , compared to IMA importance-weights at word level , which we have found relates to emotion . 5.In comparison to the MVAE model , we have ensured that the encoder and decoder sizes are the same as those for IMA to obtain a comparable experimental setting for benchmarking . We will be inserting a section in the Appendix on model complexity comparison between IMA and baseline models . For the MNIST-TIDIGITS experiments ( 50D ) , MVAE has a total of 783000 parameters for the encoder and 1217360 parameters for the decoder , amounting to ~2 million parameters . In comparison , IMA has 753000 parameters for the encoder and 754280 parameters for the decoder , adding to ~1.5 million parameters . The importance network has 723402 additional parameters . We have found model training time for IMA to be faster than both JMVAE-KL and MVAE due to it having a simpler architecture than the baselines ( fewer loss terms to optimize and there is no probabilistic assumption , and thus no covariance calculation unlike VAE ) . The importance networks do incur overhead , however they can be parallelized across modalities . We have also experimented with weight-sharing between encoders and the importance network , however do not obtain good convergence ."}], "0": {"review_id": "4jXnFYaDOuD-0", "review_text": "The paper proposes the IMA model , a scalable model that learns modality importances and robust multimodal representations through a novel cross-covariance based loss function .

To do so , the authors first consider that the shared latent space z results from a weighted combination of the outputs of M encoders corresponding to M different modalities . This appears to be a convex combination ( Eq.1 ) , although it is not mentioned that each weight should be positive explicitly ( authors can clarify this in an updated version ) . The shared space is also regularized with a squared l2 norm . The authors subsequently force z to be close to the encodings of each modality ( u ( x ) _j ) while also reconstructing each observation from the same modality . The authors introduce two more loss functions as a way to learn importance weights for samples/modalities ( _ { ij } ) . This is done by a cross-correlation loss that learns high importance when there is high correlation between modality/sample encodings and the shared latent space . This is also influenced by a hyperparameter indicating prior knowledge on data quality per modality . The experimental results demonstrate that the importance mechanism improves results , at least for the specific datasets and experimental setting . Some comments follow below : - > generalization and robustness : As an importance is assigned to each sample per modality , what happens when outliers are present in the data ? Could this mechanism essentially overfit such noise ( perhaps common in all modalities ) due to the individual sample weighting , and lead to a lack of generalization on an unseen dataset ? Robust methods ( e.g. , depending on l1 regularization ) might be able to cope with such scenarios better - > missing modalities : the authors highlight that the method can handle missing modalities - by setting the importance weight for the corresponding modality to zero . However there is not enough experimental evidance ( unless I have missed something ) in the main paper to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method in this respect . Also , models that impose a shared-space assumption ( in the most simple way , shared-siamese style encoders leading to common layers ) can also handle missing modalities in the same manner - so I would n't say that this is the strongest contribution of this paper . - > The cross-covariance loss function ( and in general , soft orth constraints ) have been used in the context of private-shared space models ( e.g. , stemming from the classical Inter-Battery Factor Analysis ) . In many ways , it would be interesting to review and link this literature with work dealing with discovering shared-representations ( e.g. , Deep CCA , Andrew ICML 2013 ) , as this work could potentially be considered an extension of these methods . - > attention mechanisms are not mentioned in the paper , however Eq.1 is reminiscent of an attention mechanism . Could we consider this approach as a form of attention-autoencoder , where the attention weight is used to indicate importance ? - > was the prior hyperparameter that controls the number of corrupted samples tuned in some automatic way ? ( e.g. , grid-search ) . Of course the features are extracted in an unsupervised manner , however ( i ) the samples are corrupted by artificial rather than real noise in the experiments and this is known during the experiment , and ( ii ) in unknown test-sets , the noise distribution might vary and could be unknown . For a particular choice of hyper-parameter values , the authors state that this `` indicates that these would be the optimal values for best performance in image and speech modalities respectively '' - but can we really be confident that these values will be consistently better ? Could this just be fitting the particular dataset properties and harming generalization ? - > optimization : why is the particular approach employed with alternating optimization ? It is difficult to claim convergence for the given setting , but have the authors observed good convergence properties in the model ? What values were given to hyperparameters \\lambda for each experiment ? Also , it appears that there are several constraints on z - some countering each other in some way . - > continuing from the previous point , for example z has to be equal to each u ( x ) _j , but also equal to a convex combination of all u ( x ) _js , while an additional cross-covariance loss is imposed so that z correlates with u ( x ) _j . At the same time , u ( x ) _j must reconstruct each x_j - which essentially means to my understanding that in an optimal setting , the decoder should contract or absorb all information that is not 'shared ' amongst the modalities ( what the authors call uncorrelated noise ) . Does this cause additional instability during training ? Could it be that information inherent only to one modality is still useful , and not uncorrelated noise - which however would be disregarded within this approach ?", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We thank Reviewer 3 for the constructive comments and would like to present the following points as replies . One point we wish to make here is the definition of noise in the context of our paper . For our experiments , noise is uncorrelated , i.e. , the corrupted region in each modality that has the property of not being well-correlated with the other modalities . The detection of noise here is not through outlier detection ( as in anomaly detection ) , but is learnt from the pattern of correlation with other modalities by the importance network . 1.We have not experimented with robustness to outliers , however if the outlier noise in a modality is not correlated with the other modalities ( and thus would have low correlation with multimodal z ) , then it would be expected to be uncorrelated noise , and detected and filtered out by the importance network . Regarding each sample being provided an importance weight , this is constrained by a decision boundary learnt by the importance network . As long as the network is not over-parameterized and is tuned to learn well-formed boundaries , it should be able to learn proper importances without overfitting . 2.We agree with the reviewer that the shared-space assumption is also being utilized in this paper to enable robust inference in absence of modalities ( similar to the example provided by the author ) . We will be augmenting Table 2 to report additional performance metrics when only one modality is provided ( either image/speech digits ) . In the emotion retrieval experiments in Table 1 , the \u201c Verbal \u201d and \u201c Acoustic \u201d columns already report performances when only one modality is provided . We are also not claiming missing modality robustness as the main contribution here but rather : ( 1 ) scalability through fewer loss terms to optimize during training compared to JMVAE-KL and MVAE and ( 2 ) the detection of important regions in each modality . 3.In our Related Works section , we shall certainly link our proposed IMA model as extensions of the previous work the reviewer has mentioned ( IBFA as well as Deep CCA ) . 4.We are drawing a distinction between attention mechanisms and the concept of importance here in this paper . This is mainly due to two reasons . Firstly , the classical attention mechanisms in seq2seq or image-text applications focus on learnable attention weights within the input sequence during decoding . This is intra-modality , in contrast to importance weights with which we weigh different modalities in IMA . Secondly , importance is mostly based on learning which regions in each modality are correlated with other modalities , in contrast to standard attention mechanisms which are based on learning regions of an input sequence to which a decoder can focus on when considering a specific token within the output sequence . 5.There was no specific automatic method to tune the importance prior , considering that the ground truth digit/emotion labels are not available during training of the autoencoder or importance networks . However , during evaluation we do compare the performance against these labels to obtain an insight into the performance at detecting uncorrelated noise . In Fig A3 ( appendix ) , the high F1 score obtained during these comparison experiments do indicate our confidence that at a certain value of importance prior , we do successfully identify the important regions in each modality . We will be revising our claim in the paper that \u201c .. indicates this would be the optimal values ... \u201d In the experiments on the MNIST-TIDIGITS dataset , the uncorrelated noise was artificially synthesized , however for the emotion understanding experiments on IEMOCAP , we have not synthesized any corruption . The dataset naturally has uncorrelated noise , for example function words in the verbal modality are not correlated with the utterance emotion and can be detected by our proposed model . 6.The multimodal autoencoder and importance networks do not have compatible objectives . Minimizing the cross-correlation loss would identify the important regions of each modality but using them as weights in the multimodal autoencoder would not necessarily minimize reconstruction loss . Learning the importance weights directly from the multimodal autoencoder alone by minimizing reconstruction loss would still weigh the low-importance regions for the sake of modality reconstruction , but not minimize the cross-correlation loss . We are effectively searching for the equilibrium of these objectives , which is more suitable with an alternating minimization stage . Experimentally as well , we have found it practically inconvenient to optimize all the autoencoder and importance losses together and ensure they all minimize and converge . Doing a two-stage alternating minimization process mitigates this issue . The hyperparameters $ \\lambda $ have been set to 1.0 for the multimodal autoencoder in all experiments , and we have found this to be satisfactory in reducing the loss terms controlling z ."}, "3": {"review_id": "4jXnFYaDOuD-3", "review_text": "This paper presents a multimodal Autoencoder framework that learns the multimodal latent representations alongwith the importance of regions in each modality \u2019 s representation space in an unsupervised fashion . Multimodal fusion algorithms either use complex architecture representations or use disentangling joint representations for improving generative auto-encoding architectures using VAEs , GANs , WAE and some variants of these . This paper presents an elegant importance based model and architecture that takes into account various local and joint loss functions along with alignment factors to represent the Autoencoder model . Some questions/comments that would make the paper more readable : - Architecture diagram : Please provide an architecture diagram for the model to help the readers - How good are the embeddings for downstream applications : Can we use these representations and compare performance with other learnt embedding models ? How would the performance be with missing modalities ? - Table 1 - It is surprising to see that weighted Precision is less than unweighted Precision - any thoughts ? - Comparison to other Autoencoders : How does this compare to denoising Autoencoder ? How does this compare to Wasserstein autoencoders and the variants such as the multimodal factorization model neural architecture ? Figure 2 : Any relationship or companion to self-attention weights and word level importances - Number of network params compared to MVAE model that the authors have compared to ? How fast is the model training compared to other similar models ?", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We thank Reviewer 2 for his/her constructive comments . Our replies to the reviewer comments are provided below : 1 . As also requested by the other reviewers we will certainly update the revised submission with an overall architecture diagram . 2.Due to page limit we did not mention expansive experiments on evaluating quality of these embeddings for downstream tasks in the main paper , however we have presented results utilizing the learnt embedding for multimodal digit and emotion recognition experiments in Appendix A4 . The IMA model is compared to the MVAE and JMVAE-KL models and the performance of IMA is competitive with these baselines . We also include performances in the case of missing modalities . 3.The multimodal embeddings/importances are learnt by IMA without access to the emotion labels during training , and thus it is possible that in Table 1 , the importance network for the speech modality has inferred certain frames in the acoustic modality as uncorrelated noise and thus not important , whereas given the emotion labels they might be relevant . For those samples , it is possible that an unweighted representation ( where all frames are considered - simple average ) might be providing better precision performance than weighted representations ( where the frame representations are weighted by importance ) when the emotion label is considered as a ground truth during evaluation . We feel this is more due to mismatch between training and evaluation objectives , and that the lower precision for the acoustic modality is also influencing the multimodal performance . 4.Time permitting , we will be comparing IMA and mentioning the results to some of the models suggested by the reviewer ( ie.denoising autoencoder / Wasserstein autoencoder ) . Could the reviewer provide a link to the citation for the multimodal factorization model ? Regarding Fig 2 , the word-level importances are based on correlations between words and the acoustic frames they co-occur with , which is different from self-attention weights which are based only within the words themselves . Further self-attention carries a semantic meaning , compared to IMA importance-weights at word level , which we have found relates to emotion . 5.In comparison to the MVAE model , we have ensured that the encoder and decoder sizes are the same as those for IMA to obtain a comparable experimental setting for benchmarking . We will be inserting a section in the Appendix on model complexity comparison between IMA and baseline models . For the MNIST-TIDIGITS experiments ( 50D ) , MVAE has a total of 783000 parameters for the encoder and 1217360 parameters for the decoder , amounting to ~2 million parameters . In comparison , IMA has 753000 parameters for the encoder and 754280 parameters for the decoder , adding to ~1.5 million parameters . The importance network has 723402 additional parameters . We have found model training time for IMA to be faster than both JMVAE-KL and MVAE due to it having a simpler architecture than the baselines ( fewer loss terms to optimize and there is no probabilistic assumption , and thus no covariance calculation unlike VAE ) . The importance networks do incur overhead , however they can be parallelized across modalities . We have also experimented with weight-sharing between encoders and the importance network , however do not obtain good convergence ."}}
