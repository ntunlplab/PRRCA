In this setting , authors derived convergence rates $ O\\left ( \\frac { 1 } { \\varepsilon } \\right ) $ and $ O\\left ( \\log\\left ( \\frac { 1 } { \\varepsilon } \\right ) \\right ) $ for Stochastic Subgradient Descent ( SSGD ) for convex and strongly convex objectives respectively . Up to the difference in factors hidden in $ O ( \\cdot ) $ , these rates match the rate of SGD in the convex and strongly convex cases under interpolation assumption , which partially explains why neural networks with non-smooth activations can usually be trained as fast as ones with smooth activations . Moreover , the authors derived lower complexity bounds for this particular class of problems showing that SSGD is optimal in the convex case under interpolation . Overall , the contributions are quite impressive and solid , the paper is clearly written , and the proofs are simple and short ( which is actually one of the biggest advantages of this paper ) . However , there are also some technical issues in the proofs of lower bounds . Fortunately , these issues can be easily fixed ( see the Weaknesses part for further details ) . # # Strengths 1 . * * Clarity , motivation , and related work . * * The paper is reader-friendly : the results are presented clearly and explained well , the problem is well-motivated , the literature review is very concrete and covers the most relevant papers , to the best of my knowledge . 2 . * * Lower bounds and tight rates for SSGD . * * Authors proposed lower bounds showing that $ O ( 1/\\varepsilon ) $ is the best convergence rate one can hope for in this setting . These lower bounds are tighter than standard lower bounds for non-smooth convex optimization , and they rely on a particular structure of function $ f $ . Moreover , the authors show that SSGD complexity bounds match the proposed lower bounds . 3 . * * Simple proofs . * * I have checked all proofs : they are mathematically correct * * ( except the proofs of lower bounds ; see the weaknesses part ) * * , clearly written , and short . Taking into account the novelty and importance of the proposed results , simple and solid proofs are a nice bonus making the paper easy to read . # # Weaknesses 1 . * * Experiments . * * There are almost no experiments in the paper . While the contribution of the paper is primarily theoretical , I believe the paper would benefit from adding some numerical study justifying the proposed theory on different problems . 2 . * * Inaccuracies in the proofs of lower bounds . * * Formally speaking , the proof of Theorem 4.6 is incorrect . Indeed , if $ w^ { ( 0 ) } = 0 $ , then $ w^ { ( 1 ) } \\not\\in \\text { span } ( e_1 , \\ldots , e_t ) $ , but $ w^ { ( 1 ) } \\in \\text { span } ( e_1 , \\ldots , e_t , { \\color { red } e_ { t+1 } } ) $ , because the subgradient of $ \\partial f ( w^ { ( 0 ) } ) = \\frac { 2L^2R^2 } { t+1 } \\cdot\\text { conv } ( e_1 , \\ldots , e_t , { \\color { red } e_ { t+1 } } ) $ . Since the proof of Theorem 4.7 relies on the following technique , it is mathematically incorrect too . However , it can be easily fixed without changing the main idea ; see my version of the proof below . - * * Proof of Theorem 4.6 . * * Let us consider the same function $ f $ , the same starting point $ w^ { ( 0 ) } = 0 $ , but change the definition of $ w^ { \\star } $ in the following way : $ w^ { \\star } =\\left [ \\frac { R } { \\sqrt { t+1 } } + \\varepsilon , \\frac { R } { \\sqrt { t+1 } } + \\frac { \\varepsilon } { 2 } , \\ldots , \\frac { R } { \\sqrt { t+1 } } + \\frac { \\varepsilon } { 2^t } , 0 , \\ldots , 0\\right ] ^\\top $ , where $ \\varepsilon > 0 $ is some small number . We have $ \\partial f ( w ) = 2L^2||w - w^ { \\star } ||_ { \\infty } \\cdot \\text { conv } ( \\partial ( |w_i - { w_i } ^ { \\star } | ) \\quad|\\quad i : \\quad i\\in I ( w ) ) $ , where $ i\\in I ( w ) $ means that $ |w_i- { w_i } ^ { \\star } | $ equals $ \\ell_\\infty $ -norm of $ w-w^ * $ . Therefore , one can easily check via induction that $ w^ { ( s ) } $ lies in the span of first $ s $ coordinate vectors for all $ s \\leq t $ since coordinates $ w_i^ * $ of $ w^ * $ are decreasing when $ i $ increases ( see also the formula for $ \\partial f ( w ) $ ) . Using this we derive $ f ( w^ { ( s ) } ) - f ( w^ * ) \\geq \\left ( \\frac { LR } { \\sqrt { t+1 } } + \\frac { L\\varepsilon } { 2^s } \\right ) ^2 $ for all $ s \\leq t $ . Taking the limit w.r.t. $ \\varepsilon \\downarrow 0 $ we get the result . # # Questions and Comments 1. page 1 , Abstract , `` By leveraging ... '' : The sentence is incomplete and should be rewritten . 2. page 4 , `` $ f $ is differentiable ... '' : I guess , this sentence is slightly misleading : $ f ( w ) = 0 $ means that $ w $ is a minimizer and interpolation condition is satisfied , while in general if $ w $ is a minimizer , then it is not necessary that $ f ( w ) = 0 $ ( unless we have an interpolation ) . Consider rewriting of the sentence . 3. page 11 , inequality between ( A.1 ) and ( A.2 ) : $ \\sqrt { 2\\left ( l ( h_i ( w_2 ) - l ( 0 ) \\right ) } $ $ \\to $ $ \\sqrt { 2\\left ( l ( h_i ( w_2 ) { \\color { red } ) } - l ( 0 ) \\right ) } $ 4. page 11 , ineq .

'' arXiv preprint arXiv:1907.04232 ( 2019 ) . # # Final Remarks To conclude , the paper makes an important contribution to the theory of stochastic optimization under interpolation .

In this setting , authors derived convergence rates $ O\\left ( \\frac { 1 } { \\varepsilon } \\right ) $ and $ O\\left ( \\log\\left ( \\frac { 1 } { \\varepsilon } \\right ) \\right ) $ for Stochastic Subgradient Descent ( SSGD ) for convex and strongly convex objectives respectively . Up to the difference in factors hidden in $ O ( \\cdot ) $ , these rates match the rate of SGD in the convex and strongly convex cases under interpolation assumption , which partially explains why neural networks with non-smooth activations can usually be trained as fast as ones with smooth activations . Moreover , the authors derived lower complexity bounds for this particular class of problems showing that SSGD is optimal in the convex case under interpolation . Overall , the contributions are quite impressive and solid , the paper is clearly written , and the proofs are simple and short ( which is actually one of the biggest advantages of this paper ) . However , there are also some technical issues in the proofs of lower bounds . Fortunately , these issues can be easily fixed ( see the Weaknesses part for further details ) . # # Strengths 1 . * * Clarity , motivation , and related work . * * The paper is reader-friendly : the results are presented clearly and explained well , the problem is well-motivated , the literature review is very concrete and covers the most relevant papers , to the best of my knowledge . 2 . * * Lower bounds and tight rates for SSGD . * * Authors proposed lower bounds showing that $ O ( 1/\\varepsilon ) $ is the best convergence rate one can hope for in this setting . These lower bounds are tighter than standard lower bounds for non-smooth convex optimization , and they rely on a particular structure of function $ f $ . Moreover , the authors show that SSGD complexity bounds match the proposed lower bounds . 3 . * * Simple proofs . * * I have checked all proofs : they are mathematically correct * * ( except the proofs of lower bounds ; see the weaknesses part ) * * , clearly written , and short . Taking into account the novelty and importance of the proposed results , simple and solid proofs are a nice bonus making the paper easy to read . # # Weaknesses 1 . * * Experiments . * * There are almost no experiments in the paper . While the contribution of the paper is primarily theoretical , I believe the paper would benefit from adding some numerical study justifying the proposed theory on different problems . 2 . * * Inaccuracies in the proofs of lower bounds . * * Formally speaking , the proof of Theorem 4.6 is incorrect . Indeed , if $ w^ { ( 0 ) } = 0 $ , then $ w^ { ( 1 ) } \\not\\in \\text { span } ( e_1 , \\ldots , e_t ) $ , but $ w^ { ( 1 ) } \\in \\text { span } ( e_1 , \\ldots , e_t , { \\color { red } e_ { t+1 } } ) $ , because the subgradient of $ \\partial f ( w^ { ( 0 ) } ) = \\frac { 2L^2R^2 } { t+1 } \\cdot\\text { conv } ( e_1 , \\ldots , e_t , { \\color { red } e_ { t+1 } } ) $ . Since the proof of Theorem 4.7 relies on the following technique , it is mathematically incorrect too . However , it can be easily fixed without changing the main idea ; see my version of the proof below . - * * Proof of Theorem 4.6 . * * Let us consider the same function $ f $ , the same starting point $ w^ { ( 0 ) } = 0 $ , but change the definition of $ w^ { \\star } $ in the following way : $ w^ { \\star } =\\left [ \\frac { R } { \\sqrt { t+1 } } + \\varepsilon , \\frac { R } { \\sqrt { t+1 } } + \\frac { \\varepsilon } { 2 } , \\ldots , \\frac { R } { \\sqrt { t+1 } } + \\frac { \\varepsilon } { 2^t } , 0 , \\ldots , 0\\right ] ^\\top $ , where $ \\varepsilon > 0 $ is some small number . We have $ \\partial f ( w ) = 2L^2||w - w^ { \\star } ||_ { \\infty } \\cdot \\text { conv } ( \\partial ( |w_i - { w_i } ^ { \\star } | ) \\quad|\\quad i : \\quad i\\in I ( w ) ) $ , where $ i\\in I ( w ) $ means that $ |w_i- { w_i } ^ { \\star } | $ equals $ \\ell_\\infty $ -norm of $ w-w^ * $ . Therefore , one can easily check via induction that $ w^ { ( s ) } $ lies in the span of first $ s $ coordinate vectors for all $ s \\leq t $ since coordinates $ w_i^ * $ of $ w^ * $ are decreasing when $ i $ increases ( see also the formula for $ \\partial f ( w ) $ ) . Using this we derive $ f ( w^ { ( s ) } ) - f ( w^ * ) \\geq \\left ( \\frac { LR } { \\sqrt { t+1 } } + \\frac { L\\varepsilon } { 2^s } \\right ) ^2 $ for all $ s \\leq t $ . Taking the limit w.r.t. $ \\varepsilon \\downarrow 0 $ we get the result . # # Questions and Comments 1. page 1 , Abstract , `` By leveraging ... '' : The sentence is incomplete and should be rewritten . 2. page 4 , `` $ f $ is differentiable ... '' : I guess , this sentence is slightly misleading : $ f ( w ) = 0 $ means that $ w $ is a minimizer and interpolation condition is satisfied , while in general if $ w $ is a minimizer , then it is not necessary that $ f ( w ) = 0 $ ( unless we have an interpolation ) . Consider rewriting of the sentence . 3. page 11 , inequality between ( A.1 ) and ( A.2 ) : $ \\sqrt { 2\\left ( l ( h_i ( w_2 ) - l ( 0 ) \\right ) } $ $ \\to $ $ \\sqrt { 2\\left ( l ( h_i ( w_2 ) { \\color { red } ) } - l ( 0 ) \\right ) } $ 4. page 11 , ineq .

Anyway , authors should add a formal definition . 6. page 6 , Theorem 4.5 : Actually , one can extend the result using the recurrence ( 4.12 ) for the general choice of $ \\alpha_t $ and applying some standard stepsize schedules for SGD ; e.g. , see - Stich , Sebastian U . `` Unified optimal analysis of the ( stochastic ) gradient method . '' arXiv preprint arXiv:1907.04232 ( 2019 ) . # # Final Remarks To conclude , the paper makes an important contribution to the theory of stochastic optimization under interpolation . There are small issues in the proofs for lower bounds that can be easily fixed ( see my comment in the Weaknesses part ) . I encourage the authors to apply the needed corrections . * * If the authors fix the issues mentioned above , I will increase my score . * *", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "reply_text": "Thanks for your helpful comments . We appreciate that you point out the slight flaw in our proof and provide a fix . Your fix is totally valid and we have updated our manuscript accordingly . Thanks for pointing out some typos and confusing sentences . We have fixed them in our updated manuscript . Thanks for mentioning other choices of stepsize scheduling , I think we can not directly apply Stich 's [ 1 ] technique because our Eq ( 4.12 ) does not satisfy his Eq ( 8 ) . When constant learning rate is used , $ \\frac { 4 } { \\mu } f^ * $ will always appear in Eq ( 4.13 ) ( this term does not depend on the choice of stepsize ) , it seems nontrivial to obtain a rate similar to the one in [ Theorem 5 , 1 ] .

It has proven that SSGD converges with rate O ( 1/epsilon ) for convex problem and O ( log ( 1/\\epsilon ) ) for strongly-convex problems . What is more , it is proven that O ( 1/\\epsilon ) is optimal for the subgradient method in convex and interpolation setting . Overall , I vote for accepting . The rate and lower bound results are solid theoretic results . It helps to explain the empirical observation that nonsmooth machine learning models are not necessarily more difficult to optimize than smooth models in practice . Pros : 1.The results can be helpful to explain some observations in practice . 2.This would be a helpful result to investigate interpolation models , which has attracted attention recently . Cons : 1.This paper only considers convex and strongly-convex problems , while over-parameterized models are usually nonconvex model , e.g. , DNN . 2.The authors did not give empirical results to verify that ( S ) SGD do have similar performance in smooth and nonsmooth problems . 3.I have a minor concern regarding the reason of nonsmoothness . It seems that the authors blame the nonsmoothness in neural networks to the nonsmooth activation function . Even if the activation is smooth , the neural network is not L-smooth when w is unbounded , e.g. , considering f ( w ) =w1 * w_2 * w_3 . Questions : 1 . It is assumed that \\ell ( . ) is 1-smooth . Fundamentally , is this crucial and why ? I am not clear about this , especially considering that the inner function of the composite , i.e. , h_i , is nonsmooth .", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "reply_text": "Thanks for your helpful comments . * * Q : Do we really need to assume that $ \\ell $ is 1-smooth ? * * A : We can just assume $ \\ell $ to be $ \\beta $ -smooth for some $ \\beta > 0 $ . Our theorems still hold in general with minor changes in some constants depending on $ \\beta $ . We assume $ \\ell $ to be 1-smooth in the paper is mostly for the following reasons : ( 1 ) simplicity and reader-friendly , ( 2 ) most commonly used loss functions are indeed 1-smooth e.g. , square loss , negative entropy , and L2-hinge loss . * * Q : The smoothness of neural networks ? * * A : Thanks for pointing out this question . Yes , we totally agree that neural networks with smooth activation can still be nonsmooth globally . But we may have smoothness if we are allowed to constrain the parameters of each layer to have bounded norm i.e. , $ \\| W_i \\| \\leq B~ \\forall i \\in [ n ] $ .
