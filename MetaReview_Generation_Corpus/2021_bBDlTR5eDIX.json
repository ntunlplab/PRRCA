In particular , they propose a hierarchical discrete latent variable model that compresses videos into a latent space . An autoregressive model is then used to model dynamics in this latent space , which has reduced dimensionality , and can be used together with the VQVAE decoder to predict video . Empirical results show that this model is comparable to SOTA GAN models and a human evaluation suggests that humans have a preference for the VQVAE generations . # # # STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES [ + ] Good empirical results [ - ] Reduced novelty [ - ] Weak empirical section - only one dataset , limited comparison to baselines , missing details [ - ] Some claims are not properly justified # # # DETAILED COMMENTS The main positive aspect of the paper are its results . The authors show that , for the Kinetics-600 dataset , their approach performs similarly to SOTA GAN methods based on the FVD metric . Further , they conduct a human evaluation that indicates that their generations might be preferable to those from GANs . However , this empirical evaluation is quite limited . The authors only show results for the Kinetics-600 dataset . It is true that this is one of the largest scale video datasets and that it is quite challenging . However , the authors could have shown results for other datasets ( UCF101 , Kitti/Cityscapes/BDD100K , etc . ) that offer different trade-offs between complexity and amount of available data ( note that for example BDD100K is in the same order of magnitude as Kinetics in terms of data available ) and show the performance of their method on those datasets . Furthermore , that would allow a more direct comparison to some previous baselines including non-GAN approaches . The authors could also show different metrics beyond FVD ) to assess the performance of their method - video prediction evaluation is an open research question and some metrics are known to have shortcomings , but given that there is no ideal metric then having multiple metrics could help have a better understanding on the model strengths and weaknesses . Another issue is the missing details in terms of architectural choices , optimization hyperparameters , computational requirements , training time , etc . These are important to be able to replicate the results and to assess the potential impact of the method , as many video generation/prediction models have large computational requirements that have prevented a wider adoption of some of these methods . One of the main shortcomings of the paper is its novelty . The paper is a straightforward application of the VQVAE2 model to 4D tensors ( video ) and for video prediction . The original VQVAE paper already shows some results on video , contrary to the claim that `` this is the first application of VQVAE to video data '' . Further , using autoregressive models for video is a common approach ( Video Pixel Networks , Weissenborn et al.2020 ) , and using an autoregressive model on the latent space of a discrete latent variable model is common in all VQVAE approaches . There is merit in showing that this setup works for video prediction , but nothing about the setup is novel . Finally , there are some claims in the paper that are factually or arguably incorrect . These have not directly influenced my score , but I believe they should be addressed should the paper be accepted . First the authors claim `` we know of no attempt to predict video at resolutions beyond 64x64 , except for flow models '' . Clark et al. , Castrejon et al.and even the codebase for Denton and Fergus , Lee et al.all have results/models for video prediction at 128x128 . Second , the authors claim that most video prediction methods have skewed towards using GANs . This is arguably not true , I believe most GAN models perform video * generation * ( Vondrick , Tulyakov ) and most current video * prediction * models are based on VAEs ( Denton , Babaeizadeh , Lee , Castrejon , Villegas , etc . ) . This is due to the fact that usually it is hard to get GANs to cover all modes and usually they perform better for unconstrained generation rather that conditional generation/prediction . In any case , this is debatable and as such it should be clarified or toned down in the paper . Some of the other unjustified claims include `` this model being the first application of VQVAE to video data '' as discussed . # # # SCORE Overall I think this is a borderline paper .

VAEs often assume a prior with a continuous probability distribution , while VQ-VAE assumes a discrete one . A discrete latent representation of the input space makes the generation problem more tractable . We agree that [ 3 ] has tackled high-resolution video prediction and will include this citation ; however they applied their model to highly constrained datasets such as Human3.6 , KITTI , and Robot Pushing Datasets . High resolution models have never scaled to complex , unconstrained video datasets . Evaluation of video prediction and generative models broadly is still an open problem . We believe that the FVD has flaws ; nevertheless we report it given its established presence in prior work . The FVD focuses on high frequency details that humans often do not notice . Prior work [ 4 ] demonstrates that classifier-based metrics such as FVD harm VQ-based models which discard high-frequency information via lossy compression . Another route could be log-likelihood . Given that one of our main goals is sample quality , log-likelihood metrics are not great for evaluating and comparing models [ 5 ] . This would be especially problematic given that many of our baselines are GANs . The last route could be PSNR or SSIM on the predicted frames , but these metrics are not suitable for multi-modal problems such as video prediction . Using PSNR or SSIM for model selection would lead to averaging over all possible outcomes , leading to blurry predictions . A perceptual metric such as LPIPS does not incorporate this stochasticity either . These issues motivate us to include a human evaluation in our submission given that human-perceived sample quality is our main goal . We can add more examples in the appendix . We can also add the ground-truth next to the prediction output , but we are not sure how informative this would be .

SSIM and LPIPS are other common metrics together with FVD . 3.It is not easy to judge the output quality by just looking at the prediction in Figure 4 . Adding the ground truth next to the prediction output would be very helpful . 4.Also , providing more output videos in appendix/supplementary materials will be useful . - Minor comments : - Table 2 caption needs a description of FVD * . - [ 1 ] Klushyn , et al. , Learning Hierarchical Priors in VAEs , NeurIPS 2019 .

VAEs often assume a prior with a continuous probability distribution , while VQ-VAE assumes a discrete one . A discrete latent representation of the input space makes the generation problem more tractable . We agree that [ 3 ] has tackled high-resolution video prediction and will include this citation ; however they applied their model to highly constrained datasets such as Human3.6 , KITTI , and Robot Pushing Datasets . High resolution models have never scaled to complex , unconstrained video datasets . Evaluation of video prediction and generative models broadly is still an open problem . We believe that the FVD has flaws ; nevertheless we report it given its established presence in prior work . The FVD focuses on high frequency details that humans often do not notice . Prior work [ 4 ] demonstrates that classifier-based metrics such as FVD harm VQ-based models which discard high-frequency information via lossy compression . Another route could be log-likelihood . Given that one of our main goals is sample quality , log-likelihood metrics are not great for evaluating and comparing models [ 5 ] . This would be especially problematic given that many of our baselines are GANs . The last route could be PSNR or SSIM on the predicted frames , but these metrics are not suitable for multi-modal problems such as video prediction . Using PSNR or SSIM for model selection would lead to averaging over all possible outcomes , leading to blurry predictions . A perceptual metric such as LPIPS does not incorporate this stochasticity either . These issues motivate us to include a human evaluation in our submission given that human-perceived sample quality is our main goal . We can add more examples in the appendix . We can also add the ground-truth next to the prediction output , but we are not sure how informative this would be . We emphasize that the problem of video prediction is not deterministic ; the goal is to learn an accurate distribution of multiple future outcomes in the video .
