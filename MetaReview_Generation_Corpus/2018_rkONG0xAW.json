Two main problems exist in end devices for deep learning: power and memory. There have been a series of works showing how to discretisize neural networks. This work, discretisize a NN incrementally. It does so in the following way: First, we train the network with the memory we have. Once we train and achieve a network with best performance under this constraint, we take the sign of each weight (and leave them intact), and use the remaining n-1 bits of each weight in order to add some new connections to the network. Now, we do not change the sign weights, only the new n-1 bits. We continue with this process (recursively) until we don't get any improvement in performance. Based on experiments done by the authors, on MNIST, having this procedure gives the same performance with 3-4 times less memory or increase in performance of 1% for the same memory as regular network. I like the idea, and I think it is indeed a good idea for IoT and end devices. The main problem with this method that there is undiscussed payment with current hardware architectures. I think there is a problem with optimizing the memory after each stage was trained. Also, current architectures do not support a single bit manipulations, but is much more efficient on large bits registers. So, in theory this might be a good idea, but I think this idea is not out-of-the-box method for implementation. Also, as the authors say, more experiments are needed in order to understand the regime in which this method is efficient.

First of all , from the results on arithmetic complexity Table 2 , it is noticed that the extra computation brought by the proposed RBNN are shift and add , and multiplication computation are the same for RBNN and conventional BNN . Since multiplication has much more overhead than add and shift , the final computation increase is not significant .

The idea is to start by training a very small network, binarise this network, then reuse the non-signed bits of the binarised weights to add/store new weights, and recursively repeat these steps. The cost of reducing the memory storage is the extra computation. An experiment on MNIST shows the efficacy of the proposed recursive scheme. Quality and significance: The proposed method is a combination of the binarised neural network (BNN) architecture of Courbariaux et al. (2015; 2016) with a network growing scheme to reduce the number of bits per weight. However, the computation complexity is significantly larger. The pitch of the paper is to reduce the \"high overhead of data access\" when training NNs on small devices and indeed this seems to be the case as shown in the experiment. However, if the computation is that large compared to the standard BNNs, I wonder if training is viable on small devices after all. Perhaps all aspects (training cost [computation + time], accuracy and storage) should be plotted together to see what methods form the frontier. This is probably out of scope for ICLR but to really test these methods, they should be trained/stored on a real small device and trained/fine-tuned using user data to see what would work best.
