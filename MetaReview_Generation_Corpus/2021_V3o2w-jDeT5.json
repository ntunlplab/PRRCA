Again , this is a question of clarification and can easily be addressed . Thank you for your comment . Yes , you are true that models are trained using training data with our variance reduced estimator as their objective during HPO . As we discussed in the Introduction part that there are some previous solutions for training predictors under the covariate shift setting . However , we argue that there is no work that explores how HPO should be done in similar settings . Therefore , in this work , we focus on a new HPO setting we call MSU-HPO . In addition , the model training ( statistical machine learning ) and the hyperparameter optimization are based on completely different formulations ( though they seem to be similar ) . Therefore , even if there are some similar methods that are known to work well on the model training tasks , developing an HPO method for the corresponding problem setting is of independent interest . > The fact that the Naive method beats the other two baselines and performs comparably to the unbiased proposed method makes me wonder whether ( a ) these are challenging enough tasks , or ( b ) those are competitive baselines . The poor performances of DistBO and LI are not that strange , as they are the methods for conventional HPO problems , not for MSU-HPO . The HPO experiments are very challenging for the proposed method due to the small number of training data . If the number of data and the number of evaluations are large enough , the proposed method can find the optimal solution , as we analyzed in Appendix C. In contrast , DistBO and LI do not have such a guarantee . DistBO and LI are not methods for MSU-HPO and are not strong enough as baseline methods . However , as far as we know , there is no method that suits MSU-HPO . We think that MSU-HPO is most close to the DistBO setting , and we believe that the experimental comparisons are reasonable ."}, {"review_id": "V3o2w-jDeT5-2", "review_text": "The paper introduces multi-source unsupervised hyperparameter optimization ( MSU-HPO ) , a novel BO framework where a range of related tasks are available but labels can not be accessed for the target task .

This enables HPO to be run to optimize the hyperparameters on the target task , converging faster to a good hyperparameter configuration .

This is secondary considering that the theoretical analysis is solid , but tuning a wider range of ML algorithms ( such as neural networks/NAS ) would have made the case even stronger by showing that transfer learning is possible across a diverse class of models .

While many transfer learning baselines are inapplicable as most assume target labels to be available ( as discussed in the related work ) , this is not the case for all of them . An example is Feurer , et al . : Initializing Bayesian hyperparameter optimization via meta-learning , AAAI , 2015 . This is not referenced but should be discussed , as it only uses hyperparameter configurations from previous related tasks to warm-start the new optimization . As this does not look at the labels of the target task , it could be compared against . This is also the case for Perrone et al. , 2019 , which learn a search space purely based on previous tasks and does not require target labels .

Instead labels are estimated based on related tasks that do have labels . After this a predictor can be trained on those estimated labels , and can be tuned using a standard Bayesian optimization algorithm . The main contribution consist in the description of an estimator for the labels . The paper also provides basic experimental results , both in the form of a naive toy example , and of results on two machine learning datasets . # # # Questions / Comments The paper is described ( and titled ) as a HP tuning paper . But to me it appears to mainly be concerned with unsupervised training , when there are related labeled datasets available , and should thus be described , analysed and tested mainly as such , and compared to other unsupervised learning techniques . The fact that it can be combined with any supervised learning method and can incorporate hyperparameter ( HP ) tuning is interesting , but the end results is still a unsupervised prediction model . In this framing , the comparison only HP tuning algorithms not made for the specific setting does not seem to be the right comparison . Thus I argue that the results are not sufficient to show that the technique proposed can be useful in practice . The results are compared to existing HP Tuning warm start algorithms by getting a single suggested HP configuration . One detail that I do not understand from the text is how the HPs found by the baseline are evaluated , if no available labels are assumed . Can the authors shed more light on this aspect ? As the authors themselves note , the baselines are not well suited for the setting , where we have a very low transfer budget to be split among many source tasks . I would expect much simpler baselines to perform much better , for example : 1 ) just using the default HPs of the given algorithm 2 ) running on a single arbitrary source task the whole budget as a simple BO task , and use the best found HPs of this source task . ( But it is still not clear how finding HPs is useful if we have no labels , so I might be missing something major here ) . The description of the baseline they call `` Naive '' is also not very clear . If would be good to have more details on this baseline . In Experimental Procedure , What does ( 1 ) do ? How is the ML model tuned if not by MSU-HPO , which seems to be done later . It is not clear to me from the text . To summarize , while the method is interesting , it is insufficiently motivated , either as a special type of unsupervised learning , or if it is something different a stronger motivation of why this is worthwhile ( you can plug in arbitrary models , use arbitrary HP , tuning algorithms or other reasons ) . Additionally , the experiments would benefit from clearer descriptions and stronger baselines . # # # Typos Figure 1b : Comapring - > Comparing Table 1 caption : performs almost the same with naive in Parkinson given their standard errors - > grammar should be improved", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "reply_text": "We would like to thank the reviewer for his/her useful , detailed feedback .

But to me it appears to mainly be concerned with unsupervised training , when there are related labeled datasets available First of all , thank you for making a significant and interesting point . Let us discuss this point in detail . We think that our work lies on HPO because the aim of this paper is to obtain the optimal set of hyperparameters , and the proposed method is general purpose for HPO ( , i.e. , the proposed method does not depend on any specific machine learning models ) . However , we completely agree that this work is different from conventional HPO approaches , which formulate HPO as black-box optimization . This means that , even if there are related datasets , the conventional HPO approaches do not use the training data ( X , y ) * explicitly * and perform optimization using only the information of the hyperparameters and their evaluation values . MSU-HPO can not be solved without utilizing the information of these training data . As far as we know , for the first time in this study , we put something structure in the related data to streamline HPO explicitly , and perhaps this is what makes this study less like HPO . We agree that our approach is very unique in HPO ; however , we strongly believe that this study will narrow the gap between the fields of HPO and statistical machine learning , where it is common to make explicit assumptions about data distributions . We hope that our work opens up new research directions of HPO . > One detail that I do not understand from the text is how the HPs found by the baseline are evaluated , if no available labels are assumed . > In Experimental Procedure , What does ( 1 ) do ? The baseline methods such as \u201c Naive \u201d and \u201c LI \u201d perform optimization by using only source tasks , instead of an unlabeled target task . The best hyperparameter found in the optimization of source tasks is used to calculate the final evaluation value . This is described in Step ( 1 ) of \u2018 Experimental Procedure \u2019 in Section 4.2 . DistBO uses the unlabeled dataset of the target task as well as the labeled datasets of the source tasks ( please see Appendix D.2 for the details ) . > As the authors themselves note , the baselines are not well suited for the setting Thank you for pointing it out .

Is this expected ? Does this indicate that the chosen baselines ( LI and DISTBO ) may be too weak ? These baseline methods ( LI and DistBO ) are , at least , powerful methods for a standard HPO setting with labeled target task , as reported in their papers . While we discuss the reason why their results were poor in Appendix D.3 , no further details have been investigated yet . There is a possibility that HPO methods other than these methods will work well in MSU-HPO . Hence , a comprehensive comparison between other methods ( pointed out by the reviewer ) and the proposed methods is included in the future work . > Would it then not be useful to re-run the comparison under a varying number of hyperparameter evaluations available from source tasks ? Thank you for the helpful comment . We agree that the suggested experiment is important in confirming the scope of application of the proposed method . We would like to note that the proposed method can unbiasedly estimate the target task objective in the MSU-HPO setting , but LI and DistBO do not . In other words , there is no guarantee that the estimation of LI and DistBO will match the true objective no matter how much the training data and the number of evaluations increase . Note that we analyze the dependence of the proposed method on the number of data and the number of evaluations of the estimation accuracy in Appendix C. > c.

Instead labels are estimated based on related tasks that do have labels . After this a predictor can be trained on those estimated labels , and can be tuned using a standard Bayesian optimization algorithm . The main contribution consist in the description of an estimator for the labels . The paper also provides basic experimental results , both in the form of a naive toy example , and of results on two machine learning datasets . # # # Questions / Comments The paper is described ( and titled ) as a HP tuning paper . But to me it appears to mainly be concerned with unsupervised training , when there are related labeled datasets available , and should thus be described , analysed and tested mainly as such , and compared to other unsupervised learning techniques . The fact that it can be combined with any supervised learning method and can incorporate hyperparameter ( HP ) tuning is interesting , but the end results is still a unsupervised prediction model . In this framing , the comparison only HP tuning algorithms not made for the specific setting does not seem to be the right comparison . Thus I argue that the results are not sufficient to show that the technique proposed can be useful in practice . The results are compared to existing HP Tuning warm start algorithms by getting a single suggested HP configuration . One detail that I do not understand from the text is how the HPs found by the baseline are evaluated , if no available labels are assumed . Can the authors shed more light on this aspect ? As the authors themselves note , the baselines are not well suited for the setting , where we have a very low transfer budget to be split among many source tasks . I would expect much simpler baselines to perform much better , for example : 1 ) just using the default HPs of the given algorithm 2 ) running on a single arbitrary source task the whole budget as a simple BO task , and use the best found HPs of this source task . ( But it is still not clear how finding HPs is useful if we have no labels , so I might be missing something major here ) . The description of the baseline they call `` Naive '' is also not very clear . If would be good to have more details on this baseline . In Experimental Procedure , What does ( 1 ) do ? How is the ML model tuned if not by MSU-HPO , which seems to be done later . It is not clear to me from the text . To summarize , while the method is interesting , it is insufficiently motivated , either as a special type of unsupervised learning , or if it is something different a stronger motivation of why this is worthwhile ( you can plug in arbitrary models , use arbitrary HP , tuning algorithms or other reasons ) . Additionally , the experiments would benefit from clearer descriptions and stronger baselines . # # # Typos Figure 1b : Comapring - > Comparing Table 1 caption : performs almost the same with naive in Parkinson given their standard errors - > grammar should be improved", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "reply_text": "We would like to thank the reviewer for his/her useful , detailed feedback . We will update the paper with the suggested minor revisions and respond below to some concrete questions/comments . > The paper is described ( and titled ) as a HP tuning paper . But to me it appears to mainly be concerned with unsupervised training , when there are related labeled datasets available First of all , thank you for making a significant and interesting point . Let us discuss this point in detail . We think that our work lies on HPO because the aim of this paper is to obtain the optimal set of hyperparameters , and the proposed method is general purpose for HPO ( , i.e. , the proposed method does not depend on any specific machine learning models ) . However , we completely agree that this work is different from conventional HPO approaches , which formulate HPO as black-box optimization . This means that , even if there are related datasets , the conventional HPO approaches do not use the training data ( X , y ) * explicitly * and perform optimization using only the information of the hyperparameters and their evaluation values . MSU-HPO can not be solved without utilizing the information of these training data . As far as we know , for the first time in this study , we put something structure in the related data to streamline HPO explicitly , and perhaps this is what makes this study less like HPO . We agree that our approach is very unique in HPO ; however , we strongly believe that this study will narrow the gap between the fields of HPO and statistical machine learning , where it is common to make explicit assumptions about data distributions . We hope that our work opens up new research directions of HPO . > One detail that I do not understand from the text is how the HPs found by the baseline are evaluated , if no available labels are assumed . > In Experimental Procedure , What does ( 1 ) do ? The baseline methods such as \u201c Naive \u201d and \u201c LI \u201d perform optimization by using only source tasks , instead of an unlabeled target task . The best hyperparameter found in the optimization of source tasks is used to calculate the final evaluation value . This is described in Step ( 1 ) of \u2018 Experimental Procedure \u2019 in Section 4.2 . DistBO uses the unlabeled dataset of the target task as well as the labeled datasets of the source tasks ( please see Appendix D.2 for the details ) . > As the authors themselves note , the baselines are not well suited for the setting Thank you for pointing it out . We agree that the baseline methods are not suitable for the MSU-HPO setting , as described in Appendix D.3 . We appreciate the suggestion of baseline methods , and will compare that baselines in the future revision . > The description of the baseline they call `` Naive '' is also not very clear . If would be good to have more details on this baseline . In the MSU-HPO setting , the labeled data of the target task is not available for conventional HPO methods . Therefore , the \u201c Naive \u201d method uses the data of the labeled source tasks for training , and does not use any information about the unlabeled target task . Specifically , the \u201c Naive \u201d method prepares the concatenation of ( labeled ) source tasks , and splits it into training and validation data . After that , perform the experiment according to the procedure in Experimental Procedure of Section 4.2 ."}}
