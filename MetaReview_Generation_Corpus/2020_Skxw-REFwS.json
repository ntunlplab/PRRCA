The proposed architecture is made of a layer-wise k-means structure (more specifically a epsilon-means approach, where the epsilon is adaptively defined from the distortion percentile). Each layer is associated a scope (patch dimensions); each patch of the image is associated its nearest cluster center (or a new cluster is created if needed); new cluster centers are adjusted to fit the examples (Short Term Memory); clusters that have been visited sufficiently many time are frozen (Long Term Memory). Each cluster is associated a label distribution from the labelled examples. The label for each new image is obtained by a vote of the clusters and layers.\n\nSome reviews raise some issues about the robustness of the approach, and its sensitivity w.r.t. hyper-parameters. Some claims (\"the distribution associated to a class may change with time\") are not experimentally confirmed; it seems that in such a case, the LTM size might grow along time; a forgetting mechanism would then be needed to enforce the tractability of classification. \n\nSome claims (the mechanism is related to how animal learn) are debatable, as noted by Rev#1; see hippocampal replay.\n\nThe area chair thinks that a main issue with the paper is that the Unsupervised Progressive Learning is considered to be a new setting (\"none of the existing approaches in the literature are directly applicable to the UPL problem\"), preventing the authors from comparing their results with baselines.\n\nHowever, after a short bibliographic search, some related approaches exist under another name:\n* Incremental Semi-supervised Learning on Streaming Data, Pattern Recognition 88, Li et al., 2018;\n* Incremental Semi-Supervised Learning from Streams for Object Classification, Chiotellis et al., 2018;\n* Online data stream classification with incremental semi-supervised learning, Loo et al., 2015.\n\nThe above approaches seem able to at least accommodate the Uniform UPL scenario. I therefore encourage the authors to consider some of the above as baselines and provide a comparative validation of STAM.", "reviews": [{"review_id": "Skxw-REFwS-0", "review_text": "The paper presents a new problem formulation in the broader area of lifelong learning. Specifically, the Unsupervised Progressive Learning (UPL) problem, requires a learner to consume a stream of data, where each data point is associated with a class, but only very few labels are provided. Similar to continuous learning the learner can only access current and not access previous data in the stream. The paper clearly describes how this setup is different to commonly other learning setups studied, including continual learning. To solve this problem the paper proposes a deep-learning-free approach based on clustering and novelty detection. Strength: - I think the problem formulation is very realistic and interesting and I am not aware of it being explored previously - The newly proposed architecture STAM is also interesting. - The paper evaluates STAM on UPL on three datasets, MNIST, EMNIST, SVHN - The paper ablates several aspects of the model evaluates the effect of hyper parameters.

The paper argues that deep learning cannot work, I am wondering, why don\u2019t include standard baselines, e.g. auto-encoder based with a prototype stored whenever a labeled example is seen.

The UPL problem makes sense to me, however, the experimental setup could be improved. Specifically, the paper uses the entire dataset to find hyperparameters. This is highly concerning as this basically means the entire dataset has been seen multiple times before the final pass over the dataset (the one with the best hyperparameters) is performed. This is basically a contradiction to the setup of UPL, which assumes all data is seen only once. 3. Related Work: 3.1. [A] seems to study a similar setup and proposes an approach which should also be applicable in this work. Conclusion: The paper\u2019s contribution is a new learning setup (UPL) and an approach (STAM). While it remains unclear if STAM can generalize to realistic images, the idea of UPL is very interesting and speaks for accepting the paper, although there are several weaknesses the authors should address. It would also be great if the authors plan to release the exact experimental setup (i.e. which images are sampled in which order and which ones are labeled) so future work can compare to this work.

The motivation of this paper is quite interesting in that the authors try to mimic how animals learn. The surrounding environments of animals are considered to be unlabeled, and animals gradually learn to distinguish between objects without explicit information. The model shed light on the problem of catastrophic forgetting by introducing dual-memory organization. To be specific, Short-Term Memory contains a set of centroids associated with the unlabeled data, whereas Long-Term Memory stores the prototypical centroids, which are frequently seen patterns. In addition, the model utilizes novelty detection technique to introduce new centroids to each layer of the model, and it prepares the newly created centroids to be associated with new classes. Overall, the paper reads well and it is self-explanatory with clear notations and hyperparameters. Each step of the architecture is well-formulated mathematically and the necessity of the step in the model is explained clearly. The problem proposed, Unsupervised Progressive Learning (UPL) problem, is novel. On the other hand, there are shortcomings of the paper, one being the model evaluation on dataset such as MNIST, SVHN, and EMNIST. The dimensional size of the dataset and the number of classes are small which is not convincing to evaluate the performance of the model. In addition, each layer of the model is independent from other layers (no connections between units at different layers), keeping the updated representation of patches to itself. This fact would hinder the model from understanding complex representation. Furthermore, there is a concern on the use of L2 distance metric for the similarity between the patch and patterns (centroids). L2 is not meaningful in high dimensional spaces. This paper is a good start in tackling the Unsupervised Progressive Learning problem, but some weaknesses are present in the nature of the model architecture as mentioned above. However, the approach taken appears to be ad hoc. It is difficult to imagine the method can work for more complex situations. Even for the small datasets used in the paper, the learning require 10\u2019s of thousands of training example. This does not mimic animal learning at all.

The paper also introduces a new model designed to approach this problem, called the STAM architecture, with many concepts applied in a novel way. The STAM architecture is tested on example problems from the UPL problem. I find this paper to approach a problem that is not well studied in the literature, and it is well-written and easy to read. I am not aware of previous works that tackle this specific problem setup. Many previous works seem to slowly be converging to tackling this kind of problem, but this is the first work that directly tackles this realistic problem. It would be good if the authors made the benchmark (/how they are generated) public. The STAM architecture is an interesting way of tackling image classification, and it is refreshing to see a technique not dependent on neural networks. The experiments in the paper are extremely detailed, with good figures and ablation studies. I am recommending this paper be accepted. But I have one main question about this work: what is the memory cost of the STAM architecture? Many 1000s of LTM centroids are stored, what is the memory cost of this? Is this memory cost greater than the cost of just storing all the labelled inputs that have been seen? I would imagine that just replaying these stored labelled inputs (or just training a NN on these stored inputs) would provide extremely high accuracies for the datasets considered in this paper. I understand that STAM has potential beyond just replaying memory for potentially larger datasets; the authors also make the point that they do not believe that the brain works by replaying memory. However, I would then like to see one (or both) of the following tests: a run with much fewer LTM centroids (with the corresponding memory cost detailed explicitly), and/or a dataset where it is clear that the memory cost incurred by the STAM architecture is a better use of memory than just storing previous data. I would also argue that the brain *does* replay memory in some manner in order to learn. But that is a debate for another time! By fixing the LTM centroids that are learnt on previous data, the method is essentially freezing previous knowledge and then learning new knowledge by increasing model capacity. It would be interesting (as future work / other papers) to see an adopted version of eg Progressive Neural Networks and how that compares on the same benchmarks. I would also be interested to see, as future work, the uncertainty estimates of this new architecture and its robustness to adversarial examples. Finally, a couple of minor points: - Figure 4 is small and hard to read, particularly the left column. - The authors find (in Appendix E) that increasing the \\Delta hyperparameter leads to a growing number of LTM centroids.

We calculate ( for the case of SVHN ) , how many pixels would be required -- and what is the equivalent number of SVHN images -- based on the number of learned centroids in both Short-Term Memory and Long-Term Memory . Please note that in the submitted paper we did not optimize STAM in terms of memory efficiency .
