However , it can be seen from Fig.6 that some details are still lost by GAN inversion . `` * * We agree , there is a trade-off between editing within image space and editing in the latent space of a GAN . An advantage of image editing in the latent space of a GAN : discovered latent variable manipulations permit continuous semantic image edits for multiple pixels using a lower-dimensional space . However , current latent-space editing approaches surely depend on GAN inversion for real image editing . In this work , we mainly focus on finding a more controllable navigation strategy for image editing . Nonetheless , we notice that multiple GAN inversion methods ( Fang et al.2019 ; Zhu et al.2020 ) were proposed recently , which may help to further improve the results . 3 . * * '' In terms of simultaneous multiple attribute transformations , it is interesting to refer to the following reference to guarantee the latent consistency in the proposed framework : [ r1 ] Inducing Optimal Attribute Representations for Conditional GANs , ECCV 2020 . `` * * Thanks a lot , we appreciate the reference to more literature .

The approach allows for the manipulation of single or multiple various image attributes , while preserving the identity of the original image in contrast to the baseline method of Shen et . al 2019.The method focuses on the manipulation of the latent space , in contrast to the popular image space editing methods . The paper is easy to read and understand . The authors have presented their method and analysis which are clear and understandable , supported quite well with the provided examples and figures . # # # # Strengths : Experiments are conducted on various datasets and compared to various methods - supervised and unsupervised Their method is able to consistently preserve the image content ( in case of scenes ) and identity ( in case of faces ) Showing inversion results along the transformation shows the robustness and tractable nature of their method . # # # # Weakness : It is not entirely clear how the local transformation are discovered for different z values independently , or rather what the difference is in discovering the global transformation vs discovering the local transformation # # # # Questions to the Authors : 1 .
