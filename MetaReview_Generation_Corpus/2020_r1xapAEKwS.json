{"year": "2020", "forum": "r1xapAEKwS", "title": "SDGM: Sparse Bayesian Classifier Based on a Discriminative Gaussian Mixture Model", "decision": "Reject", "meta_review": "This paper presents a method for merging a discriminative GMM with an ARD sparsity-promoting prior.  This is accomplished by nesting the ARD prior update within a larger EM-based routine for handling the GMM, allowing the model to automatically remove redundant components and improve generalization.  The resulting algorithm was deployed on standard benchmark data sets and compared against existing baselines such as logistic regression, RVMs, and SVMs.\n\nOverall, one potential weakness of this paper, which is admittedly somewhat subjective, is that the exhibited novelty of the proposed approach is modest.  Indeed ARD approaches are now widely used in various capacities, and even if some hurdles must be overcome to implement the specific marriage with a discriminative GMM as reported here, at least one reviewer did not feel that this was sufficient to warrant publication.  Other concerns related to the experiments and comparison with existing work.  For example, one reviewer mentioned comparisons with Panousis et al., \"Nonparametric Bayesian Deep Networks with Local Competition,\" ICML 2019 and requested a discussion of differences.  However, the rebuttal merely deferred this consideration to future work and provided no feedback regarding similarities or differences.  In the end, all reviewers recommended rejecting this paper and I did not find any sufficient reason to overrule this consensus.", "reviews": [{"review_id": "r1xapAEKwS-0", "review_text": "The paper presents an alternative to densely connected shallow classifiers or the conventional penultimate layers (softmax) of conventional deep network classifiers.

The method aims to have a flexible decision boundary due to the mixture model as well as to generalize well owing to the sparse learning strategy. While the method incorporates distinct ideas in the literature such as increased model complexity and use of a sparse prior, the paper needs more clearer explanation of the method design and careful empirical investigation. My major concerns are as follows. 1) Explanation of the learning algorithm of Section 2.2 is unsatisfactory. Specifically, the objective function and the principle of algorithm are unclear. My guess is: * c, m and T, z are equivalent. (T, z are one-hot representation of c, m.) * The objective is to maximize the conditional probability of equation (1) given labeled data (x, t). * This maximization is carried out in a similar way to the EM algorithm where m (or z) is regarded as a latent variable. This gives equation (9). * A MAP estimate of parameter w is calculated using the prior (8). Assuming the points above, I am still unsure about the following points: 1-a) How is the sparsity induced? The prior of w seems to have the l2 regularizer, but how are \\pi and r pulled toward zero? 1-b) How is the update of \\alpha (17) derived? Does this strengthen the sparsity by increasing \\alpha given small \\hat{w}? What is the \"orthogonal component\" of \\Lambda? 1-c) Is structure in w ignored?
