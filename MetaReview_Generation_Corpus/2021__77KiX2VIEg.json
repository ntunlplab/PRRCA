More specifically , the authors artificially create training sets from CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets where the number of images per category is limited to 10-250 samples . Then , they compare the test performance of ResNet101 , an ensemble of 5 ResNet 20 and an ensemble of 20 ResNet8 , trained for classification with different loss functions , i.e.cross-entropy and cosine distance . The bottom line is that the ensembles work better and have a comparable computational complexity in FLOPs . Strengths : - The topic of the paper fits well in the paradigm of representation learning . - The work demonstrates that the community does not have a good understanding of what kind of models must be used when little data is available for training and brings attention to classical techniques for variance reduction . Weaknesses : - The paper is basically a compilation of experiments with no explanations of the observed phenomena . The authors perform a set of experiments with already known methods and merey propose the reader to look at the results . I would like to know not only that we need to do ensembles of small networks but also why these ensembles are more efficient than a single deep network in the low data scenario . Why do we observe the difference between using cross-entropy and cosine losses , depending on the network , dataset and its size ? - The novelty of the paper is limited . It is already known from [ 1 ] that using ensemble methods in few-shot problems helps the performance a lot . Even if the authors propose a different evaluation strategy , referencing existing work in this field is still required . - Abblation studies are missing . To be more convinced by the experiments I would like to see how the performance differes if you vary the ensemble size and the single network 's capacity . That may improve our understanding of the phenomena too . Experimenting with more datasets may help to answer the question of why the behavior of different loss functions is so different between the two used datasets . - A question of wheather a single ResNet101 with vanilla training is a fair baseline . It \u2019 s been known [ 2 ] that to achieve better results on a small-data task it is beneficial to train deeper networks with proper regularization rather than shallow networks . Using an ensemble of N networks is identical to using a single network where each layer is N times wider ; each convolutional layer will have N times more filters ( that could be obtained by concatenating the weights of the original network ) , however the convolution operation now changes from a standard to a grouped one ( has N groups ) . The resulting output of the fused network must be averaged across the groups to match the ensemble definition exactly . The group-separated convolutions restrict representational power of the network and introduce stronger regularization , which is most likely the reason for the ensemble to perform better . If we speak about regularizing ResNet101 what kind of regularization did you introduce to adapt it to the small size dataset ? It is possible that vanilla training with higher weight decay and more data augmentation is not actually efficient in the case of ResNet101 on the small datasets . Instead , it may require introducing more aggressive data aufmentation [ 3,4 ] or some structural changes must be introduced , as for example in [ 5 ] . Even though the direction of reserch is interesting and deffinitely useful for the community the work still needs development to be recommended for acceptance .

We definitely agree on the fact that the community does not have a clear idea on how to tackle the problem of learning from a small sample since this is a rarely experimented domain , yet very important in practice . For this reason , we fairly believe that the results reported in this revised version of our paper can be exploited by the community both as baselines for future works and as a practical guide for solving similar problems . We made several additions and changes to address the weakness of our paper : - In Section 5.4 we motivated the better sample efficiency of ensembles following models proposed in [ Geiger et al.2019 ] and [ Geiger et al.2020 ] that we noticed to be in accordance with our experimental findings . We also motivated the difference in performance among the two losses and provided a hypothesis following the model proposed in [ Geiger et al.2019 ] .- We added the reference to work [ Dvornik et al . ] since this is a use of ensembles in a somewhat related domain . However , we kindly point out that few-shot learning and learning from a small sample are implemented by the community in two different ways as we wrote in the introduction . Despite their names are semantically similar , in few-shot learning we still exploit a large base set from which it is possible to learn , \u201c as we know it with big and large nets \u201d , good representations that then we transfer to more tiny and difficult problems . In our scenario , the lack of data from the beginning presents different challenges that are still not clear to the community , as also noted by the Reviewer , and could not be encountered in few-shot learning . Therefore , in our opinion , it is not straightforward to assume that good performance of deep ensembles in few-shot learning would imply the same performance with small datasets . - We added several ablation studies regarding the variation of depth , width , and a number of nets in an ensemble . Refer to Tables 2 and 5 and , in particular , to Section 5.3 . Further , we added two more datasets ( SVHN and Stanford Dogs ) to get more solid empirical evidence . It is reasonable to doubt if a ResNet-110 is a fair baseline on small datasets . To better compare our results , we considered several more network architectures and layouts as baselines : ResNet-110 , VGG-9 , DenseNet-BC-52 , and DenseNet-BC-121 ; we varied the depth of baseline ResNets ( 26 , 50 , and 110 layers ) ; we added results of shallower and wider networks ( ResNet-8-16 , ResNet-8-36 , ResNet-8-50 , ResNet-8-72 ; VGG-5-32 , VGG-5-76 ; DenseNet-BC-16 ( k=12,30 ) , DenseNet-BC-62 ( k=32,56 ) ) . All the above architectures and layouts have been compared with the corresponding ensemble of networks of the same family with the same computational budget . In almost all cases , ensembles outperformed the deeper/wider variants , with clear margins , especially over deeper nets ( Tables 2 , 4 , 5 ) . As also suggested by the Reviewer , we made a test with stronger data augmentation on CIFAR-10 adding color distortion and random erasing but still obtained similar trends ( Table 5 ) .

First of all while Cifar-10 and Cifar-100 are great datasets that researchers should benchmark on , but for this line of work I would have liked to see more . How do these trends look like on ImageNet ? What about for non vision tasks , does something similar happen on SQUAD . Furthermore I 'd encourage the authors to explore the tradeoff between number of ensembles vs depth of network more . I 'd like to see a 2/3d plot with depth/size of network on one axis , and number of ensmbles on the other , how does the tradeoff frontier look like ? It is simply not convincing to just look at a resnet20 vs resnet-8 . I also find the loss comparison direction less interesting than the tradeoff between depth/width/number of ensembles .

Note also that in [ Bietti et al.2019 ] authors kept a held-out training set for tuning hyper-parameters while , in our case , we did n't do it and left default parameters . We definitely share the same objective and experimental evaluation with these two papers . Therefore , we agree on the fact that ours and their approaches are directly comparable . Instead , approaches proposed in [ Drucker and Lecun ] and [ Miyato et al . ] were not evaluated and tested on small image datasets falling outside the aim of our experimental evaluation . For what concerns evaluation , we used the same evaluation proposed in [ Arora et al.2020 ] repeating the same experiment multiple times ( i.e.different sub-sampled splits for each N ) and averaging the test accuracy obtained in each run ( i.e.the best testing accuracy scored by the model across the epochs ) . - We provided in the first submission and in this new version confidence estimates in terms of standard deviations for the different runs in all tables and plots . We added two more datasets ( SVHN and Stanford Dogs ) , we ran several experiments concerning the variation of depth and width ( Tables 2 and 5 ) and we discussed the results in Section 5.3 .

The paper is well laid out and the experiments are somewhat well motivated as , much experimental study in DL has been around * larger and larger * datasets . The paper seems well written and the experiments are well constructed with means and standard deviations reported for every experiment . These experiments do match prior subsampling experiments literature ( at least for Cifar-10 ) . One minor call out I 'd make is that Shankar Et al ( https : //arxiv.org/pdf/2003.02237.pdf ) shows that a non ensembled CNN has similar performance to a CNTK on subsampled Cifar-10 . My primary problem with this work is a the somewhat expected nature of the findings and the limited scope of the experiments . First of all while Cifar-10 and Cifar-100 are great datasets that researchers should benchmark on , but for this line of work I would have liked to see more . How do these trends look like on ImageNet ? What about for non vision tasks , does something similar happen on SQUAD . Furthermore I 'd encourage the authors to explore the tradeoff between number of ensembles vs depth of network more . I 'd like to see a 2/3d plot with depth/size of network on one axis , and number of ensmbles on the other , how does the tradeoff frontier look like ? It is simply not convincing to just look at a resnet20 vs resnet-8 . I also find the loss comparison direction less interesting than the tradeoff between depth/width/number of ensembles . Anyway the reason for my score is that this seems like a promising direction but looks like early work . With a couple more datasets and a more thorough experimentation section I 'd accept this paper .", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We appreciate that the Reviewer finds our work promising and well-motivated . We thank the reviewer for the provided suggestions that we addressed in the revised version of our manuscript : - We added two more popular datasets ( SVHN and Stanford Dogs ) . We added more vision tasks since our focus regards image classification and the computer vision field . It would be definitely interesting to try our approach to non-vision tasks . We left it as future work . - We explored more the trade-off between depth and ensembles dimension . More in detail , we varied the depth of the baseline network and the number of ensembles accordingly . We invite the Reviewer to refer to Figure 1 and Table 5 for the results . Moreover , we trained diverse architectures at different depths and compared them with the corresponding ensembles ( Table 2 ) . - We also added comparisons for the width dimension . More details are given in the reply to Reviewer 3 . In the revised version of the paper , the results of this analysis are in Tables 2 , 5 , and Figure 1 . We discussed these results in Section 5.3 ."}}
