We provided a detailed ablation study analyzing the effectiveness of each term in our proposed loss function in Sec.4.3.The conclusion is that disabling each of the model 's components leads to degraded performance . More precisely , the average drop by disabling the classifier entropy loss is about 3.5 % . Similarly , by disabling the reconstruction loss and the multi-domain separation loss , we have about 4.5 % and 22 % average drop in performance , respectively . Clearly , by disabling the multi-domain separation loss , the accuracy drops significantly due to the severe data distribution mismatch between different domains .

Hence , this is a standard single source single target domain adaptation , where the target contains multiple datasets without knowing which sample belongs to which dataset ( the domain label of the source samples are set to 0 , and the domain label of all target samples are set to 1 ) . s-MTDA-ITA : in this case , we consider a dataset ( for example SVHN ) as the source and another one ( MNIST ) as the target .

MTDA-ITA : for this case , we consider a dataset ( SVHN ) as source and consider others ( MNIST , MNIST-M , USPS ) as multiple disjoint target domains . Therefore , this setup corresponds to a novel setting where we adapt jointly multiple target domains .

Indeed , this is reflected in their focus on small datasets such as Office or Yale B , which are rarely used in modern domain adaptation evaluations . - Additionally , no comparisons are reported to state-of-the-art deep domain adaptation approaches , such as ADDA , DSN , DTN , DAAN , etc . - Moreover , although this paper claims to address a new setup where the target domains not necessarily share the same categories , it assumes that the source categories contain all target categories .

To the best of our knowledge , our work is a first work addressing this DA setting , showing that jointly adapting multiple target domains in a clever way offers empirical benefit over naive solutions ( combining all target datasets into single one or adapting each source-target separately ) . We note that Reviewer pointed to another recent work , published on arxiv 10 days prior to ICLR submission deadline , which considers a similar setting . We contrast our approach to theirs in the comment below . - Moreover , our paper offers a new justification of why the popular auto-encoder-based regularization ( derived from maximizing the mutual information between the samples and the latent features ) and classifier uncertainty minimization ( derived from minimizing the mutual information between the target latent features and class labels ) can work for domain adaptation from an information theoretic perspective ( see Sec.2.1 for more details ) . - We conducted extensive experiments with detailed ablation studies on three well-known domain adaptation benchmarks to validate our approach on multiple domain adaptation , demonstrating the superiority of our model over the state-of-the-art DA methods . `` Desirable to have a discussion and comparison with `` Multi-target Unsupervised Domain Adaptation without Exactly Shared Categories '' '' Thanks for pointing this out . - First of all , this paper addresses the one source , multiple target domain adaptation in the context of data clustering rather than data classification . Even tough the authors of the mentioned paper use the labels of the source samples and assume that the set of all classes in target domains is a subset of source classes , it is not clear why resort to reporting clustering performance instead of the classification scores . - The paper uses the sparse representation and dictionary learning framework for domain adaptation , making it less scalable to large dataset settings compared to our approach . Indeed , this is reflected in their focus on small datasets such as Office or Yale B , which are rarely used in modern domain adaptation evaluations . - Additionally , no comparisons are reported to state-of-the-art deep domain adaptation approaches , such as ADDA , DSN , DTN , DAAN , etc . - Moreover , although this paper claims to address a new setup where the target domains not necessarily share the same categories , it assumes that the source categories contain all target categories . By this assumption , there is no difference between this setup and the standard domain adaptation setup since the classifier is trained based on the labeled source samples and the domain alignment task is independent of the target categories ( due to the lack of labels in target domain ) ."}}
