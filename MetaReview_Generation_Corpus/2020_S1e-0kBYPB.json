The verification framework uses an RCNN to identify two types of tokens a) the tokens that are not predictive of outcome b) the subset of clearly relevant tokens for prediction. The data used for RCNN is a pruned version of the data used to train the black-box. The pruning eliminates data points to ensure that the tokens not selected by RCNN have no contribution to the outcome and that the model does not exhibit suffer from learning \"handshakes\". A handshake is defined as the set of tokens that may be spuriously missed because their information is encoded in another relevant token. This proof to identify such data points is shown and the RNN is therefore expected to be able to reliably identify 3 kinds of tokens a) Those that have zero contribution to the outcome. b) Those that definitely have some contribution to the outcome and c) those that could be relevant or noisy. Three instance-wise feature selection methods are compared. Results are provided on 3 metrics. a) % instances for which the most important tokes provided by the explainer is among the non-selected tokens, b) % of instances for which at least one non-selected token is ranked higher than a relevant token, and c) Average number of non-selected tokens ranked higher than any obviously relevant tokens. Clarifications and concerns: 1. For the dataset considered here, I would like to see the distribution of the irrelevant, clearly relevant and unsure if they are relevant tokens as detected by the RCNN. How does this change if I further prune the dataset after ensuring that handshake and other issues have been eliminated. The main concern I have is the idea of verifying other explanations using a neural network itself. I can train the RCNN neural network with half the data (and satisfy the properties the authors mention) and my evaluation would change significantly. From the appendix I see that most of the tokens could be in the set $SDR_x$. 2. What if the set of tokens don't overlap between the RCNN and the black-box to be verified. That said, I think the assumptions of the framework should be much more explicitly mentioned. 3. The std deviations in the experiments are very high. Can the authors justify this and how it is still okay to use this framework for evaluating feature importance based explanations. Minor: 1. You have cited the \"Anchors\" paper twice? 2.

The RCNN model which is defining the relevant and irrelevant tokens for a prediction task is in fact stating that we can explain the decision of an NLP model in terms of relevant and irrelevant tokens. Hence, the proposed RCNN can also be considered as an explainer.

Also, doing human evaluation is a strong way to justify an explainer. Though expensive, whenever possible it should be done and is in no way a limitation of current evaluation metrics. Your model needs labelled data for training RCNN. This adds a constraint on the usability and scalability of your proposed evaluation method. Since RCNN is also black-box, one will required another explainer to explain the RCNN. In the worst-case scenario, if RCNN is trained with data such that it considers all relevant words as irrelevant, the evaluation made by RCNN will be incorrect. Hence, \" Success depends on the ability of the RCNN to extract correct subsets of tokens.\" ------------------- BEFORE The paper proposed a verification framework to evaluate the performance of different explanatory methods in interpreting a given target model. Specifically, the authors evaluated three explanatory methods namely, LIME, SHAP and L2X for a target model trained to perform sentiment analysis on text data. Authors assume for each input text, there is a subset of tokens that are most relevant and that are completely irrelevant to the final prediction task. The proposed framework uses a recurrent convolutional neural network (RCNN) to find these subsets. The performance of an explainer is evaluated in terms of overlap between the RCNN most relevant tokens and the most relevant tokens provided by the explainer as an explanation. Major \u2022 The paper lack technical novelty. \u2022 The proposed architecture uses a RCNN to find the most relevant subset of tokens. Firstly, RCNN is also a black box that provides no intuition behind its selection decision. Secondly, in the absence of the ground truth labels for true relevance and irrelevance of a token in input sentence, this explainer method can also suffer from \u201cassuming a reasonable behavior\u201d assumption. The method assumes that the RCNN is performing reasonably in identifying relevant subsets. \u2022 The success of the method depends on the ability of the RCNN to extract correct subsets of tokens. The data used for training the RCNN, might have some underlying bias. In that case, the evaluation is not accurate. \u2022 In related work, for \u201cInterpretable target models\u201d the authors mentioned LIME as an example of explainer functions that explains target models that are \u201cvery simple models may not be representative for the large and intricate neural networks used in practice\u201d. LIME locally explains the decision of a complex function for a given data point using simpler models like linear regression. But LIME itself can be used for generating explanation for prediction of complex neural network like Inception Net. \u2022 The example used to explain the difference between feature additive and feature selection-based explainer methods, is confusing. Its not clear how in health diagnostics, one will prefer feature-selection perspective. Although the most relevant features used for the instance are important to understand the decision, but in clinical settings sometimes low rank features can also be useful to understand the target model. \u2022 For text, the relevant features are the individual tokens of the input sentence. Similarly, for images relevance can be important regions of the image. The authors did not have any experiments on images or tabular data. \u2022 In the experiment section, the comparison is made with only 3 explainer models and for just one task. The experiments are inadequate. \u2022 In Figure 4, the colormap is not readable. ", "rating": "3: Weak Reject", "reply_text": "REVIEWER : Lacks technical novelty . ANSWER : The novelty of our paper consists in the fact that , to our knowledge , it is the first to ( 1 ) shed light over a fundamental difference in the goals of two major types of explanations that are currently being directly compared despite their distinct goals , and ( 2 ) propose a methodology for evaluating explainers that does not make speculations on the behaviour of the model ( unlike evaluation type 3 , see our related work - Section 2 ) , which is based on a real-world scenario ( complex neural architectures and real-world datasets ) ( unlike evaluation types 1 and 2 ) , and without human intervention ( unlike evaluation type 4 ) . Consequently , we are also the first to test current state-of-the-art explainers in a setting having all the above features , pointing out some critical explainers ' deficiencies . R : Lack of intuition behind RCNN \u2019 s selection decision and assuming reasonable behavior of the RCNN . A : The general answer should help in clarifying this . The lack of intuition behind the RCNN \u2019 s selection decision does not affect the fact that , in the end , the non-selected tokens were irrelevant to the model \u2019 s predictions on the pruned datasets , nor that the clearly relevant tokens we identify are indeed among the ground truth relevant tokens for the trained RCNNs . We also do not assume that the RCNN has reasonable behavior in identifying correct subsets . The two pruning mechanisms in Section 4 ( `` eliminating handshakes '' and `` at least one clearly relevant feature '' ) are precisely how we guarantee ( as opposed to just assume ) that for each pair of ( trained model , pruned evaluation dataset ) the non-selected tokens are indeed irrelevant in the prediction of the trained models on the instances in their associated pruned datasets , and that there is a subset of at least 1 clearly relevant tokens in each instance of the pruned datasets . The behavior might also not be reasonable , as we explain in the answer below . R : Success depends on the ability of the RCNN to extract correct subsets of tokens . A : We do not assume any correctness ( wrt the original task ) of the selected tokens . Our evaluation is accurate even if the RCNN learns an underlying bias . Our handshake check ensures that the instances where a potential bias influences the prediction are either eliminated or the bias is reflected in the selected tokens . For example , suppose that the RCNN learned the bias : [ if \u2018 bottle \u2019 in input_text , then predict 1 ] ( \u2018 bottle \u2019 is a neutral word that should not indicate the most positive sentiment score of 1 ) . If for an instance containing \u2018 bottle \u2019 , the RCNN doesn \u2019 t select \u2018 bottle \u2019 ( which was its decision criteria ) , the instance would be detected as a handshake and eliminated from its associated pruned dataset . If the RCNN selects \u2018 bottle \u2019 , there are 2 possibilities : ( 1 ) we fail to identify it as clearly relevant , in which case our evaluation wouldn \u2019 t penalize the explainer for flagging it as relevant ; or ( 2 ) we identify \u2018 bottle \u2019 as clearly relevant , in which case our evaluation would penalize the explainer only if it ranks any irrelevant tokens higher than \u2018 bottle \u2019 ( since that shouldn \u2019 t be the case ) . In either of the cases , the evaluation is faithful to the trained model \u2019 s behavior , regardless of what its behavior is . R : Authors mentioned LIME as an example of explainer that explains \u201c very simple models may not be representative for the large and intricate neural networks used in practice \u201d . A : In the referred paragraph , we wrote that LIME was evaluated based on how correct it explains a simple model . Of course , LIME can be used to explain any complex model , and this is why we actually test it on a complex model like the RCNN . R : The example in Fig 1 is confusing . It \u2019 s not clear how in health diagnostics , one will prefer feature-selection perspective . A : Our example is only meant to show the difference between the two perspectives of explanations , and not that one perspective is better than the other . We now deleted the sentence where we expressed our own opinion that one might prefer the feature selection in individual decision-making tasks , as it was indeed simply our opinion and does not affect the rest of the work . R : More experiments A : Please see our general answer . R : Colormap is not readable . A : We will update it to make it more readable ."}, {"review_id": "S1e-0kBYPB-2", "review_text": "Overview/Contribution: ==================== The authors present a explanation generation framework that help validate post-hoc explanations when the explanations are generated based on feature selection. They claim to demonstrate their method by showing failure modes of exiting explanation generation methods. Overall, the paper is not ready to be accepted to the conference and I describe my rational with the following strengths and weaknesses. Strength: ======== + Explanations make models more transparent and easy to understand for end users of the decision made by complex models such as deep neural networks [1]. In that respect, having a verification mechanism for post-hoc explanations is interesting and useful. + The paper is easy to read and follow. Weakness: =========== - evaluating explanations generated for an opaque model with another opaque model (RCNN) is cyclical. - Just like many literature in this nascent space, interpretation (which is measuring the contribution of features or subsets of features towards predicted output) is confused as explanation. Human level explanations don\u2019t necessarily depend on the direct interaction or contribution of model derived features. Rather they describe \u2018why\u2019 the model come up with the decision produced. - Explanation generation is gaining traction in the deep learning community especially for critical applications such as healthcare and security. However, the authors claim that post-hoc explanations currently are only evaluated for only simple non-neural model. That is misleading given the recent attention toward generating explanations for various deep learning models. - As a generalized pos-hoc explanation generators verification framework, the experiments are seriously lacking and are not well designed to illicit broad applicability. 1) Bekele, E., Lawson, W.

R : More experiments A : Please see our general answer . R : Colormap is not readable . A : We will update it to make it more readable ."}, "2": {"review_id": "S1e-0kBYPB-2", "review_text": "Overview/Contribution: ==================== The authors present a explanation generation framework that help validate post-hoc explanations when the explanations are generated based on feature selection. They claim to demonstrate their method by showing failure modes of exiting explanation generation methods. Overall, the paper is not ready to be accepted to the conference and I describe my rational with the following strengths and weaknesses. Strength: ======== + Explanations make models more transparent and easy to understand for end users of the decision made by complex models such as deep neural networks [1]. In that respect, having a verification mechanism for post-hoc explanations is interesting and useful. + The paper is easy to read and follow. Weakness: =========== - evaluating explanations generated for an opaque model with another opaque model (RCNN) is cyclical. - Just like many literature in this nascent space, interpretation (which is measuring the contribution of features or subsets of features towards predicted output) is confused as explanation. Human level explanations don\u2019t necessarily depend on the direct interaction or contribution of model derived features. Rather they describe \u2018why\u2019 the model come up with the decision produced. - Explanation generation is gaining traction in the deep learning community especially for critical applications such as healthcare and security. However, the authors claim that post-hoc explanations currently are only evaluated for only simple non-neural model. That is misleading given the recent attention toward generating explanations for various deep learning models. - As a generalized pos-hoc explanation generators verification framework, the experiments are seriously lacking and are not well designed to illicit broad applicability. 1) Bekele, E., Lawson, W.

ANSWER : Our general answer should help clarify this . The RCNN is not meant to explain other opaque models , it only explains itself , hence there is no cycle . We only evaluate explainers on the trained RCNNs with their associated pruned datasets for which we provided the guarantees mentioned in the general answer . The RCNN has a degree of transparency that we exploit : it itself , selects the features that it will further exclusively use in the final prediction . Our 2 pruning procedures ensure that , on the instances of the pruned datasets , the RCNN \u2019 s selection faithfully represents the model \u2019 s inner-working : the non-selected tokens are indeed irrelevant and some of the selected tokens are clearly relevant . R : Authors claim that post-hoc explanations currently are only evaluated for simple non-neural model . A : We do not claim that explainers are only evaluated on non-neural models . In the related work , we had listed the 4 types of evaluations we identified in the literature , the last 3 of which are based on complex neural models , but they have other downsides . We have updated the paper to ensure that we mention all 4 types of evaluations together in all parts of the paper . R : More experiments A : Please see general answer . R : Referenced human-level explanation paper A : Thank you for mentioning it , we added it accordingly in the related work ."}}
