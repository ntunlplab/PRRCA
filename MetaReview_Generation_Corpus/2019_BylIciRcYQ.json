A function h is star-convex if its global minimum lies on or above any plane tangent to the function, namely h* >= h(x) + < h'(x), x*-x> for any x. Under such condition, the paper shows that the empirical loss goes to zero and the iterates generated by SGD converges to a global minimum. Extensive experiments has been conducted to empirically validate the assumption. The paper is very well organized and is easy to follow. The star-convexity assumption is very interesting which provides new insights about the landscape of the loss function and the trajectory of SGD. It is in general difficult to theoretically check this condition so several empirical verifications has been proposed. My main concern is about these empirical verifications. 1) The minimum of the cross entropy loss lies at infinity The experiments are performed respect to the cross entropy loss. However, cross entropy loss violates Fact 1 since for any finite weight, cross entropy loss is always strictly positive. Thus the zero is never attained and the global minimum always lies at infinity. As a result, the star-convexity inequality h* >= h(x) + < h'(x), x*-x> hardly makes sense since x* is at infinity and neither does the theorem followed. In this case, a plot of the norm of xk is highly suggested since it is a sanity check to see whether the iterates goes to infinity. 2) The phenomenon may depend on the reference point, i.e last iterate Since the minimum is never attained, the empirical check of the star-convexity maybe biased. More precisely, it might be possible that the behavior of the observed phenomenon depends on the reference point, i.e. the last iterate. Therefore, it will be interesting to see if the observed phenomenon still holds when varying the stopping time, for instance plot the star convexity check using the iterates at 60, 80, 100, 120 epochs as reference point. In fact, the experiments shown in Figure 4 implicitly supports that the behavior may change dramatically respect to different reference point. The reason is that the loss in these experiments are far away from 0, meaning that we are far from the minimum, thus checking the star-convexity does not make sense because the star-convexity is only defined respect to the minimum.

In fact , we verified the star-convexity property for training other losses that by nature can achieve zero such as the MSE loss ( please see the experiment results that we added in Fig.7 in Appendix D in supplementary ) . Under the cross-entropy loss , we found that after the training loss is very close to zero , the l_2 norm of the corresponding iterate grows only logarithmically . This can be clearly seen from the experiments that we added in Fig.6 in Appendix D of supplementary . We further note that such a phenomenon has also been observed and justified in Fig.2 of [ 1 ] ) .

Response : As can be seen in the experiments that we added in Fig.5 in Appendix D of the supplementary materials , we have checked the star-convex property by taking the reference point at different intermediate iterates ( 60 , 80 , 100 , 120 ) as the reviewer suggested . We found that star-convexity still holds under these choices of reference points , and therefore such a property does not depend on the choice of reference point so long as their loss are ( nearly ) zero . This observation is common for over-parameterized networks which can achieve near zero loss and therefore can have common global minimum . We emphasize that the reference point in our star-convexity must be the minimizer that achieves zero loss . Hence , in experiments , we must set the reference point at the epochs where the corresponding loss is nearly zero . The points at intermediate iterates with a high loss value can not be chosen as reference point of star-convexity , because these points can not be treated as the common global minimizer .. Regarding the experiments in Figure 4 , they are conducted on under-parameterized networks where ( approximate ) zero loss can not be achieved , and the algorithm in fact does not find a common global minimum .

Starting from two empirical observations: (1) deep neural networks can almost achieve zero training loss; (2) the path of iterates generated by SGD on these models follow approximately the \u201cstar convex path\u201d, under the assumptions that individual functions share a global minima with respect to which the path of iterates generated by SGD satisfies the star convexity properties, the papers shows that the iterates converges to the global minima. In terms of clarity, I think the paper can definitely benefit if the observations/assumptions/definitions/theorems are stated in a more formal and mathematically rigorous manner. For example: - On page 3, \u201cfact 1\u201d: I don\u2019t think \u201cfact\u201d is the right word here. \u201cFact\u201d refers to what has been rigorously proved or verified, which is not the case for what is in the paper here. I believe \u201cobservation\u201d is more appropriate. Also the assumption that l_i is non-negative should be formally added. - On page 3, section 3.1: the x^* here is the last iteration produced by SGD. Then how can it be called the \u201cglobal minima\u201d? The caption of Figure 1 on page 4 is simply misleading. - On page 4, the statement in definition 1 is more like a theorem than a definition. It is giving readers the impression that any path generated by SGD satisfies the star-convex condition, which is not the case here. A definition should look like \u201cwe call a path generated by SGD a star-convex path if it satisfies \u2026\u201d. Definition 2 on page 6 has the similar issue. In terms of quality, while I believe the paper is technically correct, I have one minor question here: Page 3, Fact 1: How can you conclude that the set of common global minimizers are bounded? In fact I don\u2019t believe this is true at all in general. If you have a ReLu network, you can scale the parameters as described in [1], then the model is invariant. Therefore, the set of common minimizer is definitely NOT bounded. In terms of significance, I think this paper is very interesting as it attempts to draw the connection between the aforementioned observations and the convergence properties of SGD. Unfortunately I think that this paper is less significant than it has appeared to be, although the analysis appears to be correct. First of all, all the analysis of this paper is based on one very important and very strong assumption, namely, all individual functions $l_i$ share at least one common global minimizer. The authors have attempted to justify this assumption by empirical evidences (figure 1). However, achieving near-zero loss is completely different from achieving exact zero because only when the model achieves exact zero can you argue that a common global minimizer exists. Secondly, the claim that the iterate converges to the global minima is based on the assumption that the path follows an \u201cepoch-wise star-convex\u201d property. From this property, it only takes simple convex analysis to reach the conclusion of theorem 1 and 2. Meanwhile, the assumption that the path does follow the \u201cepoch-wise start-convex\u201d properties is not at all informative. It is not clear why or when the path would follow such a path. Therefore theorem 1 and 2 are not more informative than simply assuming the sequence converges to a global minimizer. In fact, it is well-known that SGD with constant stepsize converges to the unique minimizer if one assumes the loss function F is strongly convex and the variance of the stochastic gradient g_k is bounded by a multiple of the norm-square of the true gradient: Var(g_k) <= M ||\u2207F(x_k)||^2 Which is naturally satisfied if all individual functions share a common minimizer. Therefore, I don\u2019t think the results shown in the paper is that surprising or novel. With respect to the empirical evidence, the loss function l_i is assumed to be continuously differentiable with Lipschitz continuous gradients, which is not true for networks using ReLU-like activations. Then how can the paper use models like Alexnet to justify the theory? Also, if what the authors claim is true, then the stochastic gradient would have vanishing variance as it approaches x^*. Can the authors show this empirically? In summary, I think this paper is definitely interesting, but the significance is not as much as it would appear.

Our response to the reviewer \u2019 s comments are provided as follows . Quality : In Fact 1 : How can you conclude that the set of common global minimizers are bounded ? A : We thank the reviewer for pointing out this . In fact , our theoretical results do not require that all the global minima be bounded . To be precise , we only need the star-convexity to hold for a bounded subset of the common global minimum , under which our theory guarantees that SGD converges to one of the elements in that set . We clarify this in the revision . Clarity : On page 3 , \u201c fact \u201d is the right word here . On Page 3 the x^ * here is the last iteration produced by SGD . On page 4 , the statement in definition 1 is more like a theorem . A : We thank the reviewer for valuable suggestions . In the revision , we use `` observation '' instead of \u201c fact \u201d . We add the non-negativity assumption . We now refer to x^ * as the output of SGD . We restate definition 1 & 2 . Significance 1 ) The analysis of this paper is based on ... A : We have added new experiments to demonstrate that for the star-convexity of SGD holds for the MSE loss function ( which can achieve zero loss ) . We agree that cross-entropy achieves only near-zero loss , but such an approximation is not that unreasonable , as can be observed by the experiments that we added as Fig.6 in Appendix D , which illustrates that the cross-entropy loss is nearly zero for certain finite norm of the weight parameters . Hence , we do expect that such approximation can convey useful information . We believe that we should not restrict ourselves only to theory that exactly matches what happens in practice . Near-zero loss is widely observed for training over-parameterized neural networks . Thus , the common minimizer assumption is motivated by this observation , and has led us to discover the star-convexity of SGD paths empirically , and further develop the convergence of SGD based on such a property . Hence , the approximate common global minimizer does yield consistent practical and theoretical results that explain what happens in deep learning . 2 ) Secondly , \u2026 . A : We first want to point out that the \u201c epoch-wise star-convexity \u201d is an accumulative effect of the residual error of every component loss over one epoch , which is a nontrivial and much weaker condition than that the entire loss function is star-convex over the points that SGD visits . Thus , assuming \u201c epoch-wise star-convexity \u201d , the proofs of theorems 1 and 2 do not follow the conventional convex analysis . One can of course argue that it is simple , but we think the focus here should be the information that it conveys in such a context . Second , we report a star-convex path property over a wide range of DL training tasks , which have not been reported in the existing literature to our knowledge . We do think this is an informative discovery . Of course , understanding when and why such a property hold for DL training is definitely important and deserves exploration in the future work . 3 ) In fact , it is well-known that SGD with constant step size \u2026 A : We want to point out the difference between our theory and the result mentioned by the reviewer . The star-convexity is much more relaxed than that the loss function F being strongly convex . Second , the bounded variance assumption that Var ( g_k ) < = M ||\u2207F ( x_k ) ||^2 is hard to justify in general , and it is not clear to what extent can it be justified in DL tasks . Not to mention that it is clearly not true that the loss function is strong convex ! In contrast , our star-convexity assumption is verified by various DL experiments as we report in the paper . Moreover , under strong convexity , traditional analysis only guarantees the convergence of the sequence in probability , which is much weaker than our deterministic convergence results in Theorem 3 . 4 ) With respect to the empirical evidence , ... A : We thank the reviewer for pointing out this , and we are aware of it . We use ReLU activation as it is commonly used in DL tasks . Of course , one can use a smoothed version of ReLU ( softplus ) and obtain nearly the same result . We clarified this and added more experiments on this in the revision . For the variance , we do observe that the variance vanishes as SGD converges , and in fact report such a property as Corollary 1 in the originally submitted version . This is a necessary observation when SGD converges to a common global minimizer , and therefore also justifies the existence of common global minimum to some extent . We add experiments on this in the revision ."}], "0": {"review_id": "BylIciRcYQ-0", "review_text": "This paper analyzed the global convergence property of SGD in deep learning based on the star-convexity assumption.

Sharp minima can generalize for deep nets. arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.04933.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We thank the reviewer for the valuable feedbacks . This paper aims at reporting an interesting star-convex property of the SGD optimization path that has been observed in training a variety of DL models , including MLP , CNN , residual networks and RNN ( verified recently ) . Moreover , our theory is motivated by such a common observation and attempts to justify the role of this property plays in determining the convergence of the optimization in DL . Our response to the reviewer \u2019 s comments are provided as follows . Quality : In Fact 1 : How can you conclude that the set of common global minimizers are bounded ? A : We thank the reviewer for pointing out this . In fact , our theoretical results do not require that all the global minima be bounded . To be precise , we only need the star-convexity to hold for a bounded subset of the common global minimum , under which our theory guarantees that SGD converges to one of the elements in that set . We clarify this in the revision . Clarity : On page 3 , \u201c fact \u201d is the right word here . On Page 3 the x^ * here is the last iteration produced by SGD . On page 4 , the statement in definition 1 is more like a theorem . A : We thank the reviewer for valuable suggestions . In the revision , we use `` observation '' instead of \u201c fact \u201d . We add the non-negativity assumption . We now refer to x^ * as the output of SGD . We restate definition 1 & 2 . Significance 1 ) The analysis of this paper is based on ... A : We have added new experiments to demonstrate that for the star-convexity of SGD holds for the MSE loss function ( which can achieve zero loss ) . We agree that cross-entropy achieves only near-zero loss , but such an approximation is not that unreasonable , as can be observed by the experiments that we added as Fig.6 in Appendix D , which illustrates that the cross-entropy loss is nearly zero for certain finite norm of the weight parameters . Hence , we do expect that such approximation can convey useful information . We believe that we should not restrict ourselves only to theory that exactly matches what happens in practice . Near-zero loss is widely observed for training over-parameterized neural networks . Thus , the common minimizer assumption is motivated by this observation , and has led us to discover the star-convexity of SGD paths empirically , and further develop the convergence of SGD based on such a property . Hence , the approximate common global minimizer does yield consistent practical and theoretical results that explain what happens in deep learning . 2 ) Secondly , \u2026 . A : We first want to point out that the \u201c epoch-wise star-convexity \u201d is an accumulative effect of the residual error of every component loss over one epoch , which is a nontrivial and much weaker condition than that the entire loss function is star-convex over the points that SGD visits . Thus , assuming \u201c epoch-wise star-convexity \u201d , the proofs of theorems 1 and 2 do not follow the conventional convex analysis . One can of course argue that it is simple , but we think the focus here should be the information that it conveys in such a context . Second , we report a star-convex path property over a wide range of DL training tasks , which have not been reported in the existing literature to our knowledge . We do think this is an informative discovery . Of course , understanding when and why such a property hold for DL training is definitely important and deserves exploration in the future work . 3 ) In fact , it is well-known that SGD with constant step size \u2026 A : We want to point out the difference between our theory and the result mentioned by the reviewer . The star-convexity is much more relaxed than that the loss function F being strongly convex . Second , the bounded variance assumption that Var ( g_k ) < = M ||\u2207F ( x_k ) ||^2 is hard to justify in general , and it is not clear to what extent can it be justified in DL tasks . Not to mention that it is clearly not true that the loss function is strong convex ! In contrast , our star-convexity assumption is verified by various DL experiments as we report in the paper . Moreover , under strong convexity , traditional analysis only guarantees the convergence of the sequence in probability , which is much weaker than our deterministic convergence results in Theorem 3 . 4 ) With respect to the empirical evidence , ... A : We thank the reviewer for pointing out this , and we are aware of it . We use ReLU activation as it is commonly used in DL tasks . Of course , one can use a smoothed version of ReLU ( softplus ) and obtain nearly the same result . We clarified this and added more experiments on this in the revision . For the variance , we do observe that the variance vanishes as SGD converges , and in fact report such a property as Corollary 1 in the originally submitted version . This is a necessary observation when SGD converges to a common global minimizer , and therefore also justifies the existence of common global minimum to some extent . We add experiments on this in the revision ."}}
