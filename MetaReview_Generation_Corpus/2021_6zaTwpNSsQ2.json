The authors perform a lot of software simulations to explore the design space on many different models and tasks . Hardware designs have also been synthesized and reported . Pros : - The proposed representation is very general and covers a lot of existing designs , while also allowing for new ones . - An exhaustive exploration of the design space , and the discovery of some new low-precision representations that offer high accuracy as well as computational density . - A lot of different models and datasets are examined . Cons - Some of the main contributions require a more careful , detailed explanation in order to fully appreciate and assess the contribution . - Results are presented in a confusing way . Main areas for improvement : One of the important contributions of the paper seems to be how the minifloat distribution is aligned with the value distribution and how $ \\beta $ is calculated to avoid underflow . However , this topic is only given a couple of sentences of explanation together with Figure 2 , which does not provide much more information . I think the paper would be improved with a precise mathematical explanation of this re-alignment . The block size for sharing exponents is determined semi-analytically by using Equation 6 to find a balance between the area cost and the dynamic range of the resulting numerical representation . However , this equation is introduced rather abruptly . The paper would be improved by providing more explanation of how Equation 6 was derived and some intuition into what the different terms mean . Furthermore , given the authors have implemented the block minifloat scheme in hardware , is it possible to show that Equation 6 actually matches what is seen when synthesizing the design ? The tables in Section 4 , and the corresponding text , need some work . In Table 2 , the footnote ( 2 ) is defined but seems to be unused . In Table 2 , the different columns ( w , x , dw , dx , acc ) are not defined anywhere and it is also not clear what the footnote ( 2 ) means in this context since it applies to the \u2018 acc \u2019 column across all schemes . Additionally , in the corresponding text the authors discuss the performance of BM7 , but this scheme is not found in the table . Additional comments and questions : - In equation ( 1 ) the sign bit $ s $ is defined before the equation , but exponent $ E $ and mantissa $ F $ are not defined until the sentence afterwards . - In equation ( 2 ) it is not immediately clear what the index $ i $ is meant to indicate . Furthermore , $ X_i^a $ seems to indicate that the definition of $ a $ depends on itself . - Aside from using minifloats , how does this work compare to Flexpoint [ 1 ] , which takes a similar approach to shared exponents ? - In Figure 6 \u2013 are the accuracy measurements actually taken from the hardware simulation ?

We have uploaded a revised draft with more information and improved clarity based on suggestions and feedback received . Below , we provide answers and responses to specific questions and issues raised . # 1. \u201c alignment of minifloat distribution and value distribution requires more precise explanation \u201d . This is indeed an important aspect of our work . In block minifloat , the shared exponent bias is calculated to align the minifloat distribution with the maximim exponent in the value distribution . The idea is to avoid overflow , which contributes the largest errors in dot-product computations . We have added Equation 3 in the revised draft to formalize this key step . # 2. \u201c Equation 6 requires more explanation \u201d . This issue was also raised by Reviewer 2 and has been addressed in the revised draft , by Equation 7 now . The question remains how Equation 7 can be shown to match an implemented design . This is possible by defining the resource costs for each overhead ( given by $ \\alpha $ in the text ) using actual synthesized area results . For example , $ \\alpha_ { 1 } $ would be equal to the area for BM multiply-add , and $ \\alpha_ { 2 } $ would be the area of the floating-point hardware ( which also includes the BM quantization and conversion modules ) . Since only $ \\alpha_ { 1 } $ has been synthesized we can not use Equation 7 in a useful sense . Furthermore , Equation 7 is not designed to provide very accurate resource/area estimates since RTL synthesis tools are typically difficult to model . Rather , Equation 7 is expected to guide the choice of N , by capturing the main trend . # 3. \u201c Experiments and results are confusing \u201d . This has been updated in the revised draft with appropriate definitions given for columns of the numerical representation ( i.e.w , x , dw , dx ) . Additionally , BM7 has been added to the main results table from the Appendix . # 4. \u201c Notation issue with block minifloat definitions \u201d . The original notation was indeed wrong . We have redefined $ X_ { i } ^ { a } $ to hopefully clear this up . # 5.Flexpoint refers to a 16-bit block floating-point format with a 5-bit shared exponent . Block minifloats are considerably smaller , between 4 and 8 bits with an 8 bit shared exponent , and use minifloat rather than fixed-point as the underlying block representation . In terms of how the shared exponent is updated , Flexpoint proposes an algorithm called Autoflex to predict the output exponent , from a history of maximum exponents , and use the prediction to preemptively increase the exponent to avoid overflows . Our exponent update scheme is simpler and is calculated by the maximum exponent at that current point in training . # 6.We simulate the behaviour of BM hardware using GPUs and Pytorch . Therefore , the accuracy is taken from ImageNet experiments running on the GPU . Our RTL code is only capable of simulating the BM dot-products , not the entire system ."}, {"review_id": "6zaTwpNSsQ2-1", "review_text": "The authors proposes block-minifloat ( BM ) , a floating-point format for DNN training . BM is a fairly simple extension to block floating-point ( BFP ) , which was proposed in ( Drumond 2018 and Yang 2019 ) . In BFP , a block of integer mantissas share a single exponent . In BM , a block of narrow floats share a single exponent bias . The shared exponent bias helps to shorten the exponent field on each individual float element . This is a good contribution , though a bit trivial . Where the paper make a strong contribution is in the hardware implementation of BM , something which neither Drumond or Yang really got into . The authors propose to use a Kulisch accumulator for minifloat dot products , which basically works by converting the floats to integers with a shift , and accumulating with a very wide register . Kulisch accumulators are normally far too wide to be practical ( see Eq.4 ) , but they 've been proposed for posit computation ( https : //engineering.fb.com/2018/11/08/ai-research/floating-point-math/ ) . This seem like a great idea here since BM can reduce the exponent length to only 2 or 3 bits . The authors also did a good job evaluating the area and power of the BM hardware circuit . They built a 4x4 systolic array multiplier using BM units in RTL , and synthesized to place and route . The results show that BM6 can be 4x smaller and use 2.3x less power than FP8 while achieving to comparable accuracy . This is a pretty impressive result , and the hardware evaluation methodology is more stringent than most quantization papers at NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR . The only * * minor * * issue I have here is the area/power numbers are reported for BM8/BM6 , but the exact config is not specified . E.g.is BM8 referring to ( 2e , 5m ) ? The accuracy comparison is pretty standard , with CIFAR and ImageNet results using mostly ResNet-18 . The authors ' simulation framework slows training by 5x , so this is as much as I would expect . One * * major * * issue is that Tables 1 and 3 shows that for training to succeed , the forward and backwards BM formats must be different . Table 3 has three separate BM formats for each row . Implementing them all in hardware could incur significant overhead , which the paper does n't discuss . The authors mention that the HFP8 paper does the same - but that paper defends this practice by showing that their two formats ( which only differ by 1 e/m bit ) can be supported by a single FP unit with minimal overhead . This paper uses ( 2e,5m ) , ( 4e,3m ) and ( 6e,9m ) in the same experiment labeled `` BM8 '' , which seems both misleading and unjustified . Note that SWALP and S2FP8 ( and bfloat16/float16 papers ) would use the same format in forwards and backwards pass and avoid this overhead . A few other insights : ( 1 ) subnormal floats are important and ca n't just be flushed to zero ; ( 2 ) a square BM block size of 48x48 seems to work fine . Minor issues : - The methodology for hardware area seem solid ( Appendix 4 ) , but there is n't much detail on power . Was power obtained through modeling or using an RTL simulator ? What kind of test vectors were used ? - The area/power numbers are given for `` BM8 '' , but what 's the precise format ? I assumed it was ( 2 , 5 ) . - The introduction of log-BM seems very sudden , and they 're only used for VGG-16 ? Did regular BM5 not work ? I 'm not sure what to take away from the comparison in Table 2 . - Equation 6 was a bit confusing for me . It would be helpful to explain briefly how each term was derived . - Training in BM requires you to update the exponent biases in each step ( ? ) , which requires computing the dynamic range of each $ N \\times N $ block . I believe this is probably negligible , but it should be discussed as an additional overhead .

Below , we provide answers and responses to specific questions and issues raised . 1. \u201c minor issue about the specification of the BM configuration \u201d . All BM formats are hybrid , meaning two formats are specified . BM8 always refers to ( 2,5 ) / ( 4,3 ) , like BM6 always refers to ( 2,3 ) / ( 3,2 ) . We \u2019 ve tried to clear this up in the text in \u201c Section 3 , Training with Block Minifloat , Hybrid representation \u201d . 2. \u201c major issue about three BM formats and associated overhead of the arithmetic unit \u201d . Firstly , the ( 6e , 9 ) format is only applied to the weight gradients which does not require matrix multiplication . This means that the ( 6e , 9 ) does not involve computations mapped to block minifloat hardware ( which is focused on dot-products in the GEMM ) . The issue now relates to the overhead for supporting ( 2e,5 ) and ( 4e,3 ) formats together , which have 2-bits mismatched . This primarily affects the mantissa multiplier , which must be large enough for the two largest mantissa operands . Put another way , the mantissa multiplier is not 5x3 , rather it must support 5x5 ( i.e.for weight * activation in forward path ) . Importantly , this has already been factored into our hardware as well as synthesis results . For some more clarity , Table 9 ( original draft ) or Table 11 ( revised draft ) provides component breakdowns of the logic area for ( 2e,5 ) / ( 4e,3 ) format and specify a 6x6 mantissa multiply . 6x6 instead of 5x5 because of the implicit bit which is added for supporting denormal numbers . We hope our explanation has cleared up this issue . 3. \u201c issue about power modelling \u201d . The power comes from the Cadence RTL Compiler . It 's important to note that these numbers are only rough estimates . 4. log-BM was included because we wanted to show that block minifloats cover the spectrum of formats between fixed-point and log representations at the corner cases . We compared VGG-16 with ( Miyashita et al.2016 ) since this is our only known example of logarithmic training . We haven \u2019 t tested BM5 or BM4 on VGG16 , though we do expect similar if not better results than log-BM5 and log-BM4 . This could be an interesting comparison point if we do in fact achieve better results ( all be it on an outdated network ) . We have not had an opportunity to include this in our revised draft , but will consider the merits of this for any subsequent revision . 5. \u201c issue about confusing Equation 6 \u201d .

This new representation combines FP8 formats and the shared exponent bias concept to cover the dynamic range of tensors needed for DNN training .

However , as a key contribution of this work , the authors did not give enough information and details on why \u201c exponents up to 4 bits offer distinct advantages \u201d for Kulishch accumulation . Could the authors explain more on the accumulator and provide some evident why smaller exponent is critical ? 2 ) .From emulation point of view , the authors use existing CUDA libraries for GEMM which basically uses standard FP32 floating point accumulation . When the authors use certain bit-width for Kulish accumulator elements ( for e.g.Table 9 and Table 10 ) , how do you know this accumulator setting won \u2019 t impact model convergence ? 3 ) .Hardware overhead for denorm support : the exponent bias is only guard against overflow , so denorm numbers are used to cover the range of smaller numbers . The authors claim that the hardware overhead is minimum since only input multiplicands are needed for the detection of denorm . However , there should be additional complexity than that . For example , how to handle denorm numbers in addend and how to tell the result produced is norm or denorm ? Could the authors describe the hardware that needed to convert numbers from an intermediate format or a floating point format to their BM format ? 4 ) .For experiment , it would have been good to include some larger networks , such as ResNet50 on ImageNet to compared to SOTA .", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We would like to thank the reviewer for their valuable feedback and comments . We have uploaded a revised draft with more information and improved clarity based on suggestions and feedback received . Below , we provide answers and responses to specific questions and issues raised . # 1.The main reason for \u201c up to 4-bit exponents \u201d is because in these regimes block minifloat representations ( with Kulisch accumulation ) have INT8-like hardware complexity ( i.e.8-bit multiply and 32-bit accumulate ) . INT8 is important because it represents the most efficient arithmetic scheme capable of training tasks like ImageNet to an accuracy that is close to FP32 . Put another way , the Kulisch accumulator is prohibitively wide and expensive for formats with larger exponents . This becomes clear when comparing kadd for different formats , but more importantly , it is supported by our hardware synthesis results of different formats . We have updated \u201c Section 2.3 Kulisch Accumulation \u201d in the revised draft with a similar explanation . Also , we have included Table 11 in the Appendix which provides a better comparison for kadd and related area costs . # 2.The Kulisch accumulator is always sized to calculate an error free sum of products . On the otherhand , FP32 accumulators may produce small rounding errors when adding very large and small numbers together . In such cases , the accumulator may not have enough mantissa bits ( i.e.23 in FP32 ) to tolerate large right shifts . Given that most DNNs train successfully with FP32 accumulation , it is reasonable to assume that FP32 is a very close approximation to an error-free Kulisch accumulator . # 3 . `` issue regarding denormal overheads '' . In our estimation , the hardware overhead for supporting denormal numbers is small . Only one extra bit ( i.e.the implicit bit ) must be incorporated into each mantissa for multiplication . This does incur some overhead , though the resultant arithmetic units are typically still very small . We cite our synthesis results to support this claim . Furthermore , there is no additional complexity in the addend or result of the MAC unit because these are represented in fixed point . To determine whether a partial sum ( for a given dot product ) is norm or denorm , the value must be converted to a floating point representation , using standard fixed to float conversion hardware , where the number will be denorm if the floating-point exponent encoding is 0 ( as in Equation 1 ) . # 3.Conversion from fixed point to floating-point ( and subsequently Block Minifloat ) involves the following steps . 1 . ) A leading-one detection module is required to determine the position of the most significant bit , 2 . ) the fixed point number must be shifted so the decimal point is at the most significant bit , 3 . ) the position ( which is a bit index and location of decimal point ) should be compared to the representable range of the floating point or minifloat format . This involves conditional logic to determine whether the number should be saturated , flushed-to-zero , denorm or norm . 4 . ) A denorm number exists if the position is equal to the minimum exponent in the minifloat format ( after the bias applied ) . In such cases , the decimal point must be left shifted by one more bit , 5 . ) The last step involves quantization of the fractional bits ( or mantissa ) using stochastic rounding . This can be implemented with a multiplier and linear feedback shift register ( LFSR ) . We have provided a little bit of context to this description in \u201c Section 5 Hardware Evaluation \u201d of the revised draft . This is to supplement the main analysis of block minifloat arithmetic units . 4 . ) This was the plan . We started ResNet50 , but the training time proved to be a bottleneck for effective testing and exploration . We instead focused on smaller networks that we feel are more suitable to the targeted embedded domain anyway , where stricter computational power and area constraints exist ."}], "0": {"review_id": "6zaTwpNSsQ2-0", "review_text": "This paper proposes a family of numerical representations for training neural networks based on minifloats that share a common exponent across blocks .

What interesting is that the author uses this method to push for smaller exponent bits which in turn allows a more efficient accumulator . However , as a key contribution of this work , the authors did not give enough information and details on why \u201c exponents up to 4 bits offer distinct advantages \u201d for Kulishch accumulation . Could the authors explain more on the accumulator and provide some evident why smaller exponent is critical ? 2 ) .From emulation point of view , the authors use existing CUDA libraries for GEMM which basically uses standard FP32 floating point accumulation . When the authors use certain bit-width for Kulish accumulator elements ( for e.g.Table 9 and Table 10 ) , how do you know this accumulator setting won \u2019 t impact model convergence ? 3 ) .Hardware overhead for denorm support : the exponent bias is only guard against overflow , so denorm numbers are used to cover the range of smaller numbers . The authors claim that the hardware overhead is minimum since only input multiplicands are needed for the detection of denorm . However , there should be additional complexity than that . For example , how to handle denorm numbers in addend and how to tell the result produced is norm or denorm ? Could the authors describe the hardware that needed to convert numbers from an intermediate format or a floating point format to their BM format ? 4 ) .For experiment , it would have been good to include some larger networks , such as ResNet50 on ImageNet to compared to SOTA .", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We would like to thank the reviewer for their valuable feedback and comments . We have uploaded a revised draft with more information and improved clarity based on suggestions and feedback received . Below , we provide answers and responses to specific questions and issues raised . # 1.The main reason for \u201c up to 4-bit exponents \u201d is because in these regimes block minifloat representations ( with Kulisch accumulation ) have INT8-like hardware complexity ( i.e.8-bit multiply and 32-bit accumulate ) . INT8 is important because it represents the most efficient arithmetic scheme capable of training tasks like ImageNet to an accuracy that is close to FP32 . Put another way , the Kulisch accumulator is prohibitively wide and expensive for formats with larger exponents . This becomes clear when comparing kadd for different formats , but more importantly , it is supported by our hardware synthesis results of different formats . We have updated \u201c Section 2.3 Kulisch Accumulation \u201d in the revised draft with a similar explanation . Also , we have included Table 11 in the Appendix which provides a better comparison for kadd and related area costs . # 2.The Kulisch accumulator is always sized to calculate an error free sum of products . On the otherhand , FP32 accumulators may produce small rounding errors when adding very large and small numbers together . In such cases , the accumulator may not have enough mantissa bits ( i.e.23 in FP32 ) to tolerate large right shifts . Given that most DNNs train successfully with FP32 accumulation , it is reasonable to assume that FP32 is a very close approximation to an error-free Kulisch accumulator . # 3 . `` issue regarding denormal overheads '' . In our estimation , the hardware overhead for supporting denormal numbers is small . Only one extra bit ( i.e.the implicit bit ) must be incorporated into each mantissa for multiplication . This does incur some overhead , though the resultant arithmetic units are typically still very small . We cite our synthesis results to support this claim . Furthermore , there is no additional complexity in the addend or result of the MAC unit because these are represented in fixed point . To determine whether a partial sum ( for a given dot product ) is norm or denorm , the value must be converted to a floating point representation , using standard fixed to float conversion hardware , where the number will be denorm if the floating-point exponent encoding is 0 ( as in Equation 1 ) . # 3.Conversion from fixed point to floating-point ( and subsequently Block Minifloat ) involves the following steps . 1 . ) A leading-one detection module is required to determine the position of the most significant bit , 2 . ) the fixed point number must be shifted so the decimal point is at the most significant bit , 3 . ) the position ( which is a bit index and location of decimal point ) should be compared to the representable range of the floating point or minifloat format . This involves conditional logic to determine whether the number should be saturated , flushed-to-zero , denorm or norm . 4 . ) A denorm number exists if the position is equal to the minimum exponent in the minifloat format ( after the bias applied ) . In such cases , the decimal point must be left shifted by one more bit , 5 . ) The last step involves quantization of the fractional bits ( or mantissa ) using stochastic rounding . This can be implemented with a multiplier and linear feedback shift register ( LFSR ) . We have provided a little bit of context to this description in \u201c Section 5 Hardware Evaluation \u201d of the revised draft . This is to supplement the main analysis of block minifloat arithmetic units . 4 . ) This was the plan . We started ResNet50 , but the training time proved to be a bottleneck for effective testing and exploration . We instead focused on smaller networks that we feel are more suitable to the targeted embedded domain anyway , where stricter computational power and area constraints exist ."}}
