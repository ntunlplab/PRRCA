The paper does a series of empirical studies on this topic. Among other things the authors observe that larger models can increase the number latent variables recovered when fitting larger variational inference models. The reviewers raised some concern about the simplicity of the models studied and also lack of some theoretical justification. One reviewer also suggests that more experiments and ablation studies on more general models will further help clarify the role over-parameterized model for latent generative models. I agree with the reviewers that this paper is \"compelling reason for theoretical research on the interplay between overparameterization and parameter recovery in latent variable neural networks trained with gradient descent methods\". I disagree with the reviewers that theoretical study is required as I think a good empirical paper with clear conjectures is as important. I do agree with the reviewers however that for empirical paper I think the empirical studies would have to be a bit more thorough with more clear conjectures. In summary, I think the paper is nice and raises a lot of interesting questions but can be improved with more through studies and conjectures. I would have liked to have the paper accepted but based on the reviewer scores and other papers in my batch I can not recommend acceptance at this time. I strongly recommend the authors to revise and resubmit. I really think this is a nice paper and has a lot of potential and can have impact with appropriate revision.", "reviews": [{"review_id": "rkg0_eHtDr-0", "review_text": "This paper performs empirical study on the influence of overparameterization to generalization performance of noisy-or networks and sparse coding, and points out overparameterization is indeed beneficial. I find the paper has some drawbacks. 1. Overparameterization is better than underparamterization and exact parameterization is not surprising. The question is how much do we need to overparameterize. As the number of parameters goes to infinity, the model can eventually remember all the training data, and has poor generalization. The real interesting question to ask is how to use an excessive amount of parameters, yet still avoid overfitting. 2. The discussed models are too simple. I am expecting some theoretical analysis for tasks simple as noisy-or and sparse coding, or some experiments for more complicated (deep) models need to be done, to make the paper more solid. Update ===== Thank the authors for the response. The authors do address my comment #1. I agree that overparameterization improves recovery is a new finding. However, I still think the \"information gain\" of this paper is somewhat thin. There could be at least some intuitions on why overparameterization helps noisy-or models. I think the analysis can be more in-depth to make this paper more interesting. I would like to raise my score a bit to a \"neutral\" score, but given the current scoring system I'll just keep my score. ", "rating": "3: Weak Reject", "reply_text": "Thank you for your comments ! Regarding ( 1 ) , the rationale of the reviewer applies to the * likelihood * of the model we fit : the training-set likelihood should improve , and there is a potential that the test likelihood will drop ( i.e.memorization happens ) . Our paper * does not * focus on this -- it focuses on * parameter recovery * -- here , it is entirely unclear why overparametrization should help , as there can be potentially many overparametrized models with equally good likelihood , but no relation to the ground truth parameters of the model whatsoever . This isn \u2019 t an issue of memorization -- rather in the presence of overparametrization , the model could in principle be un-identifiable ( i.e.multiple sets of parameters give rise to the same distribution ) , so there is no a-priori reason why the optimization should prefer the ground truth parameters . Moreover , in our noisy-OR experiments , 128 latent variables are already 16 times more than the true number of latent variables , and at this level of overparameterization the performance is still much better than without overparameterization . Hence , we show that if there is a \u201c critical \u201d amount of overparametrization at which performance starts to suffer , it may be quite large . Regarding ( 2 ) : while it would be great to have theory accompanying our empirical observations , we note that theoretical analysis for our settings is likely to be very non-trivial given our current understanding of the optimization for these latent-variable models . For noisy-OR networks , the currently known algorithms with provable guarantees use tensor-based techniques and are very different from the gradient-descent algorithm used by us ( e.g.see [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] ) . For sparse coding , the currently known results about gradient-descent like algorithms assume incoherence of the ground truth matrix , as well as the * iterates * of the algorithm ( e.g.see [ 3 ] and [ 4 ] ) . It is clear that the iterates will not be incoherent in our setup due to the existence of near-duplicates -- so such techniques seem difficult to generalize . We agree that a study of deep generative models would be very interesting , but we see this work as a necessary prerequisite . By focusing on the simplest linear ( sparse coding ) and non-linear ( noisy-OR ) models in which the beneficial effect of overparameterization manifests , it allowed us to determine precisely how variations in the parameters of the ground-truth model and algorithms affect it .

The problem itself is just a sparse coding problem. Hence, I think what investigated in this paper can be discussed by relating sparse coding theories.
