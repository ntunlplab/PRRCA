By leveraging the monotone operator theory , the authors propose to use the forward-backward-forward method so as to avoids the notorious limit cycling problem .

In the setting of convex-concave minimax optimization , the authors claim to prove novel convergence rates for both methods . Review : This paper is well-written , though I think the difference with extra-gradient can be made much clearer . For example , the authors could compare FBF with EG for a toy example like Eqn .

The difference between the two methods is not so much the regularization term ( which is part of the objective function ) but how it is treated : per iteration EG requires two evaluations of the projection ( prox ) corresponding to the regularizer , while FBF only needs one .

In the current version of the paper , section 2.4 is vague and does n't explain the role of regularizers well in GAN training .

Since OGDA , EG and FBF are similar they naturally rely on similar proof techniques . Through our unified approach it becomes easier to draw a distinction between and highlight the similarities of OGDA and FBF . Because of this we are able to pinpoint where the different stepsize requirements arise ( OGDA only allows for half as big of a stepsize compared to FBF , and thus possibly negate every saving stemming from the reduced amount of gradient evaluations .. ) . In particular , it indicates why OGDA tends to requires a smaller stepsize than FBF/EG in applications . > It was shown in [ 2 ] that extra-gradient is NOT robust to gradient noise in convex-concave minimax optimization . Could the authors comment on that and explain why FBF could achieve the rate of $ O ( 1/sqrt ( k ) ) $ in the stochastic setting ( while EG fails ) ? Reference [ 2 ] itself mentions that EG exhibits the same $ O ( 1/\\sqrt { k } ) $ rate , see Table 1 in that paper . These two seemingly conflicting statements stem in our opinion from the fact that one is with respect to the sequence of ( last ) iterates itself and the other one is in terms of the ergodic ( averaged ) ones . The mentioned issue is of course relevant and a version of FBF which is robust to noise would be interesting . > Is it possible to derive the last iterate convergence rate ?

The gap function used can in fact be traced back to Facchinei & Pang ( 2003 ) and is most likely even longer in use than that .", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "Dear reviewer , thank you for your time and interest .

Since monotone inclusions are not a well known object in the ML community we wanted to make sure that the concept is properly motivated . > preceded by a long and unnecessary discussion about existing solvers Due to the similarities of the existing methods we think that this exposition is necessary in order to not create confusion . First of all it seems very natural to us to compare FBF with EG since the two methods are so closely related . Secondly , by recycling previous gradients we provide a novel intuition for OGDA/FRB , which we think is relevant and requires us to mention said methods . > p.3 claim that FBF has not been rigorously analyzed for saddle point problems . This is of course not true . We meant , but did not write explicitly , this statement to be in terms of function values / gap . We added this clarifying specification in the pdf on page 3 . At the same time we would like to point out that in the contribution paragraph and in the conclusion this was already stated more precisely before . > The stochastic FBF has been studied in [ ... ] We added the reference and clarified the differences with the mentioned paper . In particular , the cited article does not deal with the minimax setting specifically and is therefore not able to make statements about the gap function . > For SFBF we know non-asymptotic convergence rates of the last iterate . This is not mentioned at all . Thank you for pointing this out . We mentioned this in the updated version of our preprint and clarified that these rates are in terms of fixed point residual , which is a rather general notion and does not exploit the special structure of the problem . Another key difference between our work and the mentioned paper is that we do not rely on minibatch sizes that go to infinity . > if the aim is to solve the VI over an unconstrained domain , then FBF coincides with EG [ ... ] In my opinion it would therefore be cleaner to assume at the outset that the domain of $ F+\\partial r $ is bounded We do not see a convincing reason to assume that the domain of the problem is bounded . In fact there are many interesting regularizers which do not have a bounded domain . Note further that EG and FBF are not the same method in this regularized ( but unconstrained ) setting ."}, "3": {"review_id": "Yj4mmVB_l6-3", "review_text": "In this paper , the authors first formulate the optimization problem of GANs as an abstract minimax problem ( Equation ( 1 ) ) . As compared to the original optimization objective of Goodfellow 's GANs , there is an additional term $ h ( y ) $ . Why do you introduce $ h ( y ) $ here ? Just for facilitating the adoption of the MONOTONE INCLUSIONS on it ? The authors should provide a clear explanation about this point . Later the author restrict Equation ( 1 ) to a deterministic version , which means that the noise input of GANs will no longer be considered . The noise input is an important ingredient of GANs . Despite many new variants of the GANs , at least , the noise input is import for the Goodfellow 's GANs , which is adopted in this submission as a staring point . It is very hard for me to decide whether this simplification is appropriate . Except Algorithm 3.2 and Theorem 3.2 which suddenly provide stochastic versions , all the following results are on this deterministic version . In my opinion , the authors should provide more explanations on this point . I can not understand the first sentence of Section 2.2 , after read it many times . What is the exact necessary and sufficient optimality condition for the coupling function being convex-concave and differentiable ? Before Equation ( 2 ) , the authors did n't explain what is monotone and what is monotone inclusion . I do n't think these concepts are very famous in machine learning community . In Section 2.3 , the authors provided the introduction of lots of iterative methods . It is difficult for me to distinguish which are completely new findings for solving their inclusion problem and which are the existing results . The authors completed a literature review here . In Section 2.4 , I do n't know why the problem ( 1 ) can be written as Equation ( 8 ) . Could you provide more explanations about this point ? Limited space of one submission should be on important points . In Section 3 , could you explain more about why $ G_B ( w ) $ in Equation ( 10 ) is defined as this form ? Just for facilitating the proof of Theorem 3.1 and Theorem 3.2 ? In Section 3.2 , the authors provided a generalized FBF algorithm . Is n't this Algorithm 3.1 a combined re-written version of Equation ( 4 ) and Equation ( 5 ) ? There is a big gap between Equation ( 9 ) , Theorem 3.1 and Theorem 3.2 and the experimental results shown in Section 4 . Besides , there are no open source codes provided . It is very hard for me to figure out the details of the experiments and meantime to check the reproducibility of this paper . Although , the authors stated that `` Due to the theoretical nature of this work , the aim of this section is not to achieve new state-of-the-art results . '' I do n't think optimization is a theoretical branch of our machine learning community . If a proposed optimization method can not be proved to be very useful in certain ares or specific tasks , it will be very doubting . If we intend to do theoretical contributions , we should try to prove the theoretical properties or convergence bounds for the existing useful optimization methods . Since ICLR is a highly selective conference , the originality and significance of one submission will always be in the first priority .

For your convenience we highlighted all the changes in the pdf in red . > Why do you introduce h ( y ) here ? The functions $ h $ and $ f $ here act as regularizers . These could reflect the box constraints in the case of weight clipping or the spectral normalization in the case of SN-GANs . We added an explanatory remark in Section 2.4 of the manuscript . These functions are mentioned explicitly and treated separately in the algorithms because of their potential nonsmoothness . > Later the author restrict Equation ( 1 ) to a deterministic version We restrict to the deterministic version only in the introductory Section 2 . We try to differentiate between the stochastic and the deterministic setting not via the expectation in the objective function but whether stochastic or batch gradient updates are used . This was done purely for ease of notation in order to not having to write the expected value whenever the objective function appears . We tried to clarify this in the manuscript right below eqn ( 1 ) . > I can not understand the first sentence of Section 2.2 . > I do n't know why the problem ( 1 ) can be written as Equation ( 8 ) What we meant was that the monotone inclusion corresponds to the first order optimality condition of our main problem . In general finding a first order critical point stipulates a necessary condition for being a local solution . Due to the assumed convexity of the problem every critical point is indeed a solution . Thus , solving the ( monotone ) inclusion is equivalent to solving the minimax problem and finding a saddle point . We clarified this point in the updated version . > the authors provided [ ... ] lots of iterative methods . It is difficult for me to distinguish which are completely new We rephrased this section slightly in order to highlight the origin of the different methods . > could you explain more about why $ G_B ( w ) $ in Equation ( 10 ) is defined as this form ? We added a game theoretic interpretation of the minimax gap . In short it corresponds to the payoff each player can achieve by choosing the best response given the ( suboptimal ) strategy of their opponent . A set of strategies thus corresponds to a small gap if only a small payoff can be achieved for either player by playing the best strategy given the current one . > In Section 3.2 , the authors provided a generalized FBF algorithm . Is n't this Algorithm 3.1 a combined re-written version of Equation ( 4 ) and Equation ( 5 ) ? Indeed.It is a template in order to reconstruct these two methods and thus highlights how they are connected . > There is a big gap between Equation ( 9 ) [ ... ] and the experimental results In Section 2.2 we tried to make the connection between monotone inclusions and minimax problems clear . If it helps we can explicitly write down our methods for saddle point problems ( which includes the training of GANs ) in the Appendix . > there are no open source codes provided These should be present in the supplementary material .
