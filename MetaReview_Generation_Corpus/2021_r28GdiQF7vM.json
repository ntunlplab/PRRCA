The authors may want to complete the proof to Theorem A.1 or point out some relevant references about that . * * \\ * * A : * * Yes , you are right . We need Theorem A.1 to translate previous bounds in the comparison . We agree it is important to either prove or give the exact reference to these crucial results . The proof of Part ( a ) can be found in Hardt et al. , ( 2016 , Theorem 2.2 ) . Part ( b ) was first proved for deterministic algorithms ( Bousquet \\ & Elisseeff 2002 , Theorem 11 ) , and then extended to randomized algorithms ( Elisseeff et al.2005 , Theorem 12 ) . We have added these references in the proof of Theorem A.1 . * * Q : $ L , \\beta $ in Assumptions 1 , 2 are parameters about $ F $ , while $ \\Sigma_S $ depends on random $ S $ in Examples 1 , 2 . Shall we need some more assumptions about the data distribution ? * * \\ * * A : * * Sorry for the confusion . The parameter $ L $ reflects the smoothness of individual loss functions , while $ \\sigma_ { \\text { max } } ( \\Sigma_S ) $ is related to the smoothness of $ F_S $ . In our discussion of examples , we assume $ L $ and $ \\sigma_ { \\text { max } } ( \\Sigma_S ) $ are of the same order ( Appendix E ) . Note $ L $ can be small in practice , e.g. , least square loss and logistic loss . For the PL condition , the parameter $ \\beta $ is more related to $ F_S $ instead of $ F $ since Assumption 2 involves the term $ \\inf_ { \\mathbf { w } } F_S ( \\mathbf { w } ) $ and $ \\|\\nabla F_S ( \\mathbf { w } ) \\|_2^2 $ . We take an expectation w.r.t. $ S $ in Assumption 2 since we only study generalization bounds in expectation . In Examples 1 , 2 , we show that the gradient-dominance parameter of $ F_S $ is related to $ \\sigma_ { \\text { min } } ( \\Sigma_S ) $ . We have modified these examples by replacing `` $ L/\\beta $ is of the order of '' with `` the empirical counterpart of $ L/\\beta $ is of the order of '' to avoid the confusion . Our analysis does not require more assumptions on the data distribution . Indeed , our bounds are distribution-free . * * Q : $ O ( 1/ ( n\\beta ) ) $ is standard if $ F $ is convex . Does the gap still hold under other nonconvex relaxing conditions such as one-point strongly convexity or quadratic growth ? * * \\ * * A : * * Firstly , we would like to clarify that convexity is not sufficient to guarantee the generalization gap $ O ( 1/ ( n\\beta ) ) $ . An additional assumption like strong convexity is needed for the $ O ( 1/ ( n\\beta ) ) $ generalization gap . The $ O ( 1/ ( n\\beta ) ) $ gap also holds under the one-point strong convexity assumption . Indeed , one-point strong convexity and smoothness imply the PL condition ( Yuan et al. , 2019 , Lemma 2 ) . Therefore , all our results apply to one-point strongly convex functions . For functions satisfying the quadratic growth condition ( Necoara et al. , 2019 ) , we need another realizability assumption to enjoy generalization . We have added new generalization bounds in Theorem 3 on the quadratic growth condition . Note that the realizability condition is also required in Charles \\ & Papailiopoulos ( 2018 ) to study the generalization gap for functions satisfying the quadratic growth condition ."}, {"review_id": "r28GdiQF7vM-1", "review_text": "This paper mainly studies the generalization performance of stochastic algorithms .

In this revision , we group the discussions according to stability measures . We first discuss the related work on uniform stability . Then we move onto several other stability measures . Finally , we emphasize the on-average stability by indicating its advantage in exploiting either the strong convexity or the relaxed exp-concavity in the existing analysis . This motivates us to use the on-average stability for learning with the PL condition , which is another relaxed condition of strong convexity . We have separated the related work on generalization analysis in two paragraphs . The first paragraph is on the stability approach , and the second paragraph sketches some other approaches . In the end of the first paragraph , we put more discussions on the most related work ( Charles \\ & Papailiopoulos , 2018 ) by presenting some defects . We explain that these defects are due to the use of pointwise hypothesis stability and the ignorance of smoothness property , which motivate us to refine their results by considering the weaker on-average stability and exploiting the smoothness of loss functions . Please see Section 2 for details . * * Q : How widely is the PL condition applicable ? Are there any examples when the PL condition does not hold ? * * \\ * * A : * * PL condition is widely used in the non-convex learning setting ( Zhou et al. , 2018b ; Reddi et al. , 2016 ; Karimi et al. , 2016 ; Wang et al. , 2019 ; Lei et al. , 2017 , Charles \\ & Papailiopoulos , 2018 ; Yuan et al. , 2019 ) . It is shown to hold for strongly convex functions composed with piecewise-linear objectives ( Karimi et al. , 2016 , Charles \\ & Papailiopoulos , 2018 ) , and non-convex learning problems including generalized linear models , robust regression ( Foster et al. , 2019 ) and linear neural networks ( Charles \\ & Papailiopoulos , 2018 , Hardt \\ & Ma , 2016 ) . PL condition can fail for very simple functions . For example , consider the one-dimensional function $ f ( x ) =x^4 $ . Then $ f ' ( x ) =4x^3 $ and the minimal value is $ 0 $ . Furthermore , we have $ $ \\frac { f ( x ) -0 } { |f ' ( x ) |^2 } =\\frac { x^4 } { 16x^6 } =\\frac { 1 } { 16x^2 } \\to\\infty\\text { as } x\\to0 . $ $ Therefore , the PL condition does not hold . * * Q : The difference between the condition $ L\\leq n\\beta/4 $ and $ L < n\\beta/2 $ . * * \\ * * A : * * Under the condition $ L < n\\beta/2 $ , our analysis in the proof of Theorem 1 can actually imply the bound $ $ \\mathbb { E } \\big [ F ( \\mathbf { w } _S ) - \\hat { F } _S\\big ] \\leq \\frac { 8L\\mathbb { E } [ \\hat { F } _S ] } { n\\beta-2L } + \\frac { L\\mathbb { E } \\big [ F_S ( \\mathbf { w } _S ) -\\hat { F } _S\\big ] } { 2\\beta } . $ $ This implies the bound in Theorem 1 by taking a further assumption $ L\\leq n\\beta/4 $ . In Corollary 2 , we assume $ \\mathbb { E } [ \\hat { F } _S ] =0 $ and therefore we can get $ \\frac { 8L\\mathbb { E } [ \\hat { F } _S ] } { n\\beta-2L } =0 $ under the condition $ L < n\\beta/2 $ . We have added a note below the proof of Theorem 1 to make this clear ( the top of Page 17 ) . * * Q : I see no experimental results to support their theory . * * \\ * * A : * * We have added two experiments to support our theory .

Our experimental results show that there is no overfitting even if we run SGD with $ 100 $ passes , which is consistent with our bound in Theorem 1 . Please see Section 5 for details ."}, "3": {"review_id": "r28GdiQF7vM-3", "review_text": "One of the main contributions of this paper lies in the generalization error of O ( 1/n ) under the P-L condition given by Theorem 1 . It provides a generalization bound instead of the hypothesis stability or uniform stability in previous discussions . The result explains generalization even under overparameterized model . Strength : + The theoretical result is novel , according to the authors this is the first paper to model the generalization bound in terms of a $ O ( 1/n\\beta ) $ term plus the convergence rate of the optimization algorithm + The authors applies the main theorem on practical algorithms and derive convergence rate on generalization error while previous literature on those algorithms are mainly on training error . Weakness : - Some of the background description and preliminaries are vague , for example the $ E_ { S , A } $ concerning taking an expectation over an algorithm A are not explained . - The relation of related works with this work is not clear enough . The two paragraphs , `` Algorithmic Stability '' and `` Generalization Analysis '' all ends up with areas that stability/generalization is applicable , while I care more about how previous literature shed lights on this work . - I see no experimental results to support their theory I think it is a good paper that provides novel aspects of understanding . It provides new insights in understanding important phenomenons in training deep neural networks whose Lipchitz constant might be very large . The bound removes the Lipchitz constant and uses training error of the best model instead . It explains why interpolation does not lead to overfitting . However the first part of this paper is a little bit rash while the experimental support is insufficient . Question : How widely is the PL condition applicable ? Are there any examples when the PL condition does not hold ? In Theorem 1 the assumption is $ L \\leq n\\beta/4 $ , while in Corollary 2 the assumption becomes $ L < n\\beta/2 $ , what makes the difference ?", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Thank you for your invaluable and constructive comments . * * Q : Some of the background description and preliminaries are vague , e.g. , the expectation w.r.t.the algorithm . * * \\ * * A : * * We have checked the background description and made necessary changes .

For example , if $ A $ is SGD , then $ \\mathbb { E } _A $ denotes the expectation w.r.t.the random indices of training examples selected for the gradient computation . '' Please see the first paragraph of Section 3 . * * Q : In the related work , I care more about how previous literature shed lights on this work . * * \\ * * A : * * Accordingly , we have re-organized the related work on algorithmic stability . In this revision , we group the discussions according to stability measures . We first discuss the related work on uniform stability . Then we move onto several other stability measures . Finally , we emphasize the on-average stability by indicating its advantage in exploiting either the strong convexity or the relaxed exp-concavity in the existing analysis . This motivates us to use the on-average stability for learning with the PL condition , which is another relaxed condition of strong convexity . We have separated the related work on generalization analysis in two paragraphs . The first paragraph is on the stability approach , and the second paragraph sketches some other approaches . In the end of the first paragraph , we put more discussions on the most related work ( Charles \\ & Papailiopoulos , 2018 ) by presenting some defects . We explain that these defects are due to the use of pointwise hypothesis stability and the ignorance of smoothness property , which motivate us to refine their results by considering the weaker on-average stability and exploiting the smoothness of loss functions . Please see Section 2 for details . * * Q : How widely is the PL condition applicable ? Are there any examples when the PL condition does not hold ? * * \\ * * A : * * PL condition is widely used in the non-convex learning setting ( Zhou et al. , 2018b ; Reddi et al. , 2016 ; Karimi et al. , 2016 ; Wang et al. , 2019 ; Lei et al. , 2017 , Charles \\ & Papailiopoulos , 2018 ; Yuan et al. , 2019 ) . It is shown to hold for strongly convex functions composed with piecewise-linear objectives ( Karimi et al. , 2016 , Charles \\ & Papailiopoulos , 2018 ) , and non-convex learning problems including generalized linear models , robust regression ( Foster et al. , 2019 ) and linear neural networks ( Charles \\ & Papailiopoulos , 2018 , Hardt \\ & Ma , 2016 ) . PL condition can fail for very simple functions . For example , consider the one-dimensional function $ f ( x ) =x^4 $ . Then $ f ' ( x ) =4x^3 $ and the minimal value is $ 0 $ . Furthermore , we have $ $ \\frac { f ( x ) -0 } { |f ' ( x ) |^2 } =\\frac { x^4 } { 16x^6 } =\\frac { 1 } { 16x^2 } \\to\\infty\\text { as } x\\to0 . $ $ Therefore , the PL condition does not hold . * * Q : The difference between the condition $ L\\leq n\\beta/4 $ and $ L < n\\beta/2 $ . * * \\ * * A : * * Under the condition $ L < n\\beta/2 $ , our analysis in the proof of Theorem 1 can actually imply the bound $ $ \\mathbb { E } \\big [ F ( \\mathbf { w } _S ) - \\hat { F } _S\\big ] \\leq \\frac { 8L\\mathbb { E } [ \\hat { F } _S ] } { n\\beta-2L } + \\frac { L\\mathbb { E } \\big [ F_S ( \\mathbf { w } _S ) -\\hat { F } _S\\big ] } { 2\\beta } . $ $ This implies the bound in Theorem 1 by taking a further assumption $ L\\leq n\\beta/4 $ . In Corollary 2 , we assume $ \\mathbb { E } [ \\hat { F } _S ] =0 $ and therefore we can get $ \\frac { 8L\\mathbb { E } [ \\hat { F } _S ] } { n\\beta-2L } =0 $ under the condition $ L < n\\beta/2 $ . We have added a note below the proof of Theorem 1 to make this clear ( the top of Page 17 ) . * * Q : I see no experimental results to support their theory . * * \\ * * A : * * We have added two experiments to support our theory . The first experiment shows that the condition $ L/\\beta\\leq n/4 $ can be violated if $ n $ is small , and holds if $ n $ is large . We observe no overfitting for learning with gradient-dominated functions in the second experiment , which is consistent with Theorem 1 on the resistance of SGD to overfitting under the PL condition .
