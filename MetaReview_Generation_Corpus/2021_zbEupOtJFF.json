To measure the distance between the augmentation and corruption distributions , the paper proposes a new metric , Minimal Sample Distance ( MSD ) , which is the perceptual similarity between an average corruption and the closest augmentation from a finite set of samples sampled from the augmented data distribution . It is shown that MSD overcomes the drawbacks of distributional distance measures like Maximum Mean Discrepancy ( MMD ) . A new benchmark , called ImageNet-C-bar , made up of corruptions that are perceptually dissimilar to ImageNet-C , is introduced . Using standard evaluation , it is empirically shown that several recent augmentation schemes show degraded performance on the new dataset , suggesting that they generate augmentations only perceptually similar to ImageNet-C and thus are prone to overfitting . +ves + Although the notion of the relation between augmentations and test-time corruptions has somewhat already been empirically observed and stated in many previous works , the paper tries to correlate this relation statistically . To my knowledge , this is the first such work . + Through comprehensive evaluations , the paper shows that the proposition of computing MSD rather than MMD correlates well with the relation between augmentations and corruptions observed in reality . + A new benchmark , ImageNet-C-bar is proposed , which shows a useful result to the community that recent SOTA augmentation methods have degraded performance on the new dataset because they generate augmentations close to ImageNet-C corruptions . Concerns - The paper says ( pg 2 ) - \u201c we empirically show an intuitive yet surprisingly overlooked finding : Augmentation-corruption perceptual similarity is a strong predictor of corruption error \u201d . However , this notion of the relation between augmentations and test-time corruptions does not seem very surprising . It \u2019 s perhaps well-known that DNNs will generalize well only when test distributions are fairly similar to training distributions . Hence , the importance of this observation does seem to be overemphasized , although this is certainly of use . - It 's been recently shown that removing texture biases by introducing stylized transformations also improves robustness to common-corruptions ( Geirhos et al , ICLR 2019 ) . However , stylized transformations don \u2019 t look close to any Imagenet-C corruptions . If MSD of stylized transforms is large ( which intuitively seems so ) , then it will mean that MSD is not a reliable metric in such a case . Was this studied ? Would MSD be a reliable metric even in such cases ? It would be good to understand this , to get a more well-rounded picture of the proposed metric . - Paper introduces MSD as a distance metric . However , distance metrics should be symmetric in nature . It is not quite evident from just Eq-1 if MSD is symmetric . - In addition , adding high severity corruption as training augmentation leads to better performance on the same low severity corruption but vice-versa is not true in general . This suggests that measures should perhaps ideally be asymmetric . Clarifying the notion of \u201c distance metric \u201d in this work may be important to make the work mathematically correct . - Standard choices for measuring perceptual distances are VGG-16 or 19 networks pre-trained on ImageNet . However , the paper chooses to use WRN-40-10 trained on CIFAR-10 . This seems to deviate from standard settings . The paper should explain the rationale behind their choice . It will be great to show an ablation on how this choice of feature extractor ( VGG-19 , Robust VGG etc ) affects the MSD . Ideally , the metric should be robust i.e.shouldn \u2019 t be sensitive to the choice of feature extractor . - The practical utility of ImageNet-C-bar seems limited and unclear . The only use that I can think of is using it to identify overfitting on ImageNet-C . I would be happy to understand what I am missing here . POST-REBUTTAL : I thank the authors for the response and the revisions to the paper . I appreciate the authors ' efforts towards the rebuttal . I am however left with some concerns which did not have a convincing resolution : * Regarding the comment on how the proposed analysis would look for stylized transforms , the authors say in the response that `` ... we don \u2019 t expect that perceptual similarity is the only cause of improved corruption error , only that perceptual similarity is particularly salient for predicting generalization to dissimilar corruptions ... '' . The work seems to be one-sided in this regard . If stylized transforms do n't look perceptually similar to ImageNet-C corruptions but provide robustness , this counters the proposed hypothesis . It then becomes important to say where the proposed analysis is meaningful and where it is not . This seems to be lacking at this time in the work . * Regarding the robustness of MSD to the choice of feature extractor ( as also asked by R1 ) , the revised paper includes results on VGG as feature extractor ( thanks to the authors for this ) , but uses a model that is finetuned for CIFAR-10 . In general , perceptual similarity is studied directly taking VGG pre-trained on ImageNet - without finetuning on the target dataset . This leaves this question open , and makes one wonder if the latter features did not support the analysis . * The utility of Imagenet-C-bar as an additional benchmark to check the goodness of performance on Imagenet-C seems a bit convoluted . Would we need a Imagenet-C-bar-bar to check the goodness for corruptions that may be beyond perceptual similarity ( such as stylized transforms ) ? This is not very convincing . Overall , I am still on the fence on this work ( and retain my original decision at this time ) . I think the paper does present an interesting insight , but I am not very convinced it has been studied and explored comprehensively enough . I would have ideally preferred to give a borderline ( neither positive nor negative ) decision , and will not be disappointed if the work is accepted , considering the interesting insights it offers .", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Thank you for recognizing the novelness of quantifying the relationship between perceptual similarity and corruption error , as well as the value of MSD over MMD . You raise several excellent points that we address below . * * This notion of the relation between augmentations and test-time corruptions does not seem very surprising . * * We agree that the relation between augmentations and test-time corruptions is not unknown , but what we find surprising is that it is nevertheless often overlooked in analyses . This is what we intended to emphasize in stating \u201c we empirically show an intuitive yet * * surprisingly overlooked * * finding \u201d . In particular , the approaches used to address the problem are usually ad hoc or missing entirely , and often differ substantially from paper to paper . For example , AugMix removes individual augmentations with exact overlap ; Patch Gaussian is perceptually similar to the noise corruptions , but instead of modifying the augmentation tests on a subset of corruptions ; others still , such as Noisy Student or Assemble-ResNet , use AutoAugment without removing overlapping augmentations but still report ImageNet-C results . This makes it somewhat challenging to fairly compare different robustness-improving methods . By quantifying the relationship and defining an explicit measure of augmentation-corruption similarity , our goal is to provide a tool to better answer \u2018 why does this work ? \u2019 and \u2018 will this generalize beyond the tested benchmarks ? \u2019 for methods proposed in the future . * * If MSD of stylized transforms is large ( which intuitively seems so ) , then it will mean that MSD is not a reliable metric in such a case . Was this studied ? * * We agree SIN would provide an interesting perspective on our method . Unfortunately , there is no CIFAR-10 version of SIN , and it is too computationally expensive to perform the analysis of section 4 on ImageNet . However , if SIN had large MSD despite its good performance , it could be interpreted as a good sign for SIN : if it performs well on a benchmark without being perceptually similar to it , one might expect that it is more likely to generalize to other perceptually dissimilar corruptions as well . More generally , we don \u2019 t expect that perceptual similarity is the only cause of improved corruption error ( e.g. , Yin et al 2019 study the importance of frequency dependence ) , only that perceptual similarity is particularly salient for predicting generalization to dissimilar corruptions . We will reinforce this perspective in the paper . * * This suggests that measures should perhaps ideally be asymmetric . * * Your intuition regarding an asymmetric measure of perceptual similarity is correct , and MSD is indeed asymmetric . We mention this in section 3 when comparing to the symmetric MMD measure . Thank you for pointing out the improper usage of the word \u2018 metric \u2019 to describe MSD : it is a distance in the colloquial sense and not in the formal metric sense , and we did not mean to imply MSD is symmetric . We will remove reference to a metric in the revision . * * The metric should be robust i.e.shouldn \u2019 t be sensitive to the choice of feature extractor . * * We have chosen to use ResNet since it is widely used for robustness benchmarks in the literature , so we reuse it for simplicity . We agree the measure should be robust to changes in the architecture of the feature extractor . We have results using VGG ( modified for CIFAR-10 ) as the feature extractor but see no qualitative changes in how different corruptions and augmentations correlate . We will add plots for this in the revision and have included a table of correlations below for comparison . * * The practical utility of ImageNet-C-bar seems limited and unclear . * * At the moment , ImageNet-C is the most common benchmark for studying corruption robustness , and we expect that it will remain so since it is effective and simple to use . Due to the issues comparing methods discussed in the first paragraph above , we think having an independent check on ImageNet-C performance is itself valuable . More generally , our measure of perceptual similarity could be applied to generate dissimilar transforms for future benchmarks .

It uses this metric to claim that there exists a high correlation between the corruption error and the MSD of a given augmentation . This way , it claims that focusing on benchmarks like ImageNet-C may lead to overfitting to the corruptions present in that benchmark . One problem is that this correlation isn \u2019 t true for all augmentations . Only 4 are highlighted in the main text . As the paper describes , a few corruptions have spearman coefficient of less than 0.5 . Particularly notable is brightness which , despite having very low spearman coefficient , is used to show that Patch Gaussian has \u201c overfit \u201d to the noise corruptions in the ImageNet-C benchmark . This is especially worrying since in their original paper , Patch Gaussian shows improvement in non-noise as well , which couldn \u2019 t have come from overfitting . Additionally , why was AutoAugment , but not RandAugment tested ? Another concern is that it may not make sense to compare single augmentations ( such as Patch Gaussian ) with augmentation policies , such as AutoAugment , RandAugment , and AugMix . It \u2019 s possible that individual augmentations in these policies \u201c overfit \u201d to the corruptions as well , but that this isn \u2019 t shown in MSD due to the use of many corruptions .

The paper argues that AutoAugment `` overfits '' while AugMix does n't , but that 's only because AugMix explicitly removed any augmentations in ImageNet-C from its search space , so it would make sense to repeat this experiment with the augmentations present in AugMix in order to confirm that it does n't indeed `` overfit '' . The paper then suggests that one solution would be to use MSD to sample dissimilar corruptions to test on . However , given that it seems like there \u2019 s no evidence of overfitting for augmentation policies that encourage a diversity of augmentations , such as AugMix ( which is in line with Yin et al 2019 ) .

You raise several important points that we address below . * * This correlation isn \u2019 t true for all augmentations . * * It is true that the correlation between MSD and error does not hold in all cases . We do not think this is surprising : perceptual similarity is only one of multiple interactions between augmentations and corruptions ( e.g. , the frequency dependence of Yin et al 2019 is another ) . One of the goals of this work is to add to the set of tools researchers can use to answer \u2018 why does this work ? \u2019 and \u2018 will this generalize beyond the tested benchmarks ? \u2019 for future robustness-improving methods . MSD is one such tool .

Indeed , at the bottom of page 7 , we argue that despite including exact overlaps with ImageNet-C , AutoAugment actually generalizes the best , since it shows the least degradation on the new corruptions . Section 4 seeks to establish that our measure captures intuitively meaningful information about perceptual similarity , including both exact overlaps like in AutoAugment and perceptually similar ones like for AugMix and Patch Gaussian . We will add additional clarification of this point . Furthermore , in this context our goal is not to argue that any single method like Patch Guassian is unuseful . We agree that Patch Gaussian might be successfully combined with a policy like RandAugment , and that Patch Gaussian may be performant on some corruptions for reasons other than perceptual similarity . * * Brightness is used to show that Patch Gaussian has \u201c overfit \u201d to the noise corruptions in the ImageNet-C benchmark . * * We do not make this argument in this way . In Appendix A , we discuss MMD , for which the Spearman coefficient is low for all corruptions ( this is not MSD , which we use in the main text ) . Our argument here needs only that Patch Gaussian \u2019 s MMD is much lower for these corruptions than for other types . This suggests Patch Gaussian is perceptually similar to only the noise corruptions . Broader augmentation policies , which have components perceptually similar to many dissimilar corruptions , will have low MMD to none of them . Brightness and contrast are included as examples of this second statement , since AutoAugment contains these transforms explicitly but does not have lower MMD here than other augmentations . The behavior of MMD for Patch Gaussian on brightness explicitly is not critical for our argument : it is large for all non-noise corruptions . We will clarify this in the text of Appendix A and include additional plots . * * Why was AutoAugment , but not RandAugment tested ? * * We benchmark AutoAugment because many robustness-improving augmentation papers use AutoAugment but not RandAugment as a component or baseline . We are working on RandAugment , but are having reproducibility problems ( similar to github.com/ildoonet/pytorch-randaugment ) . We will continue working on it and try our best to include results in the revision . Since RandAugment is designed to improve search efficiency but otherwise uses the same individual transforms and compositing method as AutoAugment , we expect similar results . * * It may not make sense to compare single augmentations ( such as Patch Gaussian ) with augmentation policies . * * MSD is designed to handle both individual augmentations and policies over many augmentations , and thus it makes sense to apply it to both . We want a unified approach that can be used to study future augmentation strategies even if there is not a clear division into a policy over separate individual augmentations . Our results also provide quantifiable evidence supporting the intuition you suggest here : broad augmentation policies do appear to perform better than single augmentations . * * It seems like there \u2019 s no evidence of overfitting for augmentation policies that encourage a diversity of augmentations . * * While diverse augmentation policies perform much better , we do not agree that there is no evidence of overfitting .

We fully agree that the result is intuitive , yet published works often ignore the intuition and remove only augmentations that exactly match corruptions . In particular , corruption robustness provides a new and exciting task , and we expect increased effort to improve performance on benchmarks such as ImageNet-C . It will be very important that future reviewers and researchers have quantitative tools on hand to accurately judge and understand these proposals . Regarding your questions : * * What are the augmentations that were used while training the network used to extract features for the metric ? * * The augmentations used to train the feature extractor are the default ones for CIFAR-10 or ImageNet . This is random crop and horizontal flip for CIFAR-10 , and random crop , resize , and horizontal flip for ImageNet ( e.g. , as used by torchvision for training models https : //github.com/pytorch/vision ) . * * Have you verified that the metric is robust to different architectures and the same conclusion holds ? * * We fully agree that the ability to work with different feature extractors is crucial for the framework .

One such example is presented at the bottom of page 6 . We found glass blur acts more like a noise corruption than a blur corruption . This may be because the glass blur algorithm involves permuting pixel values spatially in addition to gaussian blurring . Another is that the contrast corruption is improved by geometric augmentations more than by equalize or auto-contrast augmentations , which are explicitly contrast changing . This may be because equalize and auto-contrast increase contrast , while the contrast corruption and blurring effects from superimposing geometric augmentations decrease contrast . This is an example of the danger of relying on naming or intuition to remove an overlapping augmentation : naively auto-contrast and contrast would be very similar , but we actually find they behave quite differently !

I do n't think they marshaled substantial , far-reaching evidence that `` overfitting indeed occurs . '' They rendered numerous corruptions from Huxtable , 2006 ; Gladman , 2016 ( which I very much appreciate ) and adversarially chose the worst corruptions . As a result , the best models performed worse by a few percent compared to ImageNet-C. _A drop is inevitable and expected given the adversarial selection . If the drop was consistently more than , say , 20 % , then there might be strong evidence of overfitting._ Since the degradation for some techniques is small , this strikes me as evidence that by-and-large the community is n't overfitting .

If these papers have very different ratings , then there 's a problem with this review process . `` AugMix , which introduces a broad array of both geometric and color augmentations '' No it does n't . It removes several color augmentations from AutoAugment and does n't introduce any augmentation primitive beyond elementwise convex combinations . `` On other corruptions , the increase in error is even worse than the mean would suggest , and even broad augmentations like AugMix .... '' AutoAugment is more broad ; AugMix is narrower . `` Second , AutoAugment is the only tested augmentation scheme that was designed before the release of ImageNet-C '' AugMix uses a proper subset of AutoAugment 's augmentations . It 's not as though AugMix added in distortions to fit ImageNet-C ; it removes augmentations because AA fits some of ImageNet-C 's corruptions directly . This observation makes their overfitting case hard to maintain . Also , if AutoAugment 's full augmentation list is fair game for ImageNet-\\bar { C } , then the authors should train AugMix with the full set of augmentations and make that comparison ; the generalization discrepancy would likely be even smaller were the augmentation sets made equal . From the `` Corruption robustness as a secondary learning task '' section : `` To mitigate overfitting , standard machine learning practice would dictate a training/validation/test set split ; it is only the size and breadth of modern vision datasets that has allowed this to be neglected in certain cases recently .

This section might be negligent or worse for not acknowledging the already existent ImageNet-C validation set . ImageNet-C provides a validation set with about half the corruptions of ImageNet-\\bar { C } . There are 19 available ImageNet-C corruptions , so the community already has a validation set . The authors should cite or compare to other works that use feature distances to predict generalization . An example is `` The Frechet Distance of training and test distribution predicts the generalization gap .

It is not our intent to formulate our paper primarily as proposing a new corruption benchmark , nor to suggest that existing augmentation methods are not making meaningful progress on improving corruption robustness . ImageNet-C has enabled rapid progress that has already allowed for several new insights into how to improve corruption robustness , using both augmentations and other methods . However , approaches to augmentation-corruption overlap differ from paper to paper . By developing a quantifiable measure for perceptual similarity , we aim to better understand how this overlap affects results . As additional methods are developed using benchmarks like ImageNet-C , we think it is important that scientists have concrete tools to determine why a method is working and if it should be expected to generalize beyond the tested benchmarks . For instance , recent work such as * The many faces of robustness : A critical analysis of out-of-distribution generalization * has shown that very broad , diverse augmentation distributions tend to generalize better to additional corruption benchmarks . Our work provides intuitions that support the case that such a broad augmentation method is needed . Thanks to your comments we realize that our title may prime a reader in a way that we did not anticipate and we will change it . Note , though , that we have already not mentioned ImageNet-C-Bar by name in the abstract to deemphasize the dataset as a primary result , and we will clarify the text to deemphasize it further . Our intent was that discussion of overfitting was a case study in how to use our tools and not a judgment on the field as a whole , and we will make this explicit . * * A drop is inevitable and expected given the adversarial selection . * * Note that no adversarial selection is performed with respect to the augmentations , so a drop in accuracy is not guaranteed . Only CIFAR-10/Imagenet-C was used in the process of finding dissimilar corruptions , and we deliberately did not look at augmentation results before fixing the dataset selection method . We will highlight this in the text . We want to point out that even the best methods don \u2019 t make a 20 % improvement on ImageNet-C , so a 20 % drop does not seem possible . We agree that the loss in error is small and that the methods studied here are still effective . However , we are arguing that care must be taken when comparing different augmentation methods .

We disagree with this point-of-view as we have already witnessed several new and exciting methods developed thanks to ImageNet-C . Instead , our goal is to provide tools to quantify how augmentation-corruption overlap affects corruption error , so that future methods developed using ImageNet-C can be better understood and compared . * * AutoAugment is more broad ; AugMix is narrower . * * We would argue that , because AugMix can produce perceptually new effects by combining transforms ( e.g.blur-like effects from superimposing differently shifted images , as shown in Figure 1 ) , it may be broader than would be suggested by just counting individual base transforms .

Using standard evaluation , it is empirically shown that several recent augmentation schemes show degraded performance on the new dataset , suggesting that they generate augmentations only perceptually similar to ImageNet-C and thus are prone to overfitting . +ves + Although the notion of the relation between augmentations and test-time corruptions has somewhat already been empirically observed and stated in many previous works , the paper tries to correlate this relation statistically . To my knowledge , this is the first such work . + Through comprehensive evaluations , the paper shows that the proposition of computing MSD rather than MMD correlates well with the relation between augmentations and corruptions observed in reality . + A new benchmark , ImageNet-C-bar is proposed , which shows a useful result to the community that recent SOTA augmentation methods have degraded performance on the new dataset because they generate augmentations close to ImageNet-C corruptions . Concerns - The paper says ( pg 2 ) - \u201c we empirically show an intuitive yet surprisingly overlooked finding : Augmentation-corruption perceptual similarity is a strong predictor of corruption error \u201d . However , this notion of the relation between augmentations and test-time corruptions does not seem very surprising . It \u2019 s perhaps well-known that DNNs will generalize well only when test distributions are fairly similar to training distributions . Hence , the importance of this observation does seem to be overemphasized , although this is certainly of use . - It 's been recently shown that removing texture biases by introducing stylized transformations also improves robustness to common-corruptions ( Geirhos et al , ICLR 2019 ) . However , stylized transformations don \u2019 t look close to any Imagenet-C corruptions . If MSD of stylized transforms is large ( which intuitively seems so ) , then it will mean that MSD is not a reliable metric in such a case . Was this studied ? Would MSD be a reliable metric even in such cases ? It would be good to understand this , to get a more well-rounded picture of the proposed metric . - Paper introduces MSD as a distance metric . However , distance metrics should be symmetric in nature . It is not quite evident from just Eq-1 if MSD is symmetric . - In addition , adding high severity corruption as training augmentation leads to better performance on the same low severity corruption but vice-versa is not true in general . This suggests that measures should perhaps ideally be asymmetric . Clarifying the notion of \u201c distance metric \u201d in this work may be important to make the work mathematically correct . - Standard choices for measuring perceptual distances are VGG-16 or 19 networks pre-trained on ImageNet . However , the paper chooses to use WRN-40-10 trained on CIFAR-10 . This seems to deviate from standard settings . The paper should explain the rationale behind their choice . It will be great to show an ablation on how this choice of feature extractor ( VGG-19 , Robust VGG etc ) affects the MSD . Ideally , the metric should be robust i.e.shouldn \u2019 t be sensitive to the choice of feature extractor . - The practical utility of ImageNet-C-bar seems limited and unclear . The only use that I can think of is using it to identify overfitting on ImageNet-C . I would be happy to understand what I am missing here . POST-REBUTTAL : I thank the authors for the response and the revisions to the paper . I appreciate the authors ' efforts towards the rebuttal . I am however left with some concerns which did not have a convincing resolution : * Regarding the comment on how the proposed analysis would look for stylized transforms , the authors say in the response that `` ... we don \u2019 t expect that perceptual similarity is the only cause of improved corruption error , only that perceptual similarity is particularly salient for predicting generalization to dissimilar corruptions ... '' . The work seems to be one-sided in this regard . If stylized transforms do n't look perceptually similar to ImageNet-C corruptions but provide robustness , this counters the proposed hypothesis . It then becomes important to say where the proposed analysis is meaningful and where it is not . This seems to be lacking at this time in the work . * Regarding the robustness of MSD to the choice of feature extractor ( as also asked by R1 ) , the revised paper includes results on VGG as feature extractor ( thanks to the authors for this ) , but uses a model that is finetuned for CIFAR-10 . In general , perceptual similarity is studied directly taking VGG pre-trained on ImageNet - without finetuning on the target dataset . This leaves this question open , and makes one wonder if the latter features did not support the analysis . * The utility of Imagenet-C-bar as an additional benchmark to check the goodness of performance on Imagenet-C seems a bit convoluted . Would we need a Imagenet-C-bar-bar to check the goodness for corruptions that may be beyond perceptual similarity ( such as stylized transforms ) ? This is not very convincing . Overall , I am still on the fence on this work ( and retain my original decision at this time ) . I think the paper does present an interesting insight , but I am not very convinced it has been studied and explored comprehensively enough . I would have ideally preferred to give a borderline ( neither positive nor negative ) decision , and will not be disappointed if the work is accepted , considering the interesting insights it offers .", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Thank you for recognizing the novelness of quantifying the relationship between perceptual similarity and corruption error , as well as the value of MSD over MMD .

This is what we intended to emphasize in stating \u201c we empirically show an intuitive yet * * surprisingly overlooked * * finding \u201d . In particular , the approaches used to address the problem are usually ad hoc or missing entirely , and often differ substantially from paper to paper . For example , AugMix removes individual augmentations with exact overlap ; Patch Gaussian is perceptually similar to the noise corruptions , but instead of modifying the augmentation tests on a subset of corruptions ; others still , such as Noisy Student or Assemble-ResNet , use AutoAugment without removing overlapping augmentations but still report ImageNet-C results . This makes it somewhat challenging to fairly compare different robustness-improving methods . By quantifying the relationship and defining an explicit measure of augmentation-corruption similarity , our goal is to provide a tool to better answer \u2018 why does this work ? \u2019 and \u2018 will this generalize beyond the tested benchmarks ? \u2019 for methods proposed in the future . * * If MSD of stylized transforms is large ( which intuitively seems so ) , then it will mean that MSD is not a reliable metric in such a case . Was this studied ? * * We agree SIN would provide an interesting perspective on our method . Unfortunately , there is no CIFAR-10 version of SIN , and it is too computationally expensive to perform the analysis of section 4 on ImageNet . However , if SIN had large MSD despite its good performance , it could be interpreted as a good sign for SIN : if it performs well on a benchmark without being perceptually similar to it , one might expect that it is more likely to generalize to other perceptually dissimilar corruptions as well . More generally , we don \u2019 t expect that perceptual similarity is the only cause of improved corruption error ( e.g. , Yin et al 2019 study the importance of frequency dependence ) , only that perceptual similarity is particularly salient for predicting generalization to dissimilar corruptions . We will reinforce this perspective in the paper . * * This suggests that measures should perhaps ideally be asymmetric . * * Your intuition regarding an asymmetric measure of perceptual similarity is correct , and MSD is indeed asymmetric . We mention this in section 3 when comparing to the symmetric MMD measure . Thank you for pointing out the improper usage of the word \u2018 metric \u2019 to describe MSD : it is a distance in the colloquial sense and not in the formal metric sense , and we did not mean to imply MSD is symmetric . We will remove reference to a metric in the revision . * * The metric should be robust i.e.shouldn \u2019 t be sensitive to the choice of feature extractor . * * We have chosen to use ResNet since it is widely used for robustness benchmarks in the literature , so we reuse it for simplicity . We agree the measure should be robust to changes in the architecture of the feature extractor . We have results using VGG ( modified for CIFAR-10 ) as the feature extractor but see no qualitative changes in how different corruptions and augmentations correlate . We will add plots for this in the revision and have included a table of correlations below for comparison . * * The practical utility of ImageNet-C-bar seems limited and unclear . * * At the moment , ImageNet-C is the most common benchmark for studying corruption robustness , and we expect that it will remain so since it is effective and simple to use . Due to the issues comparing methods discussed in the first paragraph above , we think having an independent check on ImageNet-C performance is itself valuable . More generally , our measure of perceptual similarity could be applied to generate dissimilar transforms for future benchmarks .

It uses this metric to claim that there exists a high correlation between the corruption error and the MSD of a given augmentation . This way , it claims that focusing on benchmarks like ImageNet-C may lead to overfitting to the corruptions present in that benchmark . One problem is that this correlation isn \u2019 t true for all augmentations . Only 4 are highlighted in the main text . As the paper describes , a few corruptions have spearman coefficient of less than 0.5 . Particularly notable is brightness which , despite having very low spearman coefficient , is used to show that Patch Gaussian has \u201c overfit \u201d to the noise corruptions in the ImageNet-C benchmark . This is especially worrying since in their original paper , Patch Gaussian shows improvement in non-noise as well , which couldn \u2019 t have come from overfitting . Additionally , why was AutoAugment , but not RandAugment tested ? Another concern is that it may not make sense to compare single augmentations ( such as Patch Gaussian ) with augmentation policies , such as AutoAugment , RandAugment , and AugMix . It \u2019 s possible that individual augmentations in these policies \u201c overfit \u201d to the corruptions as well , but that this isn \u2019 t shown in MSD due to the use of many corruptions . In which case , using PatchGaussian in the RandAugment search space ( for instance ) would resolve any issues . The paper argues that AutoAugment `` overfits '' while AugMix does n't , but that 's only because AugMix explicitly removed any augmentations in ImageNet-C from its search space , so it would make sense to repeat this experiment with the augmentations present in AugMix in order to confirm that it does n't indeed `` overfit '' . The paper then suggests that one solution would be to use MSD to sample dissimilar corruptions to test on . However , given that it seems like there \u2019 s no evidence of overfitting for augmentation policies that encourage a diversity of augmentations , such as AugMix ( which is in line with Yin et al 2019 ) .

You raise several important points that we address below . * * This correlation isn \u2019 t true for all augmentations . * * It is true that the correlation between MSD and error does not hold in all cases . We do not think this is surprising : perceptual similarity is only one of multiple interactions between augmentations and corruptions ( e.g. , the frequency dependence of Yin et al 2019 is another ) . One of the goals of this work is to add to the set of tools researchers can use to answer \u2018 why does this work ? \u2019 and \u2018 will this generalize beyond the tested benchmarks ? \u2019 for future robustness-improving methods . MSD is one such tool .

Indeed , at the bottom of page 7 , we argue that despite including exact overlaps with ImageNet-C , AutoAugment actually generalizes the best , since it shows the least degradation on the new corruptions . Section 4 seeks to establish that our measure captures intuitively meaningful information about perceptual similarity , including both exact overlaps like in AutoAugment and perceptually similar ones like for AugMix and Patch Gaussian . We will add additional clarification of this point . Furthermore , in this context our goal is not to argue that any single method like Patch Guassian is unuseful . We agree that Patch Gaussian might be successfully combined with a policy like RandAugment , and that Patch Gaussian may be performant on some corruptions for reasons other than perceptual similarity . * * Brightness is used to show that Patch Gaussian has \u201c overfit \u201d to the noise corruptions in the ImageNet-C benchmark . * * We do not make this argument in this way . In Appendix A , we discuss MMD , for which the Spearman coefficient is low for all corruptions ( this is not MSD , which we use in the main text ) . Our argument here needs only that Patch Gaussian \u2019 s MMD is much lower for these corruptions than for other types . This suggests Patch Gaussian is perceptually similar to only the noise corruptions . Broader augmentation policies , which have components perceptually similar to many dissimilar corruptions , will have low MMD to none of them . Brightness and contrast are included as examples of this second statement , since AutoAugment contains these transforms explicitly but does not have lower MMD here than other augmentations . The behavior of MMD for Patch Gaussian on brightness explicitly is not critical for our argument : it is large for all non-noise corruptions . We will clarify this in the text of Appendix A and include additional plots . * * Why was AutoAugment , but not RandAugment tested ? * * We benchmark AutoAugment because many robustness-improving augmentation papers use AutoAugment but not RandAugment as a component or baseline . We are working on RandAugment , but are having reproducibility problems ( similar to github.com/ildoonet/pytorch-randaugment ) . We will continue working on it and try our best to include results in the revision . Since RandAugment is designed to improve search efficiency but otherwise uses the same individual transforms and compositing method as AutoAugment , we expect similar results . * * It may not make sense to compare single augmentations ( such as Patch Gaussian ) with augmentation policies . * * MSD is designed to handle both individual augmentations and policies over many augmentations , and thus it makes sense to apply it to both . We want a unified approach that can be used to study future augmentation strategies even if there is not a clear division into a policy over separate individual augmentations .

We fully agree that the result is intuitive , yet published works often ignore the intuition and remove only augmentations that exactly match corruptions . In particular , corruption robustness provides a new and exciting task , and we expect increased effort to improve performance on benchmarks such as ImageNet-C . It will be very important that future reviewers and researchers have quantitative tools on hand to accurately judge and understand these proposals . Regarding your questions : * * What are the augmentations that were used while training the network used to extract features for the metric ? * * The augmentations used to train the feature extractor are the default ones for CIFAR-10 or ImageNet . This is random crop and horizontal flip for CIFAR-10 , and random crop , resize , and horizontal flip for ImageNet ( e.g. , as used by torchvision for training models https : //github.com/pytorch/vision ) . * * Have you verified that the metric is robust to different architectures and the same conclusion holds ? * * We fully agree that the ability to work with different feature extractors is crucial for the framework .

One such example is presented at the bottom of page 6 . We found glass blur acts more like a noise corruption than a blur corruption . This may be because the glass blur algorithm involves permuting pixel values spatially in addition to gaussian blurring . Another is that the contrast corruption is improved by geometric augmentations more than by equalize or auto-contrast augmentations , which are explicitly contrast changing . This may be because equalize and auto-contrast increase contrast , while the contrast corruption and blurring effects from superimposing geometric augmentations decrease contrast . This is an example of the danger of relying on naming or intuition to remove an overlapping augmentation : naively auto-contrast and contrast would be very similar , but we actually find they behave quite differently !

I do n't think they marshaled substantial , far-reaching evidence that `` overfitting indeed occurs . '' They rendered numerous corruptions from Huxtable , 2006 ; Gladman , 2016 ( which I very much appreciate ) and adversarially chose the worst corruptions . As a result , the best models performed worse by a few percent compared to ImageNet-C. _A drop is inevitable and expected given the adversarial selection . If the drop was consistently more than , say , 20 % , then there might be strong evidence of overfitting._ Since the degradation for some techniques is small , this strikes me as evidence that by-and-large the community is n't overfitting .

If these papers have very different ratings , then there 's a problem with this review process . `` AugMix , which introduces a broad array of both geometric and color augmentations '' No it does n't . It removes several color augmentations from AutoAugment and does n't introduce any augmentation primitive beyond elementwise convex combinations . `` On other corruptions , the increase in error is even worse than the mean would suggest , and even broad augmentations like AugMix .... '' AutoAugment is more broad ; AugMix is narrower . `` Second , AutoAugment is the only tested augmentation scheme that was designed before the release of ImageNet-C '' AugMix uses a proper subset of AutoAugment 's augmentations . It 's not as though AugMix added in distortions to fit ImageNet-C ; it removes augmentations because AA fits some of ImageNet-C 's corruptions directly . This observation makes their overfitting case hard to maintain . Also , if AutoAugment 's full augmentation list is fair game for ImageNet-\\bar { C } , then the authors should train AugMix with the full set of augmentations and make that comparison ; the generalization discrepancy would likely be even smaller were the augmentation sets made equal . From the `` Corruption robustness as a secondary learning task '' section : `` To mitigate overfitting , standard machine learning practice would dictate a training/validation/test set split ; it is only the size and breadth of modern vision datasets that has allowed this to be neglected in certain cases recently .

This section might be negligent or worse for not acknowledging the already existent ImageNet-C validation set . ImageNet-C provides a validation set with about half the corruptions of ImageNet-\\bar { C } . There are 19 available ImageNet-C corruptions , so the community already has a validation set . The authors should cite or compare to other works that use feature distances to predict generalization .

It is not our intent to formulate our paper primarily as proposing a new corruption benchmark , nor to suggest that existing augmentation methods are not making meaningful progress on improving corruption robustness . ImageNet-C has enabled rapid progress that has already allowed for several new insights into how to improve corruption robustness , using both augmentations and other methods . However , approaches to augmentation-corruption overlap differ from paper to paper . By developing a quantifiable measure for perceptual similarity , we aim to better understand how this overlap affects results . As additional methods are developed using benchmarks like ImageNet-C , we think it is important that scientists have concrete tools to determine why a method is working and if it should be expected to generalize beyond the tested benchmarks . For instance , recent work such as * The many faces of robustness : A critical analysis of out-of-distribution generalization * has shown that very broad , diverse augmentation distributions tend to generalize better to additional corruption benchmarks . Our work provides intuitions that support the case that such a broad augmentation method is needed . Thanks to your comments we realize that our title may prime a reader in a way that we did not anticipate and we will change it . Note , though , that we have already not mentioned ImageNet-C-Bar by name in the abstract to deemphasize the dataset as a primary result , and we will clarify the text to deemphasize it further . Our intent was that discussion of overfitting was a case study in how to use our tools and not a judgment on the field as a whole , and we will make this explicit . * * A drop is inevitable and expected given the adversarial selection . * * Note that no adversarial selection is performed with respect to the augmentations , so a drop in accuracy is not guaranteed . Only CIFAR-10/Imagenet-C was used in the process of finding dissimilar corruptions , and we deliberately did not look at augmentation results before fixing the dataset selection method . We will highlight this in the text . We want to point out that even the best methods don \u2019 t make a 20 % improvement on ImageNet-C , so a 20 % drop does not seem possible . We agree that the loss in error is small and that the methods studied here are still effective . However , we are arguing that care must be taken when comparing different augmentation methods . If a new method claims improvement over existing methods because of a small gain on ImageNet-C , then a small loss due to overfitting * is * important . * * This paper is fairly similar to submission # 1101 . * * We would draw a distinction with this submission , which does not study augmentations and appears to be arguing for flaws in ImageNet-C that require its replacement . We disagree with this point-of-view as we have already witnessed several new and exciting methods developed thanks to ImageNet-C . Instead , our goal is to provide tools to quantify how augmentation-corruption overlap affects corruption error , so that future methods developed using ImageNet-C can be better understood and compared . * * AutoAugment is more broad ; AugMix is narrower . * * We would argue that , because AugMix can produce perceptually new effects by combining transforms ( e.g.blur-like effects from superimposing differently shifted images , as shown in Figure 1 ) , it may be broader than would be suggested by just counting individual base transforms .

Since the goal is robustness to unknown image corruptions , generalization within perceptually similar transformations is unlikely to be sufficient . We will clarify these points and deemphasize ImageNet-C-Bar in this section . * * The authors should cite or compare to other works that use feature distances to predict generalization . * * Thank you for bringing this to our attention . We note that for corruption robustness , it is not optimal to make the training distribution as close as possible to some given test distribution , since the ultimate goal is robustness to unknown natural corruptions .
