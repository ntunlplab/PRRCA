Essentially, the model leans the many-to-many mapping between the cell types and different protein markers' expression levels. Compared with the other mainstream GAN methods, the authors show the proposed method, CCIGAN, can outperform them in terms of generating the expression map of different protein markers given the segmentation of cell types. The manuscript also has an in-depth discussion of the biological meaning of the learned model as well as the learned vectors. I personally like this manuscript a lot, considering the novelty and the thoroughness of the manuscript. However, I have the following concerns: Major concern (The score will be significantly improved if the authors can handle these two concerns during revision): 1. My largest concern is how useful the proposed method is. It seems the wet experiments are mature. How can the computational synthesized image help the biologists then? Are there any cases that only the CCIGAN can do while the real experiment can not do? I am not an expert in MIBI-TOF, but I guess all the results in Section 6.2 can be easily achieved with the real data, right? 2. CCIGAN is indeed better than the other methods, but would it be accepted by the biologists in terms of performance? Would they believe in the results? In fact, in the last column of Figure 2, we can see clear artifacts for the results generated by CCIGAN. Minor concern: 1. What's the resolution of the MIBI-TOF and CCIGAN? 2. The introduction of the background could be further refined. The many-to-many mapping between different cell types and different protein markers is not emphasized explicitly. Readers can get lost easily. 3. The data part is not clear. How many M*2048*2048 images do the authors have for training as well for testing? 4. Why do the authors choose 64*64 as the image path size? 5. Can the model be generalized well for data collected in different experiments (i.e., different tissues) but from the same machine? Can the model be generalized well across different machines with the same imaging experimental setting? 6. Is the model sensitive to the preprocessing of the data, like normalization? As for as I know, the baseline expression level of tissue can vary significantly at different time points within one day. If the model is sensitive to that, it will affect the usage of the model.", "rating": "3: Weak Reject", "reply_text": "Minor concern : 1 . What 's the resolution of the MIBI-TOF and CCIGAN ? MIBI TOF is 800 $ mm^2 $ at 2048x2048 pixels , doing some rearranging we see that 64x64 $ \\rightarrow $ 64/2048 * 800 = $ 25 mm^2 $ 2 . The introduction of the background could be further refined .

We also included Figures 1 ( B ) ( https : //imgur.com/a/pKzch1J ) , Figure 5 ( https : //imgur.com/a/1gckfA3 ) showing the purpose of the model of being able to pose arbitrary cell orientation scenarios . Additionally we have revised our evaluation portion to make it easier to understand what biological phenomenon we are corroborating and which metrics we used to do so . 3.The data part is not clear . How many M * 2048 * 2048 images do the authors have for training as well for testing ? 1 image with a 90-10 split on the image space to ensure no cell overlap . Now we have trained and included additional patients ( each patient has one ( M,2048,2048 ) image ) . 4.Why do the authors choose 64 * 64 as the image path size ? This is a common output size , we can scale our model larger but computationally for other datasets . This provides on average 8 cells , with a max of 15 and this captures enough interactions . Later on as we explore more datasets , we can scale this resolution up . 5.Can the model be generalized well for data collected in different experiments ( i.e. , different tissues ) but from the same machine ? Can the model be generalized well across different machines with the same imaging experimental setting ? Yes the model is agnostic to the technology ( for example CODEX , Vectra ) as long as semantic segmentations are given . We are evaluating more patients to show cross patient tumor ( infiltrated/non infiltrated ) micro-environments that is of value to biologists . This will allow different hypothesis testing environments for understanding interactions between patients . 6.Is the model sensitive to the preprocessing of the data , like normalization ? As for as I know , the baseline expression level of tissue can vary significantly at different time points within one day . If the model is sensitive to that , it will affect the usage of the model . Normalization matters in these experiments ( current protocols stain together to limit batch effects between FOV , but this is experimental wet lab side ) . Yes normalization can affect samples and in turn the model , but this is all on the experimental side . We are assuming these steps are done properly before . Additionally , we are measuring relatively within the patients . There are experimental techniques to try to mitigate these effects , such as patient samples being made into a TMA ( tissue microarray ) in one slide and stained at the same time to try to minimize the batch effects . Autofluorescence will add some base noise , but MIBI does not do this , so signals are much less affected in terms of expression and non expression .

However , we can do further studies related to the different tumor scenarios across the patient dataset . We have added additional experiments in showing that we can recapitulate further established biological phenomena information beyond PD-1/PD-L1 [ 1 ] , Pan-Keratin/CD8 [ 2 ] interactions ( Section 5.2 , 5.3 ) . In particular we added an experiment to demonstrate we can further recapitulate a study done on TNBC data captured by MIBI-TOF [ 3 ] ( Section 5.4 ) . We added macrophage , tumor , and various T-cell interactions in tumor infiltrated environments and tumor compartmentalized environments for different patients ( Figure 1 ( B ) ) .

They propose an interesting architecture design with protein-specific attention to find association between cell types and neighboring pattens and cell-cell interactions. They also propose new and biologically interpretable metrics including a reconstruction metric, projected EMD and regressing of expression on neighbors. They present improved reconstruction of interactions compared to other models in the context of PD-1 and PD-L1 interactions. It would be great to extend the evaluation to other interactions and tissue types. Overall the paper is well written, the application and especially the focus on cell-cell interactions is novel. The model is properly justified and evaluated, and there is a high demand for this framework in the multiplexed imaging field. ", "rating": "6: Weak Accept", "reply_text": "We thank the reviewer for their time and comments and would like to include the following : 1 . \u201c It would be great to extend the evaluation to other interactions and tissue types. \u201d Because MIBI only has 1 dataset available ( as of November 2019 ) , other tissues would be very difficult or impossible to compare/get . However , we can do further studies related to the different tumor scenarios across the patient dataset . We have added additional experiments in showing that we can recapitulate further established biological phenomena information beyond PD-1/PD-L1 [ 1 ] , Pan-Keratin/CD8 [ 2 ] interactions ( Section 5.2 , 5.3 ) . In particular we added an experiment to demonstrate we can further recapitulate a study done on TNBC data captured by MIBI-TOF [ 3 ] ( Section 5.4 ) . We added macrophage , tumor , and various T-cell interactions in tumor infiltrated environments and tumor compartmentalized environments for different patients ( Figure 1 ( B ) ) . We find that CCIGAN is able to not only recapitulate the results in tumor infiltrated and non infiltrated environments discovered in the TNBC data [ 3 ] , but also quantify them at a subcellular level . 2. \u201c Overall the paper is well written , the application and especially the focus on cell-cell interactions is novel . The model is properly justified and evaluated , and there is a high demand for this framework in the multiplexed imaging field. \u201d Thanks for the positive comments ! We have further refined and restructured the introduction to make our contributions more apparent , such as CCIGAN \u2019 s purpose of offering a model for quick in silico hypothesis testing of counterfactual cell-cell interaction scenarios . We have also moved the bulk of the evaluation criteria ( section 5 ) into the appendix and combined Section 5 and 6 for easier reading to showcase more cell-cell interactions and their corresponding evaluation methods .
