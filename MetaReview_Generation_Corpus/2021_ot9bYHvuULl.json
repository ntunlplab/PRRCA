The measures are then compared using the sliced Wasserstein distance on these augmented representations.

The authors propose to learn in a robust/adversarial way these augmentations. They propose simple experiments to illustrate that idea.\n\nAlthough I found the idea interesting, I think it falls short of acceptance at ICLR. I agree with the sentiment of other reviewers 1 and 2 that defining another variant of robust/NN inspired variant of the W distance is interesting, but at this point the readership of the conference expects more than simple experiments on toy data and hard to interpret GAN results. I think there is value in the draft as it stands now, but that more efforts are needed to convince this variant is scalable / useful for other downstream tasks (e.g. W barycenters, or other easier to interpret W problems in lower dimensions).\n\nminor comments\n- as it stands, equation 2 is wrong if you do not add more conditions on the cost function d(.,.). \n- \" the idea of SWD by projecting distributions onto hypersurfaces rather than hyperplane\" -> this is wrong, the projection is done onto lines or curves, not hyperplanes or hypersurfaces.\n", "reviews": [{"review_id": "ot9bYHvuULl-0", "review_text": "This paper introduces the augmented sliced Wasserstein distances ( ASWD ) to capture non-linear projections , as opposed to sliced Wasserstein distances .

We have clarified in Section 4.1 of the paper that `` As in Kolouri et al . ( 2019a ) , the * 2-Wasserstein distance * was used as the metric for evaluating performance of different distance metrics in this task '' . We would like to clarify that in this sliced Wasserstein flow experiment , the numerical results presented in Figure 2 show that the ASWD produces lower 2-Wasserstein distances , which are exact Wasserstein distances instead of ASWDs , as a result of better sliced Wasserstein flow due to the incorporation of the ASWD . But this does not imply that the ASWD is smaller than the other measures . On the contrary , as we presented in Figure 1 , given two distributions , since the ASWD projects samples onto distinguishing hypersurfaces where the projected samples are well-separated , the ASWD is larger than the SWD in expectation . The idea behind the ASWD is that we would like to find hypersurfaces that distinguish between two ( empirical ) distributions under * random * projections . So , we maximize the objective specified by Equation ( 16 ) , instead of minimizing it . When employing the ASWD as the distance metric , small distances between projected samples indeed can be obtained if the distance is calculated along orthogonal directions . However , since multiple random projections are involved and the distances between projected samples are averaged in the calculation of the ASWD , orthogonal projections generally have no significant impact on the value of the ASWD , coupled with the fact that the nonlinear mapping $ g ( \\cdot ) $ is learned to maximize the ASWD under random projections . In fact , Figure 1 shows that ASWD produces much more significant distances under random projections compared to the SWD . ( 2 ) `` * Can I use this method to construct arbitrary nonlinear projections of choice instead of the projection that gives the best distinction ? In that broader sense I suppose my question deals with trying to identify barycenters of objects via sliced Wasserstein distances . * '' Surely you can . As you mentioned , in our work , the mapping $ g ( \\cdot ) $ is optimized so that random projections of the mapped samples between two distributions give the best distinction . In other applications , one may explore other optimization objectives and schemes . For example , for finding the barycenter of objects via slicing-based Wasserstein distance , there are two potential directions to explore - a straightforward approach is to optimize the mapping $ g ( \\cdot ) $ by maximizing the ASWD between objects , then use the learned mapping to calculate the barycenter ; another way is an alternating optimization scheme , alternating between optimizing $ g ( \\cdot ) $ by maximizing the weighted average ASWD between the barycenter and the objects , and optimizing the barycenter by minimizing this weighted average ASWD distance ( the optimization objective specified in Eq . ( 32 ) of [ 1 ] ) . This is a very interesting topic but we consider it out of scope for this paper . We have now added this in the paper as a future research direction in Section 5 . [ 1 ] N.

We respectfully disagree that the paper is purely experimental - we developed a novel technique , characterized its theoretical properties through one theorem and two lemmas as well as their proofs , presented the numerical implementation recipe , and provided the results of numerical experiments that indicate it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art slicing-based OT metrics in the same experiments that those metrics were originally evaluated . Hence , the contributions of this paper are on the methodology side validated by both theoretical properties and experiment results . The issue of low projection efficiency in the SWD is addressed through optimizing a hypersurface where the compared distributions are projected onto , such that the projected samples are well-separated and the projection efficiency is improved . Hence , the proposed ASWD is well-motivated and we demonstrated that the ASWD is a valid metric with injective mapping ( Theorem 1 ) .

The regularization coefficient $ \\lambda $ is only used when optimizing the hypersurface , once the optimization is completed , $ \\lambda $ has no effect on the calculation of the ASWD . In particular , $ \\lambda $ is not involved in the ASWD defined by Eq . ( 13 ) if the mapping $ g_\\omega ( \\cdot ) $ has been learned .
