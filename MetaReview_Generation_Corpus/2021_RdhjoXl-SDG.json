The presented model is defined on multiple scales with information on finer scales being conditioned on coarser scales . Data generation is hence done sequentially from a coarser to finer scale . The authors argue that this multi-scale sampling helps in addressing the curse of dimensionality problem by allowing to sample from high density regions more efficiently . As a core part of the model , the authors present a linear layer that combines information from a coarse scale and a noise vector to predict the data on a finer scale . This prior conditioning layer , as the authors call it , exploits the fact that the downsampling operation from a finer scale to a coarser scale is a linear operation . Under the assumption that the fine scale data follows a multivariate normal distribution , the downsampling operation can be analytically inverted . Training is done by minimizing Jeffreys divergence , i.e.the loss is calculated bi-directinally in the forward and the backward direction of the model , akin to Ardizzone et al . ( 2019 ) .The authors argue that Jeffreys divergence is less prone to the mode dropping that can happen when training with KL divergence . The authors justify this argument by citing Nielsen & Nock ( 2009 ) , by doing ablation studies on toy data , and by giving a toy example in Appendix C. Due to the multi-scale structure and the fact that the coarse scale data can be generated from a fixed corruption process ( the downsampling model ) , it is possible to train this model by decoupling the different scales . The authors suggest to train the model from a coarser to finer scale in a multi-stage process . The authors claim the superiority of this approach to regular end-to-end training . In an extensive experimental section , the authors evaluate their approach on two 'Bayesian Inverse Problems ' , as well as on generative modeling of the Celeb A 64 data set . In further experiments , the authors perform ablation studies on a synthetic data set in order to justify their presented approach . In all experiments , the presented approach yields the highest performance . # Assessment Summary The presented model and training approach exploit the hierarchical nature of data in a smart way . This in turn results in good performance on a number of data sets . The experimental section is rigorous and convincing . These aspects of the work should put me in favor of acceptance if it were n't for the lack of clarity in places ( see below ) . In its current state the paper does not explain the method well enough in order to get a full understanding of the approach . I therefore tend to reject the paper at this stage . With appropriate improvements in the writing I would be happy to improve my score . # Positives - A multi-scale approach is a reasonable choice in many real world applications . The presented model exploits our world knowledge by utilizing a fixed downsampling operator to generate views of the data on different scales . This kind of inductive bias is simple to interpret and it appears to be a promising aid in model training . - The experimental section is extensive . The authors evaulate their approach on multiple problems , synthetic and real world . Especially the ablation study should be pointed out . - The ablation study aims to confirm the authors claims that the presented approach results in better mode capture . To do that the authors compare different model architectures , different training losses , and the multi-stage training to end-to-end training . Their results suggest that the multi-scale model trained in multiple stages using Jeffreys divergence indeed performs best . # Negatives - One of the biggest issues in this paper is the lack of clarity in places , which in turn makes the work hard to digest . This is often owed either to a poor choice of notation or to abbreviated explanations . Especially the methods section should be pointed out in this regard . I will give a few examples below . - In equation ( 1 ) the authors surrogate $ q ( x|y ) $ with $ q ( x ) $ . This choice makes it difficult to follow equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) as it is not clear anymore where we are dealing with marginal or conditional probabilities . - The use of $ \\rho ( x ) $ and $ L ( y|x ) $ does not follow the ICLR style guide for probabilities . - Section 2.1 is not clear . Here , the choice of abbreviations in ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) hinders an understanding . It is not made clear which role variable y plays in the network . It should be made more clear by the authors that the forward process of the multiscale model is sampling from the posterior distribution . - Figure 1 only shows the sampling process , but does not help to understand the training . $ \\tilde { x } _l $ is represented with smaller images than $ x_l $ although both have the same dimensionality . - Section 2.3 discusses biefly the use of Jeffreys divergence with importance sampling for training the model . The authors do not make clear what $ p ( x ) $ and $ q ( x ) $ stand for in this context . As such it is not possible to make out how to train the model with the suggested loss . - The prior conditioning layer ( upsampling layer ) exploits the fact that the downsampling operation is linear and the prior over fine-scale data is assumed to be a multivariate normal distribution . As such , the upsampling can be implemented with a linear function of the coarse data and a noise vector . It is well known that this kind of inversion , although analytically correct , is computationally infeasible in high dimensional data . The authors do not address this issue in their text . - With respect to the multi-scale structure of the model , the paper does not position itself well in the literature . Invertible models such as in Dinh et al . ( 2016 ) already use a multi-scale structure . The authors should point out the difference of their approach more explicitly . Using explicit downsampling as an inductive bias was used successfully before for training GANs in Denton et al . ( 2015 ) .This work might be a good starting point to discover other related multi-scale approaches . # Recommendations - Figure 1 could be improved to visualise the overall approach better . It would be worth visualising the sampling process for estimating Jeffreys divergence . Further , I would suggest to use an example from the Celeb A data set in order to get a better understanding of the intermediate scales . In addition , the downsampling operation $ \\mathcal { A } $ could be emphasided in this figure . - Notation should be improved and made more consistent . Is there a way to reduce the amount of variables used ? Is it possible to use consistent notation to denote probabilities ? - Section 2.1 should be clarified . Is there a simpler way to explain this ? For example by exploiting the Markov property of the model . # Questions - In Lemma 2.1 it is assumed that the fine-scale signal follows a multivariate normal distribution . Is this a reasonable assumption ? Does this not contradict the idea of multiple modes in the data ? - Figure 6 : Why do the interemediate coarser scale samples not look like downsampled versions of the high resolution image ? - What happens if the models on each scale are trained completely decoupled ? Would it be fair to call the model a stacked super-resolution model ? # References Ardizzone , L. , Kruse , J. , Wirkert , S. , Rahner , D. , Pellegrini , E. W. , Klessen , R. S. , & K\u00f6the , U .

I generally believe that the presented approach merits publication . The methodology is sound and the experiments are convincing . I appreciate the fact that the authors made an effort to improve the writing .", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Thank you for your detailed review , comments and suggestions . We 've updated our manuscript , especially for the methodology part , to increase the clarity of this work . # # # # Regarding the negatives : - $ q ( x ) $ vs $ q ( x|y ) $ : The measurement data $ y $ only takes the part of defining the target distribution $ q ( x|y ) $ in MsIGN , so we decided to drop it for notation simplicity . In fact , in other literatures in Bayesian inference problems like Moselhy et al. , ( 2012 ) and Chen et al. , ( 2019 ) , authors used a similar abbreviation to the target posterior distribution . We updated our wording to make this notation clearer to readers in the beginning of Section 2 . - Prior conditioning operator incomputable : The prior conditioning layer only needs to be computed once and will be fixed thereafter . Thus although sometimes the dimension gets too high and the inversion might be very expensive , it might still be acceptable given that we only needs to compute it once . Furthermore , if the dimension gets so high such that one-time evaluation is infeasible , we can consider performing low-rank approximation of the analytical solution . Though the prior conditioning operator is not exact , the following unit of invertible flow will correct this approximation by training . - Related work for the multi-scale design : Since we mainly focus on the task of Bayesian inference , in Section 3 we mainly listed related work for this task . We thank the reviewer for reminding us of the related works in image synthesis task , and have revised this section in the manuscript . The RealNVP model in Dinh et al. , ( 2016 ) and Glow model in Kingma & Dhariwal. , ( 2018 ) do used a multi-scale design , but the main difference is that 1 ) their multi-scale design doesn \u2019 t have spatial semantic meaning . The internal neuron gets a reduced of dimension , but this reduction has no spatial property . 2 ) Due to 1 ) , RealNVP and Glow can \u2019 t be trained in a multi-stage fashion , and generate samples in a coarse-to-fine manner . The GAN model in Denton et al. , ( 2015 ) is a generative adversial network that is not invertible , which is hard to do density evaluation . And therefore , the lack of invertibility in this models makes it difficult to be applied to the Bayesian inference problems . We appended more related work discussion in Section 3 . # # # # Regarding the questions - Assumption of the multi-variate normal distribution : In the image synthesis task , since we lack of the information of how the distribution of images looks like a priori , we assume the prior of the images to be a multi-variate normal distribution . This doesn \u2019 t contradict with the multi-modal nature of the data because it only enforces a prior ( and in practice a very weak one ) for the data . The prior helps us in building a prior conditioning distribution to guide us in refining a low-resolution image to a high-resolution one , and it won \u2019 t hurt the multi-modality . - Figure 6 : We use the model trained on low-resolution data to initialize the high-resolution model . Parameters from the low-resolution model will not be frozen in the following training , and therefore , the output at low-resolution stage might be different from that of the original low-resolution model . As shown in Figure 6 , they are most likely some linear mix of the original output along the color channel . We can still see that the spatial feature of the intermediate coarser scale samples resembles that of the finer scale samples . - Decoupled training and a stacked super-resolution model : For the image synthesis task , it is fair to call our model a stacked super-resolution model . In fact , we also report that given the data set of natural images , each scale of our model can be trained separately . However , we focus on solving Bayesian inverse problems using MsIGN , where true samples are not available in training . In this case , we can \u2019 t train each scale of MsIGN separately . For high- $ d $ Bayesian inverse problem with multiple modes , it is crucial to have the coarse-scale model in hand to optimize the Jeffreys divergence by importance sampling , and initialize the fine-scale model . In this sense , it may be appropriate to call our MsIGN a stacked super-resolution model . # # # # References El Moselhy , Tarek A. , and Youssef M.

The method itself is quite concise and beautiful in its simplicity ( a nice case of \u201c obvious once you see it \u201d ) , and looks rather simple to implement . The results are also rather promising . With that said , there are some steps that are lacking . Notably the results leave some things open ( e.g.the SotA-ness is highly debatable given more recent methods such as routing transformers ) and for the Bayesian inverse problems it \u2019 s hard to judge given that the only baselines are \u201c in house \u201d rather than externally defined . I also find the theoretical exposition to be a bit hard to follow , especially given the generous use of appendices .

It \u2019 s also not the most accessible example . * Spelling errors like dimebsion , groundtruth .

Why was this done ? * Table 2 is quite lacking , several SotA methods are not in there ( which makes this method not SotA ) .", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Thanks for your careful review and detailed comments . We 've updated our manuscript . Here are our reply to your comments : - The existence of a prior conditioning operator : When the distribution is odd , for example a singular distribution , the prior conditioning operator will exist but not be necessarily bijective or invertible . However , in Bayesian inference , the posterior distribution has a well-defined density in general . Besides , in those odd cases , we can still construct a prior conditioning operator that approximates the distribution well , rather than exactly captures it . This approximation will be refined by the following invertible flow unit . Theoretically not every distribution has a well-defined prior conditioning operator , but in the practice of Bayesian inference problems with multiscale structure , we expect this issue won \u2019 t be a trouble . - Optimization in Appendix D , repetition , spelling error , figures in vector format : We thank you very much for the suggestions . We \u2019 ve revised our manuscript accordingly . - \u201c $ q ( x ( s1 , s2 ) ) =q ( x ( s1 , 1-s2 ) ) $ \u201d does not imply multiple modes : Yes , \u201c $ q ( x ( s1 , s2 ) ) =q ( x ( s1 , 1-s2 ) ) $ \u201d is not a sufficient condition to the existence of multiple modes . This design only ensures that we will have a symmetric posterior distribution . To construct a posterior with multiple modes , we need to carefully choose the hyper-parameter $ \\alpha $ , $ \\beta $ , $ \\sigma_\\varepsilon $ , as well as the measurement functions $ \\varphi $ , and the force term $ f $ . To certify the multi-modality , we run multiple gradient ascent searching of the posterior , starting from different initial points . We observe that they all converge to two mutually symmetric points $ \\mathbf { x } ^ * $ and $ \\tilde { \\mathbf { x } } ^ * $ . We also visualize the 1D landscape profile of the posterior q on the line passing through $ \\mathbf { x } ^ * $ and $ \\tilde { \\mathbf { x } } ^ * $ . The profile also shows a clear double-modal feature . We appended more necessary details in our manuscript , see Section 4.1 and Appendix E. - Showing the worst of 3 : For Figure 2 ( a ) , we repeat the experiment for 3 times for robustness purpose . Different runs ( of a same method ) may capture different mode , and thus can be difficult or confusing to visualize . Therefore based on this consideration we only plot 1 out of these 3 runs , and our choice is the the worst of these 3 . - SOTA claim and Table 2 : Yes , it may be inadequate to claim the SOTA among all solutions to the image synthesis task . However , to our knowledge , MsIGN gives the best bit-per-dimension value among flow-based generative models . Besides , Routing transformer is an auto-regressive model and has much more number of parameters than ours ( 80M vs 33M for the ImageNet-64 data set ) . We also remark that the main focus of MsIGN is to solve the Bayesian inference problems here . We revised our wording to `` achieves superior performance in bits-per-dimension among our baseline models , like Glow ( Kingma & Prafulla. , 2018 ) , FFJORD ( Grathwohl et al. , 2018 ) , Flow++ ( Ho et al. , 2019 ) , i-ResNet ( Behrmann et al. , 2019 ) , and Residual Flow ( Chen et al. , 2019 ) '' in the updated version . # # # # References Kingma , Durk P. , and Prafulla Dhariwal . `` Glow : Generative flow with invertible 1x1 convolutions .

I do not see this paper accepted the way it is , but it might be true that a person more expert in flow-based models and inference than me thinks completely the opposite .", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Thank you for your honest comment . Our work targets at the Bayesian inference problems , where we want to generate samples from a distribution , given its unnormalized density . Such problem is very challenging when the sample dimension is high and when there are multiple modes in the distribution . Our MsIGN proposes a way to detect multiple modes and approximate the target distribution when the problem demonstrates certain multiscale structure , even if the dimension is rather high . Now we 've updated our manuscript to enhance its clarity . Meanwhile , we will be very glad to discuss your questions and concerns ."}, "2": {"review_id": "RdhjoXl-SDG-2", "review_text": "The authors propose a multi-scale method to design invertible network and apply it to bayesian inverse problems . The method itself is quite concise and beautiful in its simplicity ( a nice case of \u201c obvious once you see it \u201d ) , and looks rather simple to implement . The results are also rather promising . With that said , there are some steps that are lacking . Notably the results leave some things open ( e.g.the SotA-ness is highly debatable given more recent methods such as routing transformers ) and for the Bayesian inverse problems it \u2019 s hard to judge given that the only baselines are \u201c in house \u201d rather than externally defined . I also find the theoretical exposition to be a bit hard to follow , especially given the generous use of appendices . I have some further comments : * The existence of a prior conditioning operator in the general case seems somewhat debatable ( consider odd cases like singular distributions , distributions with weird topologies and discrete distributions ) , I \u2019 m quite sure you need at least some further conditions . I \u2019 d also be fine with a \u201c if it exists \u201d style statement . * The optimisation described in appendix D is quite critical to the method as is ( especially since using Jeffreys divergence is even mentioned in the abstract as a main point ) and should be in the body of the article . * The statement \u201c the subsurface flow simulation at the scale of meters approximates well the simulation at the scale of centimeters \u201d is more or less repeated twice verbatim . It \u2019 s also not the most accessible example . * Spelling errors like dimebsion , groundtruth . Overall the language could use some polishing throughout the article . * All figures should be in vector format * The statement \u201c q ( x ( s1 , s2 ) ) = q ( x ( s1 , 1 \u2212 s2 ) ) \u201d does not afaik imply more than one mode , consider e.g.a mode centered at s2=0.5 . * Showing the \u201c worst of 3 \u201d seems rather dishonest . Why was this done ? * Table 2 is quite lacking , several SotA methods are not in there ( which makes this method not SotA ) .", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Thanks for your careful review and detailed comments . We 've updated our manuscript . Here are our reply to your comments : - The existence of a prior conditioning operator : When the distribution is odd , for example a singular distribution , the prior conditioning operator will exist but not be necessarily bijective or invertible . However , in Bayesian inference , the posterior distribution has a well-defined density in general . Besides , in those odd cases , we can still construct a prior conditioning operator that approximates the distribution well , rather than exactly captures it . This approximation will be refined by the following invertible flow unit . Theoretically not every distribution has a well-defined prior conditioning operator , but in the practice of Bayesian inference problems with multiscale structure , we expect this issue won \u2019 t be a trouble . - Optimization in Appendix D , repetition , spelling error , figures in vector format : We thank you very much for the suggestions . We \u2019 ve revised our manuscript accordingly . - \u201c $ q ( x ( s1 , s2 ) ) =q ( x ( s1 , 1-s2 ) ) $ \u201d does not imply multiple modes : Yes , \u201c $ q ( x ( s1 , s2 ) ) =q ( x ( s1 , 1-s2 ) ) $ \u201d is not a sufficient condition to the existence of multiple modes . This design only ensures that we will have a symmetric posterior distribution . To construct a posterior with multiple modes , we need to carefully choose the hyper-parameter $ \\alpha $ , $ \\beta $ , $ \\sigma_\\varepsilon $ , as well as the measurement functions $ \\varphi $ , and the force term $ f $ . To certify the multi-modality , we run multiple gradient ascent searching of the posterior , starting from different initial points . We observe that they all converge to two mutually symmetric points $ \\mathbf { x } ^ * $ and $ \\tilde { \\mathbf { x } } ^ * $ . We also visualize the 1D landscape profile of the posterior q on the line passing through $ \\mathbf { x } ^ * $ and $ \\tilde { \\mathbf { x } } ^ * $ . The profile also shows a clear double-modal feature . We appended more necessary details in our manuscript , see Section 4.1 and Appendix E. - Showing the worst of 3 : For Figure 2 ( a ) , we repeat the experiment for 3 times for robustness purpose . Different runs ( of a same method ) may capture different mode , and thus can be difficult or confusing to visualize . Therefore based on this consideration we only plot 1 out of these 3 runs , and our choice is the the worst of these 3 . - SOTA claim and Table 2 : Yes , it may be inadequate to claim the SOTA among all solutions to the image synthesis task . However , to our knowledge , MsIGN gives the best bit-per-dimension value among flow-based generative models . Besides , Routing transformer is an auto-regressive model and has much more number of parameters than ours ( 80M vs 33M for the ImageNet-64 data set ) . We also remark that the main focus of MsIGN is to solve the Bayesian inference problems here . We revised our wording to `` achieves superior performance in bits-per-dimension among our baseline models , like Glow ( Kingma & Prafulla. , 2018 ) , FFJORD ( Grathwohl et al. , 2018 ) , Flow++ ( Ho et al. , 2019 ) , i-ResNet ( Behrmann et al. , 2019 ) , and Residual Flow ( Chen et al. , 2019 ) '' in the updated version . # # # # References Kingma , Durk P. , and Prafulla Dhariwal . `` Glow : Generative flow with invertible 1x1 convolutions .
