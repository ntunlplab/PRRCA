There are many previous studies on quantizing gradients for efficient distributed training , such as QSGD [ 1 ] and signSGD [ 2 ] . Although most of those studies do not reduce the computational complexity for backpropagation , they still serve as well-performed gradient quantitation methods .

Real hardware design ( e.g.GPU architecture ) requires a global floating representation across all datasets so it is impossible to design hardware with a specific floating representation for a specific dataset . Therefore , I do n't think determining the best floating-point format for each dataset is useful in practice . 4.Also I would like to address some technical questions regarding the setting and experiment : a . How does weight update work with the quantized gradient ? Do you perform the quantized gradient over the full-precision weight ? b.What kind of optimizer you used for the experiments ? c. How do you handle the precision of the error term ( defined in WAGE paper [ 3 ] ) ?

The bandwidth and memory footprint is reduced since in the backpropagation process , all the intermediate calculation are saved in the device memory before the calculation of next layers ( usually cache memory ca n't contain all these intermediate calculation and it needs to be transfered to the SRAM ) .

Nevertheless , our simulations show a considerable overlap between different data sets , which allows defining a single bit allocation representation that can target several data sets simultaneously ( e.g. , the ideal sign-exponent-mantissa bit allocations for the FP8 format is 1-5-2 for both CIFAR100 and ImageNet ) . Moreover , even without this overlap , since we still have to choose some format for the hardware device , we believe it is useful to know which formats would be most beneficial for which combinations of precision/dataset/model . Lastly , our analysis can also be useful the other way around . Given a pre-defined sign-exponent-mantissa bit allocation , we can find the best dynamic range ( i.e. , $ \\sigma $ ) for the gradients ' operation . With that in mind , future work can study how gradients can be brought to this operating point ( e.g. , by manipulating training hyperparameters , such as the learning-rate ) , hence minimizing the quantization noise for an already specified floating-point format . 4 ) As we explained in ( 1 ) above , in this work we focus on quantization/pruning of neural gradients rather than weight gradient ( as is done in QSGD and signSGD ) .

From the central limit theorem , normal distributions universally arise from the sum of many random variables , while lognormal distributions universally arise as the product of many random variables . This might suggest that , as we backpropgate the neural gradients through the network , these gradients have a few dominant paths , so most significant operations are products , rather than summations ( i.e. , so along these paths : effective depth > > effective width ) . However , we suspect this might be only a part of a more nuanced picture . 2 ) In order to show that the loglaplace distribution assumption yields worse results in quantization , we added Fig A.1.b to the appendix showing the FP format obtained by solving Eq.3 with loglaplace distribution ( Similar to Fig3b and Fig3c ) . Notice this leads to sub-optimal format - for example in Cifar100 FP6 format , loglaplace assumption leads to 1-5-0 as the optimal format , which is sub-optimal as shown in Table 3 . 3 ) The overhead of the proposed method in pruning is very small , as we elaborated in section A.7 we calculate the threshold only once per epoch , and even then , this adds less than 5 { \\ % } to that single iteration .

Can the authors provide any intuition as to why a log normal might be better ? * Clearly for pruning , logNormal distribution seems to work better than logLaplace . It \u2019 d be interesting to see the results of using LogLaplace distribution for quantization and verify that it yields worse results there too . * Can the authors elaborate on time/memory complexity , and how well their methods made improvements for training time ?", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "reply_text": "1 ) This is a very interesting question , but we so far we did not find a simple or `` intuitive '' answer . From the central limit theorem , normal distributions universally arise from the sum of many random variables , while lognormal distributions universally arise as the product of many random variables . This might suggest that , as we backpropgate the neural gradients through the network , these gradients have a few dominant paths , so most significant operations are products , rather than summations ( i.e. , so along these paths : effective depth > > effective width ) . However , we suspect this might be only a part of a more nuanced picture . 2 ) In order to show that the loglaplace distribution assumption yields worse results in quantization , we added Fig A.1.b to the appendix showing the FP format obtained by solving Eq.3 with loglaplace distribution ( Similar to Fig3b and Fig3c ) . Notice this leads to sub-optimal format - for example in Cifar100 FP6 format , loglaplace assumption leads to 1-5-0 as the optimal format , which is sub-optimal as shown in Table 3 . 3 ) The overhead of the proposed method in pruning is very small , as we elaborated in section A.7 we calculate the threshold only once per epoch , and even then , this adds less than 5 { \\ % } to that single iteration . In all other iterations , the overhead is negligible . We noticed a similar overhead to find the per-layer scaling for quantization . In total , both methods add minimal overhead to the training process . The compression of the neural gradients reduce the bandwidth , memory footprint and computational time . The bandwidth and memory footprint is reduced since in the backpropagation process , all the intermediate calculation are saved in the device memory before the calculation of next layers ( usually cache memory can \u2019 t contain all these intermediate calculation and it needs to be transfered to the SRAM ) . Additionally , in distributed training of model parallelism , the neural gradients may form a bottleneck , as these gradients are required to1 transfer across devices . Computational effort is also reduced , since the neural gradients are part of the calculation of next layer and weight gradients at backpropagation"}}
