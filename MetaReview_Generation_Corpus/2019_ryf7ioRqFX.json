However, similar methods like BN-LSTM [3] and Variational RNNs [4] achieve arguably the same with very similar mechanisms. We do not think they can be considered as orthogonal. This should be addressed by the authors. Also, hard long-term experiments like sequentially predicting pixels (like through MDLSTM-based PixelRNN) or language modelling should be favoured over short sentence image captions. It is possible that we will improve our ratings once our concerns are addressed. Paper Summary: The authors claim that the gradient along the computational path that goes through the cell state (the linear temporal path or A gradient) of an LSTM carries information about long-term dependencies. Those gradients can be corrupted by the gradient of all other computational paths (i.e. the B gradient). They claim that this makes it hard to learn long-term dependencies and has, therefore, significant negative effects on the convergence speed, training stability, and generalisation performance. They propose a method called h-detach and run experiments on the delayed copy task, sequential MNIST, permuted sequential MNIST (pMNIST), and caption generation on the MS COCO dataset. All show either somewhat improved performance or much more stable learning curves. At every step, h-detach randomly drops all gradients that flow through the h of the standard LSTM, the B gradients, and only keeps the ones from the linear temporal path, the A gradients. Experiments also suggest that the A gradients carry more long-term information than B gradients and that LSTMs with h-detach do not need gradient clipping for successful training. Positive: The paper is written clearly. It is well structured and well motivated. H-detach is simple, effective, and somewhat novel (see below). Experiments indicate that its main benefit is training stability as well as minor performance improvements. Negative: We are not sure how significant these results are for the following reasons: - MS COCO image caption generation is the only more challenging dataset, but it seems a bit misplaced as it has very short sentences, while the authors motivate their work through a focus on long-term dependencies. Why not apply h-detach to a language model such as [1] with official online implementations, e.g., [2]. A setting with PixelRNN [6] based on MD-LSTM [7] would also be a great testbed for h-detach. - The purpose of h-detach is to scale down the B gradients. However, methods which apply e.g. BatchNorm to the hidden state learn a scale parameter which could be learned by the network explicitly. For the backward pass, this has the effect of scaling down the B gradient. Consider e.g. [3] which also achieves similar training stability on sequential MNIST and pMNIST with little overhead. - Another very related method is [4] which properly applies a random dropout mask over the recurrent inputs that is shared across timesteps of an RNN. We think that h-detach is essentially achieving the same in a similar way. Problems with Introduction and Related Work Section: - The vanishing gradient problem was first described by Hochreiter in 1991 [5] (not by Bengio in 1994). - Intro mentions GRU as if it was separate from LSTM. Clarify that GRU is essentially a variant of vanilla LSTM with forget gates [8]. Since one gate is missing, GRU is less powerful than the original LSTM [9].

The goal is to facilitate gradient propagation along cell states, or the \"linear temporal path\". It blocks the gradient propagation of hidden states with a probability of $1-p$ independently. The proposed method is evaluated on the copying task, sequential MNIST task, and image captioning tasks. The performance is sightly boosted on those tasks. The paper is well-written. The h-detach method is very simple and easy to implement. It seems novel in dealing with the trainability issue with recurrent networks.

However, the reviewer thinks the paper is not sufficiently motivated and the quality of the paper could be further improved by conducting a more thorough analysis of the proposed method, and discussing the connection with other existing methods. As the motivation of the work, the authors seem to claim that if the magnitude of $B_t$ is much bigger that $A_t$, then the backpropagation will be problematic. Is there any theoretical or empirical support of this claim? In order to damp the gradient component of $B_t$, it does not have to be stochastic. Can we simply multiply the matrix $B_t$ by a constant factor $p$ during backpropagation? Or regularize the weights $W_{*h}$ to be small so that $\\phi_t$ and $\\tilde\\phi_t$ are small? It would be interesting to study the effect of the probability $p$ and to suggest an \"optimal\" choice of $p$, either theoretically or empirically. Is it still possible to train the model with a very small $p$? The h-detach method seems to have a flavor of dropout, but the \"dropout\" only happens during backpropagation. The design goal also resembles the peephole LSTM, that is to disentangle the cell state and the hidden state. Is there any possible connections between the proposed method and the dropout and peephole LSTM?
