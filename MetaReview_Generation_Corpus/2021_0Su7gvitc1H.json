After reminding the basics of Bayesian estimation and MCMC , Section 2 finishes with the description of the contact dynamic model .

In particular , there is mention of a needle after Eq 10 , the purpose of which we only understand 3 pages later . 2.Related work Only one other algorithm is compared with the one proposed ( RLS ) it seems to me that related work has been overlooked . - please discuss how ARMCMC differs from RJMCMC ( Reversible Jump MCMC ) , where we could jump between model 1 ( no contact ) and model 2 ( contact ) back and forth . * * The authors answered that comment a bit quickly , in my opinion , as RJMCMC has been applied to a change-point problem in the original paper , which seems to be similar to the one presented in the paper . However , their argument on realtime is valid . * * - also , how does the proposed algorithm relate to the following ones ? o `` Particle filters for non-Gaussian hunt-crossley model of environment in bilateral teleoperation '' , Agand et al ( 2016 ) , which is cited for other reasons o `` Neural Network Control of a Robot Interacting With an Uncertain Hunt-Crossley Viscoelastic Environment '' , Bhasin et al ( 2008 ) o `` Exact restitution and generalizations for the Hunt\u2013Crossley contact model '' , Carvalho and Martins ( 2019 ) * * The authors agree that the work mentioned propose different approaches to the same model , but do not compare these approaches to the one they proposed in their experiment , and do not give enough details as to why . * * 3.Minimum number of evaluations Figure 1 shows an evaluation of the minimum number of evaluations depending on the values of the parameters : - how come there are values lower than 1 ? - In practice , was $ k $ round up from $ k_ { min } $ ? - is it in purpose that it is called $ k_ { min } $ in Eq 17 and Figure 1 , and $ k_ { max } $ in Algorithm 1 ? * * The authors answered all the questions related to $ k_ { min } $ , and it is now clearer . * * 4.Empirical results - The setting of the experiment is not specified : which material was used ?

Why not use RMS everywhere ? Does that mean that there are some points that are strongly over- or under-estimated ? Or is it because of the lag ( see comment below ) ? - In Figure 3 : o how come the lag for the absence of contact is so important with ARMCMC , while there is almost no lag for the beginning of contact ? is it because of the temporal factor ? o Can you comment on why the RLS looks so unstable ? o also , which of the 2 versions of ARMCMC is presented here ? APS or MAPS ? o Why is there no comparison with MCMC in Figure 3 , whereas it appears in all other results ? - Figure 4 is rather hard to read : please consider using doted/dashed lines and possibly markers to distinguish better between the estimators - There is mention in the introduction and in Section 2 that RLS requires some restrictive conditions : o are they not realistic in practice ? o it would be interesting to see a case where those conditions are not met , showing the strength of the proposed algorithm # # # Question Do the parameters for viscosity and elasticity of a material vary in time ?

For a submission to a conference in ... - * * Authors \u2019 Response : * * 1 . Although we need to talk minimally on basic MCMC , it is still required to declare some notations for consistency . Also , ARMCM is an extension of MCMC which requires whole notation and parameters in hand . In the revised version , we try to provide more detailed explanation for the novel part . 2.We devoted Sec 2.4 for contact dynamic model as preliminaries , and discuss it in more detail in Sec 4 . We add a sentence in Sec 2.4 to bridge the gap between two sections . 3.We add another test study to enrich our comparison . 4.Thanks for the comment . RJMCMC tries to handle multiple model selection , however , ARMCMC tries to propose an realtime implication proposing facilitator variables to determine the current stage of the underlying dynamic . A sentence added to the introduction of the revised paper . 5.The first one ( Agand et al , 2016 ) propose another approach to estimate/control the Hunt-Crossley model . Bhasin et al ( 2008 ) and Carvalho et al ( 2019 ) are also added to the reference list to enrich bibliography . 6.Nice catch . The figure was not cropped properly . The $ y-axis $ has $ \\times 10^4 $ 7 . Yes , we choose the value of $ K $ to be equal to $ K_ { min } $ 8 . It was a typo on Algorithm 1 . Thanks for noticing . $ K_ { max } $ is limited according to hardware specification . 9.The empirical results is based on a model-based dynamic of a needle in contact to a soft tissue . Based on ( Abolhassani et al. , 2007 ) this model is very accurate . However , for the model , we only consider the Hunt-Crossley dynamic and all the other parts considered as unmodeled dynamic and uncertainty . 10.Due to the space limitation , we have not implement EM . So we decide to put it in future works . 11.RMS is the best measurement of error in Gaussian noise . In other cases , as we have in this example , we try to show other metrics like MAE that show more improvement in error . That could be because of strong over/under estimation of RLS . However for force , since there are different source of uncertainty , we use RMS . 12.According to the timeline ( Fig 1 of revised manuscript ) , there is always a two algorithm time step delay ( here 0.2sec ) for ARMCMC . The reason why absence of contact is more severe , is that even when there is no contact , due to measured noise or disturbances , the Hunt-Crossley model is still valid and the model mismatch index does not alter . However , if there is no force , as the needle reaches the soft contact , the forces grows and Hunt-Crossley model would be chosen . 13.There is no note for RLS in case of model change . Therefore , as the parameter converge , the covariance matrix in RLS starts to decrease , making the Kalman gain minimum . By abrupt change in the dynamic , the current covariance matrix can not handle this situation . An easy fix for this could be periodic covariance resetting , which will mitigate the overal performance of the RLS during normal cases . 14.All the figures and reported variables are for AR-MAPS . Just the corresponding row in Table 1 is AR-APS . 15.Because it does not have good performance and deteriorate the visual level of the figures . The figure would be too messy and inconclusive . 16.Done 17.The Hunt-Crossley model and all hybrid systems are practical systems which does not satisfy the RLS restrictive assumptions . Moreover , Gaussian noise is not always the case , as in impulsive noise . 18.If the RLS conditions satisfies , it would have better results compare to any other suboptimal approach . However , in case of not LIP/Guassion , PE the results would degenerate , as we can see in the two proposed example . - * * Comment : * * * Question * Do the parameters for viscosity ... - * * Authors \u2019 Response : * * The answer to this question is that technically they can change , by varying their chemical/mechanical behaviour . Meanwhile , the problem here is * abrupt * change of parameters ( like for hybrid models ) as slow changes can be targeted by simple RLS with forgetting factor .

Despite its simple elegance , i.e. , the introduction of a data-driven _temporal forgetting factor_ into the usual Metropolis-Hastings algorithm , the approach is , to my knowledge , novel . Its discovery seems to be the result of the intersection between fields : system identification and Bayesian sampling techniques , leading to new bridges . In fact , novelty and interdisciplinarity are the strong points of this paper , but mostly everything else is compromised due to a severe lack of clarity . Although Section 1 is clear and fulfills its role of contextualizing the paper well , from Section 2 onward the a ) organization , b ) notation , c ) technical inaccuracies in writing , and d ) lack of detail on the application make the paper hard to read . To give just one example in each category : a ) a major change in the usual MCMC scheme is explained in ( and only in ) _Remark 2_ , Section 2.1 , which is supposed to be part of the preliminaries on MCMC , b ) the number of different notations for the collected data is ludicrous , and they are impossible to distinguish , c ) $ P_k $ in $ ( 9 ) $ is not a probability density function ( PDF ) , simply a sample of the MCMC algorithm , and d ) Section 2.4 is confusing because $ p $ and $ n $ are sometimes interchanged , no contextualizing figure is provided , assumptions are not interpreted , etc . I recommend to reject this paper , but only because I believe it should be rewritten to be exposed clearly . Although the contribution is worthwhile , the paper is confusing and misleading . I am open to changing my recommendation if the authors introduce major changes in the presentation , writing , and structure , while still presenting the same content . Among writing inaccuracies , using the term `` density estimation '' in the title of the paper is among the worse . Any Bayesian approach obtains a posterior distribution ( explicitly or implicitly ) , but this is not the same problem as estimating the probability distribution of some given data . The following questions point to some of the key problems I have found in the paper , without any specific order : * Have the authors evaluated the assumption that the Gaussian model for noise is sufficiently robust for the application even when other noise models are used for the empirical results ? * Could the authors define the times at which the algorithm is run and the times at which data is collected ? as well as the relation between them ? A simple , intuitive , and correct notation for the data is needed . That could be the first step towards obtaining it . * Could the authors clarify in which sense the minimum number of data points is restricted ( not confined ) by the fact that the algorithm is aiming at real-time operation ? * Could the authors clarify the role of $ \\rho $ ? It is mentioned in _Remark 2_ and does not seem to appear again . * Could the authors give some hints to the readers on how the expectation-maximization algorithm is used for delay compensation ? This would greatly aid reproducibility . * Could the authors explain what is , and discuss the results of , AR-MAPS in Table 1 ? * Could the authors use clearer measures of improvement than percentages of improvement ? These are ill-defined and it is hard to pin which percentages are being reported . * Is the resulting posterior as informative when the parameters are zero because the needle is not in contact with the soft surface ? Could the vertical axes in Figure 2 be expanded to explore that ? * Could the authors clarify in which sense their simulated data is realistic ? The appendix is quite uninformative to non-experts in the application . Suggestions to improve the paper - not specifically related to my recommendation : * Thoroughly revise the use of English : some sentences are missing key components . * Emphasize and clarify throughout the paper the role of the _temporal forgetting factor_ , and the fact that it is not simply a user-defined constant , but a function of the observed model mismatch : this can be confusing to those that are not used to the concept . * Use the entire available horizontal space in Figures 2 , 3 and 4 : it will help visualize some of the key features and look better . * Use transparency for the line plots in Figures 3 and 4 : it will allow to see their individual behavior better . * Resize the fonts in all plots to match the size of the Figure captions : this will make them much easier to read . * Correct the references ( capitalization , etc . ) , e.g. , Hunt-Crossley vs hunt-crossley in ( Haddadi , Hashtrudi-Zaad , 2012 ) .", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "- * * Comment : * * 1. a major change in the usual MCMC scheme is ... 2. the number of different notations ... 3 . $ P_k $ in ( 9 ) is not a ... 4 . Section 2.4 is confusing ... - * * Authors \u2019 Response : * * Thanks for the comment . We try to address all issues throughout the paper , here are some examples : 1 . Remark 2 is a usual trick to avoid numerical instability . Considering the importance of comparing latest data pack with the previous data pack , we originally presented this in the preliminaries part . In the revision , we moved this content to the algorithm section . 2.Revised.A timeline is also added to make it more clear . 3.Corrected . 4.Corrected . - * * Comment : * * The following questions point to some of the key problems I have found in the paper , without any specific order : ... - * * Authors \u2019 Response : * * We have changed the title to \u201c ARMCMC : Online Model Parameters full probability Estimation in Bayesian Paradigm \u201d . 1.It is true that according to central limit theorem , infinite sum of different noise would be Gaussian ; however , impulse noise is a common source of uncertainty which can not be modeled as a Gaussian . So the answer to this question would be , although there are some practical examples in which Gaussian noise can not model the uncertainty in the system , it is still crucial to have some general approach like ARMCMC for applications like online force prediction for robotics manipulators interacting with an environment . 2.To answer this question , we decided to draw a timeline for the algorithm/data interval in Fig.1 of the revised manuscript . 3.The minimum required evaluation is restricted to guarantee the algorithm achieve the desire precision and reliability . While its maximum is confined to assure the evaluation can be done in the dedicated time slot due to hardware limitation . For the first example , given $ \\lambda = 0.7 , \\epsilon = 0.01 , \\delta = 0.9 $ to compute the minimum and hardware specification to compute maximum , we have $ $ K_ { min } =6000 \\leq K \\leq K_ { max } \\approx 8000 $ $ 4 . $ \\rho $ reflects volatility of the model parameters . For systems with fast-pacing parameters , $ \\rho $ should take larger values . It has also added to the revised paper . 5.Due to the space limitation , we have not implement that . So we decide to put it in future works . 6.This is directly from the paper : \u201c The point estimation obtained by considering the mode at modification phase and medium during reinforcement in ARMCMC is denoted as AR-MAPS. \u201d In other words , when the probability distribution of parameters are not dense enough ( which would happen during modification phase ) , we choose the mode other than medium . While as the parameter probability get less dispersed , we choose the mean of particles as the point estimate . The results in Table 1 shows AR-MAPS shows better performance in point estimates while the underlying method for this and AR-APS are exactly the same . That is the reason authors think this can not necessarily a good measure to evaluate the performance of ARMCMC . The real priority of this method would be fulfilled when it is combined with probabilistic robust approaches , to have a complete decision making on a probabilistic era . 7.MAE and RMS are the most standard ways to report the error . We use percentage to present relative not absolute improvement . 70 % improvement is the minimum improvement among three parameters and 55 % is the improvement in the probability of interest ( here the force ) . 8.Yes , As the system lose its contact with the environment , we put the parameters equal to zero as an informative . However , we do not know when the contact would be lost , this would be calculated by computing the model mismatch index . We did not expand that figure to show the zero , cause it would be less noticeable to distinguish between other variables around the true value . 9.The empirical results is based on a model-based dynamic of a needle in contact to a soft tissue . Based on ( Abolhassani et al. , 2007 ) , this model provide a meticulous model of the contact . We use this to synthetic the data for simulation . However , for the model , we only consider the Hunt-Crossley model and all the other parts considered as unmodeled dynamic and uncertainty . - * * Comment : * * Suggestions to improve the paper - not specifically related to my recommendation : ... - * * Authors \u2019 Response : * * 1 .

However , their argument on realtime is valid . * * - also , how does the proposed algorithm relate to the following ones ? o `` Particle filters for non-Gaussian hunt-crossley model of environment in bilateral teleoperation '' , Agand et al ( 2016 ) , which is cited for other reasons o `` Neural Network Control of a Robot Interacting With an Uncertain Hunt-Crossley Viscoelastic Environment '' , Bhasin et al ( 2008 ) o `` Exact restitution and generalizations for the Hunt\u2013Crossley contact model '' , Carvalho and Martins ( 2019 ) * * The authors agree that the work mentioned propose different approaches to the same model , but do not compare these approaches to the one they proposed in their experiment , and do not give enough details as to why . * * 3.Minimum number of evaluations Figure 1 shows an evaluation of the minimum number of evaluations depending on the values of the parameters : - how come there are values lower than 1 ? - In practice , was $ k $ round up from $ k_ { min } $ ? - is it in purpose that it is called $ k_ { min } $ in Eq 17 and Figure 1 , and $ k_ { max } $ in Algorithm 1 ? * * The authors answered all the questions related to $ k_ { min } $ , and it is now clearer . * * 4.Empirical results - The setting of the experiment is not specified : which material was used ? Or was it synthetic data ? - There is a mention of results without EM at the end of section 4.1 , but are there any WITH EM , and if not why is it so ? - In Table 1 , why use different metrics for the parameters and for $ F_e $ ? Why not use RMS everywhere ? Does that mean that there are some points that are strongly over- or under-estimated ? Or is it because of the lag ( see comment below ) ? - In Figure 3 : o how come the lag for the absence of contact is so important with ARMCMC , while there is almost no lag for the beginning of contact ? is it because of the temporal factor ? o Can you comment on why the RLS looks so unstable ? o also , which of the 2 versions of ARMCMC is presented here ? APS or MAPS ? o Why is there no comparison with MCMC in Figure 3 , whereas it appears in all other results ? - Figure 4 is rather hard to read : please consider using doted/dashed lines and possibly markers to distinguish better between the estimators - There is mention in the introduction and in Section 2 that RLS requires some restrictive conditions : o are they not realistic in practice ? o it would be interesting to see a case where those conditions are not met , showing the strength of the proposed algorithm # # # Question Do the parameters for viscosity and elasticity of a material vary in time ? Is it really important to keep estimating them in real time , or ca n't they just be updated once in a while ? # # # Minor comments - Eq.8 and 9 , please replace the implication sign by a sentence for better readibility . - In section 2.4 , 2nd line : put the reference of Haddadi and Hashtrudi-Zaad in parenthesis to improve readibility . - After Eq.10 , the third parameter is designed by $ n $ instead of $ p $ . - After Eq 11 , the acronym RLS is not defined : I had to go see the reference to see that the R stands for recursive , and not reweighted e.g.- Eq.19 mentions the variables $ \\delta_2 $ and $ \\delta_0 $ , but there are no $ \\delta_1 $ anywhere . - Please increase the fontsize of the axis and legends in Figures 2 to 4 . - * * Typo `` apllicable '' on page 2 * * # # # Overall evaluation While the topic and the approach are interesting , I believe the state of the art has not been discussed sufficiently . If some of the suggested work indeed relate to the proposed one , they should be included in the experiment for comparison . * * After rebuttal , I think the authors did a good job in clarifying some points and adding an example in the experiment , which is why I upgrade the score I gave . However , I do n't understand why they do n't compare in the experiment with some of the methods from the cited literature concerned with the same model , especially Diolaiti et al.

Also , ARMCM is an extension of MCMC which requires whole notation and parameters in hand . In the revised version , we try to provide more detailed explanation for the novel part . 2.We devoted Sec 2.4 for contact dynamic model as preliminaries , and discuss it in more detail in Sec 4 . We add a sentence in Sec 2.4 to bridge the gap between two sections . 3.We add another test study to enrich our comparison . 4.Thanks for the comment . RJMCMC tries to handle multiple model selection , however , ARMCMC tries to propose an realtime implication proposing facilitator variables to determine the current stage of the underlying dynamic . A sentence added to the introduction of the revised paper . 5.The first one ( Agand et al , 2016 ) propose another approach to estimate/control the Hunt-Crossley model . Bhasin et al ( 2008 ) and Carvalho et al ( 2019 ) are also added to the reference list to enrich bibliography . 6.Nice catch . The figure was not cropped properly . The $ y-axis $ has $ \\times 10^4 $ 7 . Yes , we choose the value of $ K $ to be equal to $ K_ { min } $ 8 . It was a typo on Algorithm 1 . Thanks for noticing . $ K_ { max } $ is limited according to hardware specification . 9.The empirical results is based on a model-based dynamic of a needle in contact to a soft tissue . Based on ( Abolhassani et al. , 2007 ) this model is very accurate . However , for the model , we only consider the Hunt-Crossley dynamic and all the other parts considered as unmodeled dynamic and uncertainty . 10.Due to the space limitation , we have not implement EM . So we decide to put it in future works . 11.RMS is the best measurement of error in Gaussian noise . In other cases , as we have in this example , we try to show other metrics like MAE that show more improvement in error . That could be because of strong over/under estimation of RLS . However for force , since there are different source of uncertainty , we use RMS . 12.According to the timeline ( Fig 1 of revised manuscript ) , there is always a two algorithm time step delay ( here 0.2sec ) for ARMCMC . The reason why absence of contact is more severe , is that even when there is no contact , due to measured noise or disturbances , the Hunt-Crossley model is still valid and the model mismatch index does not alter . However , if there is no force , as the needle reaches the soft contact , the forces grows and Hunt-Crossley model would be chosen . 13.There is no note for RLS in case of model change . Therefore , as the parameter converge , the covariance matrix in RLS starts to decrease , making the Kalman gain minimum . By abrupt change in the dynamic , the current covariance matrix can not handle this situation . An easy fix for this could be periodic covariance resetting , which will mitigate the overal performance of the RLS during normal cases . 14.All the figures and reported variables are for AR-MAPS . Just the corresponding row in Table 1 is AR-APS . 15.Because it does not have good performance and deteriorate the visual level of the figures . The figure would be too messy and inconclusive . 16.Done 17.The Hunt-Crossley model and all hybrid systems are practical systems which does not satisfy the RLS restrictive assumptions . Moreover , Gaussian noise is not always the case , as in impulsive noise . 18.If the RLS conditions satisfies , it would have better results compare to any other suboptimal approach . However , in case of not LIP/Guassion , PE the results would degenerate , as we can see in the two proposed example . - * * Comment : * * * Question * Do the parameters for viscosity ... - * * Authors \u2019 Response : * * The answer to this question is that technically they can change , by varying their chemical/mechanical behaviour . Meanwhile , the problem here is * abrupt * change of parameters ( like for hybrid models ) as slow changes can be targeted by simple RLS with forgetting factor .

Despite its simple elegance , i.e. , the introduction of a data-driven _temporal forgetting factor_ into the usual Metropolis-Hastings algorithm , the approach is , to my knowledge , novel . Its discovery seems to be the result of the intersection between fields : system identification and Bayesian sampling techniques , leading to new bridges . In fact , novelty and interdisciplinarity are the strong points of this paper , but mostly everything else is compromised due to a severe lack of clarity . Although Section 1 is clear and fulfills its role of contextualizing the paper well , from Section 2 onward the a ) organization , b ) notation , c ) technical inaccuracies in writing , and d ) lack of detail on the application make the paper hard to read . To give just one example in each category : a ) a major change in the usual MCMC scheme is explained in ( and only in ) _Remark 2_ , Section 2.1 , which is supposed to be part of the preliminaries on MCMC , b ) the number of different notations for the collected data is ludicrous , and they are impossible to distinguish , c ) $ P_k $ in $ ( 9 ) $ is not a probability density function ( PDF ) , simply a sample of the MCMC algorithm , and d ) Section 2.4 is confusing because $ p $ and $ n $ are sometimes interchanged , no contextualizing figure is provided , assumptions are not interpreted , etc . I recommend to reject this paper , but only because I believe it should be rewritten to be exposed clearly . Although the contribution is worthwhile , the paper is confusing and misleading . I am open to changing my recommendation if the authors introduce major changes in the presentation , writing , and structure , while still presenting the same content . Among writing inaccuracies , using the term `` density estimation '' in the title of the paper is among the worse . Any Bayesian approach obtains a posterior distribution ( explicitly or implicitly ) , but this is not the same problem as estimating the probability distribution of some given data . The following questions point to some of the key problems I have found in the paper , without any specific order : * Have the authors evaluated the assumption that the Gaussian model for noise is sufficiently robust for the application even when other noise models are used for the empirical results ? * Could the authors define the times at which the algorithm is run and the times at which data is collected ? as well as the relation between them ? A simple , intuitive , and correct notation for the data is needed . That could be the first step towards obtaining it . * Could the authors clarify in which sense the minimum number of data points is restricted ( not confined ) by the fact that the algorithm is aiming at real-time operation ? * Could the authors clarify the role of $ \\rho $ ? It is mentioned in _Remark 2_ and does not seem to appear again . * Could the authors give some hints to the readers on how the expectation-maximization algorithm is used for delay compensation ? This would greatly aid reproducibility . * Could the authors explain what is , and discuss the results of , AR-MAPS in Table 1 ? * Could the authors use clearer measures of improvement than percentages of improvement ? These are ill-defined and it is hard to pin which percentages are being reported . * Is the resulting posterior as informative when the parameters are zero because the needle is not in contact with the soft surface ? Could the vertical axes in Figure 2 be expanded to explore that ? * Could the authors clarify in which sense their simulated data is realistic ? The appendix is quite uninformative to non-experts in the application . Suggestions to improve the paper - not specifically related to my recommendation : * Thoroughly revise the use of English : some sentences are missing key components . * Emphasize and clarify throughout the paper the role of the _temporal forgetting factor_ , and the fact that it is not simply a user-defined constant , but a function of the observed model mismatch : this can be confusing to those that are not used to the concept . * Use the entire available horizontal space in Figures 2 , 3 and 4 : it will help visualize some of the key features and look better . * Use transparency for the line plots in Figures 3 and 4 : it will allow to see their individual behavior better . * Resize the fonts in all plots to match the size of the Figure captions : this will make them much easier to read . * Correct the references ( capitalization , etc . ) , e.g. , Hunt-Crossley vs hunt-crossley in ( Haddadi , Hashtrudi-Zaad , 2012 ) .", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "- * * Comment : * * 1. a major change in the usual MCMC scheme is ... 2. the number of different notations ... 3 . $ P_k $ in ( 9 ) is not a ... 4 .

Remark 2 is a usual trick to avoid numerical instability . Considering the importance of comparing latest data pack with the previous data pack , we originally presented this in the preliminaries part . In the revision , we moved this content to the algorithm section . 2.Revised.A timeline is also added to make it more clear . 3.Corrected . 4.Corrected . - * * Comment : * * The following questions point to some of the key problems I have found in the paper , without any specific order : ... - * * Authors \u2019 Response : * * We have changed the title to \u201c ARMCMC : Online Model Parameters full probability Estimation in Bayesian Paradigm \u201d . 1.It is true that according to central limit theorem , infinite sum of different noise would be Gaussian ; however , impulse noise is a common source of uncertainty which can not be modeled as a Gaussian . So the answer to this question would be , although there are some practical examples in which Gaussian noise can not model the uncertainty in the system , it is still crucial to have some general approach like ARMCMC for applications like online force prediction for robotics manipulators interacting with an environment . 2.To answer this question , we decided to draw a timeline for the algorithm/data interval in Fig.1 of the revised manuscript . 3.The minimum required evaluation is restricted to guarantee the algorithm achieve the desire precision and reliability . While its maximum is confined to assure the evaluation can be done in the dedicated time slot due to hardware limitation . For the first example , given $ \\lambda = 0.7 , \\epsilon = 0.01 , \\delta = 0.9 $ to compute the minimum and hardware specification to compute maximum , we have $ $ K_ { min } =6000 \\leq K \\leq K_ { max } \\approx 8000 $ $ 4 . $ \\rho $ reflects volatility of the model parameters . For systems with fast-pacing parameters , $ \\rho $ should take larger values . It has also added to the revised paper . 5.Due to the space limitation , we have not implement that . So we decide to put it in future works . 6.This is directly from the paper : \u201c The point estimation obtained by considering the mode at modification phase and medium during reinforcement in ARMCMC is denoted as AR-MAPS. \u201d In other words , when the probability distribution of parameters are not dense enough ( which would happen during modification phase ) , we choose the mode other than medium . While as the parameter probability get less dispersed , we choose the mean of particles as the point estimate . The results in Table 1 shows AR-MAPS shows better performance in point estimates while the underlying method for this and AR-APS are exactly the same . That is the reason authors think this can not necessarily a good measure to evaluate the performance of ARMCMC . The real priority of this method would be fulfilled when it is combined with probabilistic robust approaches , to have a complete decision making on a probabilistic era . 7.MAE and RMS are the most standard ways to report the error . We use percentage to present relative not absolute improvement . 70 % improvement is the minimum improvement among three parameters and 55 % is the improvement in the probability of interest ( here the force ) . 8.Yes , As the system lose its contact with the environment , we put the parameters equal to zero as an informative . However , we do not know when the contact would be lost , this would be calculated by computing the model mismatch index . We did not expand that figure to show the zero , cause it would be less noticeable to distinguish between other variables around the true value . 9.The empirical results is based on a model-based dynamic of a needle in contact to a soft tissue . Based on ( Abolhassani et al. , 2007 ) , this model provide a meticulous model of the contact . We use this to synthetic the data for simulation . However , for the model , we only consider the Hunt-Crossley model and all the other parts considered as unmodeled dynamic and uncertainty . - * * Comment : * * Suggestions to improve the paper - not specifically related to my recommendation : ... - * * Authors \u2019 Response : * * 1 .
