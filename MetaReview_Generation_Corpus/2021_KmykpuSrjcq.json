The main idea is to maintain a list of cluster centers ( i.e. , prototypes ) , and use them to estimate the similarity between a key and query . Because the cluster centers also need to be learned , the proposed method is an iterative , EM-like algorithm where the clusters are produced every now and then . From the arXiv upload time , this is an improved version of the manuscript submitted for NeurIPS 2020 . Back then I was pretty interested in this work and was able to reproduce some of the improvements ( e.g. , some minor improvements on ImageNet linear evaluation ) observed in the paper using my own implementation . So this paper did a pretty good exploration and I would trust the results in the paper . However , the main concern is on significance now , as there are concurrent submissions like BYOL ( which claims to implicitly perform bootstrapping representation learning ) , or more closely SwAV ( an online-clustering algorithm that also aims at unsupervised learning ) . Both BYOL and SwAV are accepted at NeurIPS already with better performance on several evaluation benchmarks ( e.g.semi-supervised setting , BYOL reports 78.4 top-5 accuracy with 1 % labels ) , yet unfortunately this work does not . Nevertheless , I would still give an acceptance rating as : 1 ) This is solid work , I have personally implemented this work and the observation is quite consistent with what 's described in the paper , at least for some major experiments . 2 ) Doing an EM-style clustering with momentum encoder/key is indeed something that has never been explored to my knowledge , and there is some novelty to it . 3 ) It also proposes a prototype-specific T , which is quite new and well-motivated .

In terms of BYOL , since it does not optimize for a clustering objective , we hypothesize that the representations learned by BYOL will be more evenly distributed similar to MoCo . 3.The cluster-varying temperature is crucial for good performance due to its ability to address the imbalance in cluster sizes . Using a global temperature results in more imbalanced clusters ( as shown in Figure 3a ) and a skewed distribution of representations . The final performance also drops by a considerable amount if a global temperature is used .

Contrastive learning is widely used in instance-level SSL . However , considering it can not model the inter-sample structures , the authors proposed a new method called prototypical contrastive learning ( PCL ) , which boosts the original contrastive learning with clustering technique . It can be interpreted as an EM procedure . Though the high-level idea is similar to deep clustering and its variants , the authors argued that PCL can address the issue of reinitialization and potential cluster collapse , as demonstrated in the formulas . In the experiments , the authors performed extensive experiments to demonstrate the efficiency of PCL . [ Strength ] 1 . The authors presented a well-written paper with some theoretical explanations and extensive experiments . It is easy to follow with some good insights in the words . 2.The proposed PCL is formulated as an EM procedure . Though see it as an EM algorithm at a high-level is not novel , this paper has a relatively thorough derivation and give a good intuition behind the proposed PCL method . 3.The authors demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed PCL on various datasets and settings . Compared with MoCo , its main counterpart , PCL achieve substantial improvement over it across the board . [ Concerns ] 1 . Introducing a EM-like procedure to mitigate the reinitialization issue has been proposed in previous works . Though not on large-scale dataset , JULE ( Yang et al 2016 ) proposed to use a forward and backward pass for alternative learning , which corresponds to the E-step and M-step in this paper , respectively . To date , there are also some papers that proposed a similar strategy to address the issue of oscillation , such as `` Online Deep Clustering for Unsupervised Representation Learning . 2020 '' .2.The proposed PCL combined momentum contrast and deep cluster technique , as formulated in Eq . ( 11 ) .This formula prompts the interaction of intra-instance learning and inter-instance learning . From the experiments , it is not clear how they cooperate with each other during the training . Does the PCL ( 2nd term in Eq . ( 11 ) ) solely perform poorly in representation learning ? [ Summary ] Overall , I think this paper presents a clean formula to reconcile the intra-instance and inter-instance unsupervised learning methods , which seems to be a promising direction for further exploration . Based on my above comments , I think this is a good paper , and recommend acceptance . I would suggest the authors can address my above concerns and provide more insights about how these two losses interact with each other during the learning process in the rebuttal .", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "reply_text": "We thank the reviewer for the insightful and positive comments . Here are our responses . We agree with the reviewer that joint clustering and representation learning has been proposed in the previous methods . Here we want to emphasize that the contribution of PCL is to bridge clustering with contrastive learning , and explicitly formulate the EM procedures . We appreciate the relevant online clustering paper and have discussed it in related works . We observe that both terms in Eq . ( 11 ) are important to the performance . The inter-instance learning ( first term ) is more important at the beginning of training , while the intra-instance learning ( second term ) becomes more important as training progresses and the clusters become more meaningful . In Table 7 ( appendix A ) , we report the experimental results with only the first or the second term . We observe that using only the second term achieves decent results , given that the first term is used for warm-up . We hypothesize that a better training curriculum could further improve the performance of PCL , but leave it for future work ."}], "0": {"review_id": "KmykpuSrjcq-0", "review_text": "# # # Summary In this paper , the authors propose a method for contrastive learning inspired on current instance discrimination approaches .

BYOL has also been added ."}, "3": {"review_id": "KmykpuSrjcq-3", "review_text": "[ Overview ] In this paper , the authors tackle the problem of unsupervised visual representation learning by combining the deep clustering technique and momentum contrastive learning . Contrastive learning is widely used in instance-level SSL . However , considering it can not model the inter-sample structures , the authors proposed a new method called prototypical contrastive learning ( PCL ) , which boosts the original contrastive learning with clustering technique . It can be interpreted as an EM procedure . Though the high-level idea is similar to deep clustering and its variants , the authors argued that PCL can address the issue of reinitialization and potential cluster collapse , as demonstrated in the formulas . In the experiments , the authors performed extensive experiments to demonstrate the efficiency of PCL . [ Strength ] 1 . The authors presented a well-written paper with some theoretical explanations and extensive experiments . It is easy to follow with some good insights in the words . 2.The proposed PCL is formulated as an EM procedure . Though see it as an EM algorithm at a high-level is not novel , this paper has a relatively thorough derivation and give a good intuition behind the proposed PCL method . 3.The authors demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed PCL on various datasets and settings . Compared with MoCo , its main counterpart , PCL achieve substantial improvement over it across the board . [ Concerns ] 1 . Introducing a EM-like procedure to mitigate the reinitialization issue has been proposed in previous works . Though not on large-scale dataset , JULE ( Yang et al 2016 ) proposed to use a forward and backward pass for alternative learning , which corresponds to the E-step and M-step in this paper , respectively . To date , there are also some papers that proposed a similar strategy to address the issue of oscillation , such as `` Online Deep Clustering for Unsupervised Representation Learning . 2020 '' .2.The proposed PCL combined momentum contrast and deep cluster technique , as formulated in Eq . ( 11 ) .This formula prompts the interaction of intra-instance learning and inter-instance learning . From the experiments , it is not clear how they cooperate with each other during the training . Does the PCL ( 2nd term in Eq . ( 11 ) ) solely perform poorly in representation learning ? [ Summary ] Overall , I think this paper presents a clean formula to reconcile the intra-instance and inter-instance unsupervised learning methods , which seems to be a promising direction for further exploration . Based on my above comments , I think this is a good paper , and recommend acceptance . I would suggest the authors can address my above concerns and provide more insights about how these two losses interact with each other during the learning process in the rebuttal .", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "reply_text": "We thank the reviewer for the insightful and positive comments . Here are our responses . We agree with the reviewer that joint clustering and representation learning has been proposed in the previous methods . Here we want to emphasize that the contribution of PCL is to bridge clustering with contrastive learning , and explicitly formulate the EM procedures . We appreciate the relevant online clustering paper and have discussed it in related works . We observe that both terms in Eq . ( 11 ) are important to the performance . The inter-instance learning ( first term ) is more important at the beginning of training , while the intra-instance learning ( second term ) becomes more important as training progresses and the clusters become more meaningful . In Table 7 ( appendix A ) , we report the experimental results with only the first or the second term . We observe that using only the second term achieves decent results , given that the first term is used for warm-up . We hypothesize that a better training curriculum could further improve the performance of PCL , but leave it for future work ."}}
