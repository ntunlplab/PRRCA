This departs from the standard transformer architecture where the decoder uses only the final encoder layer. This paper investigates how encoder layer fusion works, where the decoder layers have access to information for various encoder layers. The main finding of the paper is that the encoder embedding layer is particularly important. They propose SurfaceFusion, which only connects the encoder embedding layer to the softmax layer of decoders, leading to accuracy gains.\n\nThere was some disagreement among reviewers about this paper. Overall, I found this a simple but effective contribution with interesting findings that can help future research in seq2seq models. Some of the weaknesses (discussing other relevant works, discussing other variants of FGLA, adding new experimental results) have been addressed in the updated version of the paper. One of the reviewers suggested running additional experiments on GLUE-style tasks (with a masked language model) to be really sure if the technique is convincing, and particularly try it with larger models (T5 was suggested). While adding those experiments would be a plus, I disagree that this is crucial - this paper is focusing on seq2seq tasks and is already considering several tasks: summarization, MT, and grammar correction. The results found by this paper are interesting and can foster future research extending this beyond these 3 tasks. Even if larger models can make the improvements smaller, there are many inconveniences in just increasing scale (memory consumption, energy consumption, etc.) It is my opinion that the community should value research that tries to understand the weaknesses of smaller models, rather than relying on large scale models to solve all problems.", "reviews": [{"review_id": "n1HD8M6WGn-0", "review_text": "# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Summary # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # This paper introduces the fine-grained layer attention to evaluate the contribution of individual encoder layers and investigate how encoder layer fusion works , where the decoder layers have access to information for various encoder layers as opposed to only the final encoder layer as in standard Transformer .

( 2018 ) to train the models with the huge mini-batches of nearly 460K tokens , significantly improving the model performances . To clear up the misunderstanding of the existing score of En-De , we replace it with the result of the big-batch training ( Ott et al. , 2018 ) in Table 2 ; 2 ) For the summarization task , we follow Paulus et al .

Larger models are not always the better models -- a suitable model size related to data scale is a better choice for Seq2Seq tasks . In our preliminary experiments , we tested several model variants for each Seq2Seq task and used its best-performing setting as the baseline : 1 ) Base Transformer ( 6 enc/dec layers and 512 hidden size ) for the Ro-En , summarization , and correction tasks ; and 2 ) Big Transformer ( 6 enc/dec layers and 1024 hidden size ) for the En-De and En-Fr translation tasks . We reimplemented the Big T5 model ( 12 enc/dec layers and 1024 hidden size ) , which failed to outperform our Transformer-Big baseline ( 28.2 vs. 28.9 ) when learning from scratch on the En-De dataset . The reproduced result ( i.e.28.2 ) is consistent with the results reported in their paper ( i.e.28.1/41.0 on the En-De and En-Fr datasets ) , which underperform our baselines ( 28.9/43.4 ) . Our proposed SurfaceFusion method can consistently improve the model performance across model variants with different sizes , demonstrating the effectiveness and universality of our approach .

If the encoder source embeddings are very important , and layerwise/finegrained attention perform similarly well , why not simplify the approach and simply add/concat them to the output of the encoder ( or somewhere else where it makes sense ) ? have you tried this instead of introducing additional hyperparams ? * In our preliminary experiments , we have tried simply adding or concatenating encoder embedding to the encoder output , which fail to outperform the baseline model ( 28.2 / 27.9 vs. 28.9 ) . By observing the learning curves , we found that these techniques brought a faster convergence at the beginning of training , but fell into a sub-optimal local optimum soon . One possible reason is that the model is biased in learning easy-to-learn surface features from the embedding layer and thus quickly overfits . Conversely , the proposed \u201c SurfaceFusion \u201d performs fusion at probability-level to strike the right balance between the learning of both surface and abstract features , which lead to better local optimum and model performance . 2. > * What are the costs in terms of wall-clock time when introducing an additional softmax operation for every token in the decoder ? * The additional softmax brings a 10 % speed slower than vanilla model ( from 0.018s per token to 0.020s per token ) . This is included in the revised paper ."}, "2": {"review_id": "n1HD8M6WGn-2", "review_text": "The authors perform a thorough analysis of encoder fusion for Transformers : which encoder layer should the N-th decoder layer attend to ?

To strengthen our Seq2Seq baselines on top of the existing models , we employed several simple yet effective techniques : 1 ) For the En-De and En-Fr translation tasks , we follow Ott et al . ( 2018 ) to train the models with the huge mini-batches of nearly 460K tokens , significantly improving the model performances . To clear up the misunderstanding of the existing score of En-De , we replace it with the result of the big-batch training ( Ott et al. , 2018 ) in Table 2 ; 2 ) For the summarization task , we follow Paulus et al . ( 2018 ) to disallow repeating the same trigram ; 3 ) For the correction task , we apply a very strong regularization technique SwitchOut ( Wang et al. , 2018 ) to learn a better model . As far as we know , this is the first time to apply this technique to a correction task ; 4 ) In particular , our Ro-En and En-Fr results are very competitive even with such a pure model architecture .

Larger models are not always the better models -- a suitable model size related to data scale is a better choice for Seq2Seq tasks . In our preliminary experiments , we tested several model variants for each Seq2Seq task and used its best-performing setting as the baseline : 1 ) Base Transformer ( 6 enc/dec layers and 512 hidden size ) for the Ro-En , summarization , and correction tasks ; and 2 ) Big Transformer ( 6 enc/dec layers and 1024 hidden size ) for the En-De and En-Fr translation tasks . We reimplemented the Big T5 model ( 12 enc/dec layers and 1024 hidden size ) , which failed to outperform our Transformer-Big baseline ( 28.2 vs. 28.9 ) when learning from scratch on the En-De dataset . The reproduced result ( i.e.28.2 ) is consistent with the results reported in their paper ( i.e.28.1/41.0 on the En-De and En-Fr datasets ) , which underperform our baselines ( 28.9/43.4 ) . Our proposed SurfaceFusion method can consistently improve the model performance across model variants with different sizes , demonstrating the effectiveness and universality of our approach .

A previous work of ( [ Nguyen and Chiang , 2018 ] ( https : //www.aclweb.org/anthology/N18-1031/ ) ) proposed a similar way of fusing source embeddings directly to the output of the decoder . Their work can be seen as Surface fusion proposed in this paper .

We believe that the bottleneck hypothesis of source representation still holds true for standard seq2seq.The difference between FGLA and the vanilla Transformer is the connections between encoder and decoder layers . If the source representation does not exist , FGLA would fail to improve the model performance , which turned out to be false in Tables 1 & 2 in the revised submission . These results reconfirm our hypothesis . Along this direction , we propose a novel SurfaceFusion for a better information flow for Seq2seq , which further improves the model performance . 2. > * Compared to the previous fusion method that uses a scalar per layer as attention weight ( i.e. , Transparent Attention ) in the work of Bapna et . al. , 2018 , FGLA generalizes it by making a vector per layer .

First , FGLA achieves better performance in our preliminary experiments ( Table 1 in the revised submission ) . This is consistent with previous studies ( Tu et al.2017 ; Choi et al.2018 ) , which show that a weight vector outperforms its scalar counterpart . Second , the vector weight of FGLA enables the singular value analysis ( Figures 3 & 4 ) to evaluate the expressivity of attended dimensions in the encoder embedding layer , which shows that the proposed SurfaceFusion method improves model performance by extracting useful surface features as expected . The singular value analysis can not be done by the scalar weight of Transparent Attention method . Zhaopeng Tu , Yang Liu , Zhengdong Lu , Xiaohua Liu , and Hang Li .
