I believe that , given the related work reviewers have mentioned , the paper most likely requires some experimental comparisons with these other methods . The rebuttal arguments are good , but not convincing enough that I can believe in this method 's superiority without seeing a comparison with , e.g. , CaCE . Objective : Explain the output of high-dimensional ML models in a human-interpretable way by using Shapley values on semantically meaningful latent features . Strengths : * This is an extremely important problem ; the shortcomings of e.g.pixel-based methods for images are important and well-noted . * The proposed method is a promising way to attribute to ( and in some cases , learn ) semantically meaningful latent features . * dSprites serves as a good ground truth where the generative process is known , and serves to validate some of the human-interpretable patterns found . Weaknesses : My overall concern is that while the experimental results are interesting , they are not thorough and do n't demonstrate the marginal value of this method relative to other possible methods in the space ; for example , concept bottleneck or causal concept effect models . * I did n't see a reference to Koh et al 's `` Concept Bottleneck Models '' ( https : //arxiv.org/abs/2007.04612 ) , which do supervised learning of semantic concepts then train a classifier on top of those concepts , which is very similar/relevant work . * Similarly I did n't see a reference to Goyal et al 's `` Explaining Classifiers with Causal Concept Effect ( CaCE ) '' , which trains a VAE to learn a meaningful latent space and report causal effects of modifications to the latent variables . The existence of this prior work sharpens some specific questions I had when reading the paper : * For the non-Fourier tasks , why use a VAE latent space ? It 's impossible to know that VAE latent dimensions ( when they do look like they correspond to a concept ) correspond * only * to that concept . The bar charts stating `` most importance goes to vertical position/digit identity '' seem overconfident , since that is only our guess of what the latent dimension means . In contrast , a concept bottleneck model has dimensions with clear meaning ( they were trained with supervision ) . This is acknowledged to some degree in the text . * Also , for the non-Fourier tasks , why use the Shapley framework ? CaCE is a very similar approach , using a VAE to get explanations in terms of an interpretable latent space , but does n't use Shapley . What are the pros and cons of each approach ? Also , given a meaningful latent space , why not use gradient-based methods ( i.e. , integrated gradients ) to attribute to it ? Overall , I do n't think this method needs to blow the others out of the water ; there are legitimate counterpoints to be made -- for example , concept bottleneck models require concept labels , though I believe such labels are available in the CelebA experiments . But a thoughtful discussion of the relationship of this work to methods like concept bottlenecks or CaCE is essential -- and not present in the current version . Other weaknesses : * The quality of the resulting explanations is not assessed rigorously . The fact that the dSprites example picks up on vertical position and the MNIST example picks up on digit value is useful , but many interpretability papers look more exhaustively , across the dataset , at what happens to the model output when the features reported as important are at least perturbed or ablated , or if a model is retrained with the features altered . I would particularly like to see such a comparison with concept bottleneck and/or CaCE : if this method ( Shapley with VAE ) is the right way to do things , perhaps it will outperform the other methods at predicting how much certain concept shifts will affect model output or model retraining . * The Fourier examples are interesting but feel a bit like toy examples to me because they are a specific case with a convenient invertible feature map and mostly recapitulate known properties of adversarial examples ( they rely on high-frequency patterns ) . * Minor comment : The `` landscape of semantic representations '' could be shortened , potentially leaving room for more comparisons to other methods/benchmarks of the attributions .", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "reply_text": "We thank the reviewer for his thoughtful review * '' I did n't see a reference to Koh et al 's `` Concept Bottleneck Models '' ( https : //arxiv.org/abs/2007.04612 ) , which do supervised learning of semantic concepts then train a classifier on top of those concepts , which is very similar/relevant work .

As such they are not applicable in many situations where one would want a model explanation . For example , when auditing an existing deployed model . It is also worth pointing out that such a comparison is somewhat unfair since Concept-Bottleneck Models require supervised labels , while the MNIST experiment was done fully unsupervised . Given access to appropriate labels , our method could be applied on a latent with labels disentangled supervisedly - as is done in the CelebA experiment . * '' Also , for the non-Fourier tasks , why use the Shapley framework ?

However , the methods diverge in how the remaining features are treated . In CaCE remaining features are kept at their current values . This leads to correlation amongst features not being accounted for when generating explanations . To give a concrete example , if a task consisted in classifying images into two classes , where one class contains images of red squares , green squares and red triangles and another class contains images of green triangles . Applying CaCE to explain predictions of a perfect classifier on an image of a red square would incorrectly yield an explanation in which neither colour nor shape were judged important . This is because changing either one of these features would not change the model output . Shapley values expressly consider all combinations of features to account for such cross-feature effects . Such types of behaviors are highlighted in our DSprites experiment where feature correlation is important for the model outputs ."}, {"review_id": "VlRqY4sV9FO-2", "review_text": "Summary : This paper develops a Shapley value approach to explanation that uses low-dimensional latent features to explain the original input . In high-dimensional settings , Shapley values can be computationally intractable ; as such , the authors adapt the characteristic ( aka value ) function $ v ( \\cdot ) $ to consider coalitions defined in latent space . This helps ensure that only feasible and plausible ( i.e. , semantically meaningful ) perturbations are made . They consider three different latent encodings : Fourier Transforms , Disentanglement , and image-to-image translation ( to isolate factors of variation ) . Strengths - The paper tackles a difficult problem in practice : applying Shapley explanations to high dimensional data . The authors do a fine job of motivating this problem and their subsequent solution . - The paper is quite thorough in its experimentation as it experiments with CIFAR-10 , Describable Textures , dSprites , CelebA , and MNIST . Weaknesses - I would have strongly preferred to see a computational analysis of how much more tractable moving to latent space makes the Shapley value .

If you just train an end-to-end model , f , on ( x , y ) pairs , how can we be sure that the generative , latent factors captured by z are actually used by f ? `` * Reply : The discriminative model operates on x . As we perform blackbox model-agnostic explainability , we are not concerned with whether the discriminative model _actually uses_ the latent variables z . Instead , our method provides a way to describe the model 's observed behaviour ( which undoubtedly relies on very complex internal dynamics ) to human users in terms of these more intuitive latent variables . * '' Can you comment on the relationship between the Shapley values directly on the input data versus the Shapley values on the latent factors , if any ? `` * Reply : Applying the Shapley values directly on data would generate an explanation in which each pixel was attributed a score quantifying its importance to the model prediction . Applying the Shapley values on latent factors attributes a score to each latent features importance . Because each latent feature is designed to encode a semantic concept such scores can then be attributed to the associated semantic concept ."}, {"review_id": "VlRqY4sV9FO-3", "review_text": "The paper describes a technique for interpreting the results of a neural net in human-readable terms . The basic idea is natural and simple : ( 1 ) find a small number of coordinates for the feature space that correspond to human-interpretable concepts ; ( 2 ) use Shapley values to assign credit to these coordinates . Strong points : While there is work related to this idea ( which the authors cite appropriately ) , the overall technique is new . The authors do a good job of backing up the theoretical idea with a set of experiments that seem to produce useful results . ( The adversarial example scenario and the celebrity data set use case were especially easy to understand . ) The exposition is also very clear . Weak points : Shapley values are not the only way to exploit human-interpretable coordinates ( although they especially are made feasible by the reduction in number of features ) . The paper might be even stronger if it compared other methods . However , I would n't reject the paper on this basis . I recommend acceptance . This is a solid paper and is likely to be well-cited . Additional feedback / suggestions for improvement : * I found the math notation a little confusing . There are three general types of objects : ( a ) the different spaces where representations live ( feature space vs. the interpretable space ) , ( b ) elements of those spaces , and ( c ) functions between those spaces . Certain symbols seemed to do double duty , for instance $ \\tilde { x } $ seemed to float between these meanings . I 'd recommend clear distinctions and contrasting notation for each type of object . * The authors talk about an `` approximate inverse '' $ \\tilde { x } $ . It 's not really an inverse , maybe more like a pseudoinverse ( or maybe a left or right inverse , depending on notation ) . Perhaps consider alternate terminology . * When $ \\tilde { x } $ is differentiable , one could immediately apply other interpretability techniques besides Shapley values ( for instance , take a gradient of the class score with respect to the interpretable coordinate space ) . Ideally , it would be nice to see how these look , so we could compare how much of the clarity of results is due to good coordinates , and how much to use of Shapley values . This would be particularly straightforward in the first Fourier transform example .", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "reply_text": "We thank the reviewer for taking the time to review the paper and for the constructive comments which will help further improve the paper .

Strengths : * This is an extremely important problem ; the shortcomings of e.g.pixel-based methods for images are important and well-noted . * The proposed method is a promising way to attribute to ( and in some cases , learn ) semantically meaningful latent features . * dSprites serves as a good ground truth where the generative process is known , and serves to validate some of the human-interpretable patterns found . Weaknesses : My overall concern is that while the experimental results are interesting , they are not thorough and do n't demonstrate the marginal value of this method relative to other possible methods in the space ; for example , concept bottleneck or causal concept effect models . * I did n't see a reference to Koh et al 's `` Concept Bottleneck Models '' ( https : //arxiv.org/abs/2007.04612 ) , which do supervised learning of semantic concepts then train a classifier on top of those concepts , which is very similar/relevant work . * Similarly I did n't see a reference to Goyal et al 's `` Explaining Classifiers with Causal Concept Effect ( CaCE ) '' , which trains a VAE to learn a meaningful latent space and report causal effects of modifications to the latent variables . The existence of this prior work sharpens some specific questions I had when reading the paper : * For the non-Fourier tasks , why use a VAE latent space ? It 's impossible to know that VAE latent dimensions ( when they do look like they correspond to a concept ) correspond * only * to that concept . The bar charts stating `` most importance goes to vertical position/digit identity '' seem overconfident , since that is only our guess of what the latent dimension means . In contrast , a concept bottleneck model has dimensions with clear meaning ( they were trained with supervision ) . This is acknowledged to some degree in the text . * Also , for the non-Fourier tasks , why use the Shapley framework ? CaCE is a very similar approach , using a VAE to get explanations in terms of an interpretable latent space , but does n't use Shapley . What are the pros and cons of each approach ? Also , given a meaningful latent space , why not use gradient-based methods ( i.e. , integrated gradients ) to attribute to it ? Overall , I do n't think this method needs to blow the others out of the water ; there are legitimate counterpoints to be made -- for example , concept bottleneck models require concept labels , though I believe such labels are available in the CelebA experiments . But a thoughtful discussion of the relationship of this work to methods like concept bottlenecks or CaCE is essential -- and not present in the current version . Other weaknesses : * The quality of the resulting explanations is not assessed rigorously . The fact that the dSprites example picks up on vertical position and the MNIST example picks up on digit value is useful , but many interpretability papers look more exhaustively , across the dataset , at what happens to the model output when the features reported as important are at least perturbed or ablated , or if a model is retrained with the features altered . I would particularly like to see such a comparison with concept bottleneck and/or CaCE : if this method ( Shapley with VAE ) is the right way to do things , perhaps it will outperform the other methods at predicting how much certain concept shifts will affect model output or model retraining . * The Fourier examples are interesting but feel a bit like toy examples to me because they are a specific case with a convenient invertible feature map and mostly recapitulate known properties of adversarial examples ( they rely on high-frequency patterns ) . * Minor comment : The `` landscape of semantic representations '' could be shortened , potentially leaving room for more comparisons to other methods/benchmarks of the attributions .", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "reply_text": "We thank the reviewer for his thoughtful review * '' I did n't see a reference to Koh et al 's `` Concept Bottleneck Models '' ( https : //arxiv.org/abs/2007.04612 ) , which do supervised learning of semantic concepts then train a classifier on top of those concepts , which is very similar/relevant work .

It is also worth pointing out that such a comparison is somewhat unfair since Concept-Bottleneck Models require supervised labels , while the MNIST experiment was done fully unsupervised .

However , the methods diverge in how the remaining features are treated . In CaCE remaining features are kept at their current values . This leads to correlation amongst features not being accounted for when generating explanations . To give a concrete example , if a task consisted in classifying images into two classes , where one class contains images of red squares , green squares and red triangles and another class contains images of green triangles . Applying CaCE to explain predictions of a perfect classifier on an image of a red square would incorrectly yield an explanation in which neither colour nor shape were judged important . This is because changing either one of these features would not change the model output . Shapley values expressly consider all combinations of features to account for such cross-feature effects . Such types of behaviors are highlighted in our DSprites experiment where feature correlation is important for the model outputs ."}, "2": {"review_id": "VlRqY4sV9FO-2", "review_text": "Summary : This paper develops a Shapley value approach to explanation that uses low-dimensional latent features to explain the original input . In high-dimensional settings , Shapley values can be computationally intractable ; as such , the authors adapt the characteristic ( aka value ) function $ v ( \\cdot ) $ to consider coalitions defined in latent space . This helps ensure that only feasible and plausible ( i.e. , semantically meaningful ) perturbations are made . They consider three different latent encodings : Fourier Transforms , Disentanglement , and image-to-image translation ( to isolate factors of variation ) . Strengths - The paper tackles a difficult problem in practice : applying Shapley explanations to high dimensional data . The authors do a fine job of motivating this problem and their subsequent solution . - The paper is quite thorough in its experimentation as it experiments with CIFAR-10 , Describable Textures , dSprites , CelebA , and MNIST . Weaknesses - I would have strongly preferred to see a computational analysis of how much more tractable moving to latent space makes the Shapley value . It may be an exponential time reduction if z is chosen to be log ( d ) for example . -- Is there a sensible algorithm ( or heuristic ) for selecting the number of latent factors when encoding ? Perhaps there is a tradeoff between the size of z and the explanation quality ...

If you just train an end-to-end model , f , on ( x , y ) pairs , how can we be sure that the generative , latent factors captured by z are actually used by f ? - Can you comment on the relationship between the Shapley values directly on the input data versus the Shapley values on the latent factors , if any ?", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "We thank the reviewer for his review and are glad that he found our approach interesting . * '' I would have strongly preferred to see a computational analysis of how much more tractable moving to latent space makes the Shapley value .

As we perform blackbox model-agnostic explainability , we are not concerned with whether the discriminative model _actually uses_ the latent variables z . Instead , our method provides a way to describe the model 's observed behaviour ( which undoubtedly relies on very complex internal dynamics ) to human users in terms of these more intuitive latent variables . * '' Can you comment on the relationship between the Shapley values directly on the input data versus the Shapley values on the latent factors , if any ? `` * Reply : Applying the Shapley values directly on data would generate an explanation in which each pixel was attributed a score quantifying its importance to the model prediction . Applying the Shapley values on latent factors attributes a score to each latent features importance . Because each latent feature is designed to encode a semantic concept such scores can then be attributed to the associated semantic concept ."}, "3": {"review_id": "VlRqY4sV9FO-3", "review_text": "The paper describes a technique for interpreting the results of a neural net in human-readable terms . The basic idea is natural and simple : ( 1 ) find a small number of coordinates for the feature space that correspond to human-interpretable concepts ; ( 2 ) use Shapley values to assign credit to these coordinates . Strong points : While there is work related to this idea ( which the authors cite appropriately ) , the overall technique is new . The authors do a good job of backing up the theoretical idea with a set of experiments that seem to produce useful results . ( The adversarial example scenario and the celebrity data set use case were especially easy to understand . ) The exposition is also very clear . Weak points : Shapley values are not the only way to exploit human-interpretable coordinates ( although they especially are made feasible by the reduction in number of features ) . The paper might be even stronger if it compared other methods . However , I would n't reject the paper on this basis . I recommend acceptance . This is a solid paper and is likely to be well-cited . Additional feedback / suggestions for improvement : * I found the math notation a little confusing . There are three general types of objects : ( a ) the different spaces where representations live ( feature space vs. the interpretable space ) , ( b ) elements of those spaces , and ( c ) functions between those spaces . Certain symbols seemed to do double duty , for instance $ \\tilde { x } $ seemed to float between these meanings . I 'd recommend clear distinctions and contrasting notation for each type of object . * The authors talk about an `` approximate inverse '' $ \\tilde { x } $ . It 's not really an inverse , maybe more like a pseudoinverse ( or maybe a left or right inverse , depending on notation ) . Perhaps consider alternate terminology . * When $ \\tilde { x } $ is differentiable , one could immediately apply other interpretability techniques besides Shapley values ( for instance , take a gradient of the class score with respect to the interpretable coordinate space ) . Ideally , it would be nice to see how these look , so we could compare how much of the clarity of results is due to good coordinates , and how much to use of Shapley values . This would be particularly straightforward in the first Fourier transform example .", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "reply_text": "We thank the reviewer for taking the time to review the paper and for the constructive comments which will help further improve the paper .

However , we feel that Shapley values are particularly well suited here . To recapitulate why . Traditionally Shapley values suffer from two weaknesses . 1 ) The amount of samples required for generating an explanation scales aggressively with dimensionality . 2 ) When features are correlated , perturbing features , as done in the shapley calculation , breaks correlations in the dataset and yields non-realistic perturbed data . Shapley values are thus particularly well suited for applications on disentangled models as these issues are severely reduced since the number of features is drastically reduced and features are by design uncorrelated ."}}
