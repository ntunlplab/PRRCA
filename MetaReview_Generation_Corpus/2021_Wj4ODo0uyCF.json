I appreciate that the authors do not read too much into it and focus more on the analysis of the results , but one thing that remains unanswered in this paper is how the proposed method fairs against multilingual baselines that utilize ( roughly ) the same number of parameters ; currently , the best models outperform the LS baseline by ~28M and ~10M parameters on OPUS-100 and WMT-14 respectively . How important is this difference ?

Please notice that , apart from LS $ ^\\diamond $ , we also offer CLSR-L for a more fair comparison . CLSR-L extends LS $ ^\\diamond $ by applying the language-specific projection to each sub-layer of the Transformer . It utilizes roughly the same amount of parameters as CLSR * does . Our results show that CLSR-L yields inferior translation performance in almost all settings compared to CLSR * . ( 3 ) Making the hyperparameter p language-specific seems an interesting direction , although we don \u2019 t have much prior knowledge on how to adequately distinguish it among different language pairs . It might be possible that using a smaller p_l for low-resource languages could improve knowledge transfer towards Low languages for M2O translation . But based on our experiments , we would argue that the conclusion about linguistic correlation has a large chance to hold even if we adopt p_l rather than p.

Our experiments show that LS capacity doesn \u2019 t work well in some M2O low-resource settings . Since different language pairs share the same target language in the M2O setting , we argue that sharing parameters could largely encourage positive knowledge transfer and deliver better translation quality towards low-resource languages whose training data might be too scarce to well-train their LS components . 1 ) Regarding M2O Low results in Table 1 Following your suggestion , we inspect the individual BLEU scores for M2O Low test languages .

But we also notice that the win ratio on Low is small ( < 23.81 % ) , revealing the importance of sharing parameters for M2O Low . 2 ) Regarding M2O WR results in Table 2 Compared to OPUS-100 , changes in BLEU tend to be more similar across languages on WMT-14 , meaning that the same average improvement has a higher effect on the WR . Even in absolute terms , there is a clear gap between Top-Bottom and Dedicated/CLSR * . We argue that this is caused by the suboptimal schedule of LS capacity in Top-Bottom , which is partially supported by the evidence in Figure 10 ( c , d ) and Table 5 ( Appendix C ) .

Since different language pairs share the same target language in the M2O setting , we argue that sharing parameters could largely encourage positive knowledge transfer and deliver better translation quality towards low-resource languages whose training data might be too scarce to well-train their LS components . 1 ) Regarding M2O Low results in Table 1 Following your suggestion , we inspect the individual BLEU scores for M2O Low test languages . Below shows the result on the oversampled OPUS-100 , where we list the results for the 8 languages to save space and report relative improvements against the baseline . | | li | my | ig | gd | yi | kn | or | tk | WR on Low | |-|||-|-||||| -- | | LS $ ^\\diamond $ | -6.2 | -4 . | -8.| -15.6 | -9.4 | -5.3 | -2.3 | -4.5 | 4.76 | | CLSR-L | 0.7 | -4 . | -10.6 | -22.8 | -3.1 | -2.7 | -2.7 | -9 . | 14.29 | | Top-Bottom | -1.1 | -1.3 | -2.2 | 2.4 | -7.7 | -4.7 | -0.7 | -2.1 | 14.29 | | Dedicated | -0.5 | -0.1 | -4.4 | 2.8 | -0.1 | -1.4 | -0.6 | -3.5 | 23.81 | | CLSR * | 4.9 | -1.7 | -1.6 | 2.2 | 1.2 | -2.3 | -0.9 | -0.8 | 23.81 | In line with your hypothesis , we observe that LS models suffer from large performance drop on some languages like gd , ig and tk , particularly with LS $ ^\\diamond $ and CLSR-L . But we also notice that the win ratio on Low is small ( < 23.81 % ) , revealing the importance of sharing parameters for M2O Low . 2 ) Regarding M2O WR results in Table 2 Compared to OPUS-100 , changes in BLEU tend to be more similar across languages on WMT-14 , meaning that the same average improvement has a higher effect on the WR . Even in absolute terms , there is a clear gap between Top-Bottom and Dedicated/CLSR * . We argue that this is caused by the suboptimal schedule of LS capacity in Top-Bottom , which is partially supported by the evidence in Figure 10 ( c , d ) and Table 5 ( Appendix C ) . This is consistent with our finding that both the amount and the position of LS capacity matters for multilingual translation ."}}
