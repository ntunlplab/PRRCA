They also note the limitation of neural networks, which require huge amounts of data to properly learn the data structure. The authors therefore propose to first sub-sample the data and afterwards to learn an MDS-like cost function directly with a neural network, resulting in a parametric framework. The paper should be checked for grammatical errors, such as e.g. consistent use of (no) hyphen in low-dimensional (or low dimensional). The abbreviations should be written out on the first use, e.g. MLP, MDS, LLE, etc. In the introduction the authors claim that the complexity of parametric techniques does not depend on the number of data points, or that moving to parametric techniques would reduce memory and computational complexities. This is in general not true. Even if the number of parameters is small, learning them might require complex computations on the whole data set. On the other hand, even if the number of parameters is equal to the number of data points, the computations could be trivial, thus resulting in a complexity of O(N). In section 2.1, the authors claim \"Spectral techniques are non-parametric in nature\"; this is wrong again. E.g. PCA can be formulated as MDS (thus spectral), but can be seen as a parametric mapping which can be used to project new words. In section 2.2, it says \"observation that the double centering...\".

We employ the global stress of Equation 2 as our error function ( since a non-zero stress corresponds to a suboptimal solution as far as distance preserving algorithms are concerned ) . A specific network ( with a given number of hidden layers and nodes per layer ) corresponds to a numerical scheme and hence determines a unique error profile ( like Fig 4a ) and hence can be graded with the order of accuracy it demonstrates in unfurling a manifold like the S-Curve .

The proposed method is (more or less) a modification of the DrLIM manifold learning algorithm (Hadsell, Chopra, LeCun 2006) with a slightly different loss function that is inspired by multidimensional scaling. While DrLIM only preserves local geometry, the modified loss function presents the opportunity to preserve both local and global geometry. The rest of the paper is devoted to an empirical validation of the proposed method on small-scale synthetic data (the familiar Swiss roll, as well as a couple of synthetic image datasets). The paper revisits mostly familiar ideas. The importance of preserving both local and global information in manifold learning is well known, so unclear what the main conceptual novelty is. This reviewer does not believe that modifying the loss function of a well established previous method that is over 10 years old (DrLIM) constitutes a significant enough contribution. Moreover, in this reviewer's experience, the major challenge is to obtain proper estimates of the geodesic distances between far-away points on the manifold, and such an estimation is simply too difficult for any reasonable dataset encountered in practice. However, the authors do not address this, and instead simply use the Isomap approach for approximating geodesics by graph distances, which opens up a completely different set of challenges (how to construct the graph, how to deal with \"holes\" in the manifold, how to avoid short circuiting in the all-pairs shortest path computations etc etc). Finally, the experimental results are somewhat uninspiring.
