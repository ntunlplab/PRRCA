Here are our responses to the concerns : Q1 : [ The unclear relationship with GCN attacks ] Given that the proposed algorithms do not leverage the underlying model structure very much , why the proposed algorithms are special to the graphical neural network is not very clear . It will be great if the authors clearly describe what the proposed methods aim to defend . A1 : Thanks for the interesting question . The goal of our proposed methods is : given that graph neural networks are currently widely applied and recently two state-of-the-art attacks have been proposed against the models such as GCN , we aim to explore the possibilities of detecting such adversarial behaviors ( added/deleted edges ) in various scenarios . So here we aim to focus on these new types of attacks against graph neural network and it is a good idea for us to evaluate our detection method for other attacks in our future work . In addition , the graph models exploit local patterns in a large graph to give reasonable predictions . In order to attack a graph neural network , a malicious attacker can add edge to a node so that the local property of a particular node can be mixed with wrong information , thus leading to confusion . Therefore , our detection method actually leverages such property of GCN by sampling small subgraphs and train the detector which aims to avoid the adversarial impact of local malicious edges . We also exhibit a new experiment in the paper which adds random edges to the graph and use our methods to detect these edges . The result is not as good as the detection of malicious edges . This shows that our methods do capture the sophisticated adversarial behaviors targeting on graph models . Q2 : [ Limitation on the generalization of algorithms ] It seems that victim nodes are carefully selected and fixed throughout all the experiments , but it limits the generalization about the performance of the proposed algorithms . More extensive evaluations are required along with the guideline of what detection algorithm we have to choose for the unsupervised setting . A2 : We would like to emphasize that we did not cherry-pick the victim nodes . We are randomly picking the victim nodes according to its node degrees since we want to check how our approaches perform over nodes with various ( large/small ) degrees to evaluate the generalization of the proposed method . The ideal approach is to enumerate all the victim nodes and try our detection approach , but the computational cost would be too high . Therefore , we pick a subset of them randomly and evaluate our approach , and we think the subset size ( node degree : 20/10/6 ) is large enough to show the performance of our models . In addition , we have proposed a uniform pipeline which combines our detection algorithms and we updated the performance of the uniform pipeline in the revision section 4.2 . Q3 : [ Randomly adding edges ] In Section 3.1 and some other subsections , it seems to assume that the links in a given network are very clean but in reality there are a lot of noisy connections . How can we distinguish some random connections from malicious connections ? Evaluation along with this question will be also useful . A3 : We thank the reviewer for the interesting question . First , in our experiments , we do not explicitly assume the given network is clean . For instance , the citation network dataset Cora and Citeseer we use is extracted from the real world , and there is no guarantee that the network is clean . In addition , based on the suggestion , we added additional experiments in section 4.4 which explicitly randomly add edges to the graphs . In figure 4 we show that our proposed detection method will only detect malicious connections rather than the random ones . Q4 : [ The effect of SubGraphLinkPred is unclear ] In Section 3.2 , eventually , the ratio of malicious edges remains the same if the authors use random sampling . In that case , how SubGraphLinkPred helps is not very convincing . A4 : As long as the number of malicious edges is small , many subgraphs will contain no malicious edges at all . We hope that the link prediction model can learn better with these benign subgraphs , instead of simply learning on the large graph with malicious edges . In addition , we hope that the sampled small graphs will exhibit a similar pattern on which we can train a better graph neural network . In contrast , the single original graph is too large and therefore the pattern may be quite difficult to discover ."}, {"review_id": "HJxdAoCcYX-2", "review_text": "In this paper the authors present 4 methods for detecting outlier edges and nodes in graphs so as to prevent adversarial attacks on graph convolutional networks. They demonstrate that their methods are accurate (through high AUC) in detecting edges added by two previous adversarial detection methods. I think focusing on not just attacking GCNs but actually preventing them is awesome, and work of this sort should be highly lauded as I believe prevention is more difficult than attacks. That said, it is hard to tell how general this work is. The methods discussed follow fairly standard anomaly detection procedures (albeit with NN based models). However, this leaves a few key open questions: (1) To what degree do these methods address the particulars of GCN attacks? This could possibly be addressed by better recapping the GCN attacks and explaining how these methods directly relate to those attacks. (2) How robust are these methods? While the intuition behind the methods at a high level seems reasonable, it is unclear if they provide any real robustness to an adversary. Could the previous attacks be adapted if these detection mechanisms were known? For example, I expect that adding edges that are high likelihood and maximally change the victim label would be an effective deception technique. I believe a more thorough theoretical understanding of the robustness of the protection would make me more confident that these are broadly useful. As of now, it seems very much data dependent.
