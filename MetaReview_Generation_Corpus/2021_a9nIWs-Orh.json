The core idea is to not only use the output of the last Transformer layer for prediction , but let the model decide how to fuse the information from intermediate layers as well . To dynamically decide which intermediate layers to use depending on the input example , the model uses a mechanism conceptually similar to self-attention , which yields a normalized importance score for each layer . The importance-weighted sum then yields a complementary representation to the last layer . Lastly , another network produces a final , integrated representation from the output at the last layer and the complementary representation , which is then used for prediction . The model is evaluated on the GLUE benchmark . Strengths : The paper is well written and the experimental evaluation seems correct . The paper has a nice ablation study which shows that the learned importance scores , the complementary representations , and the fusion network are needed to reach the model 's full performance . Weaknesses : The main weakness is that the proposed extension to the baseline is relatively complex and rather heavy-weight in terms of new parameters ( introducing ~25 % more parameters compared to the baseline according to Table 2 ) , yet only achieves a very marginal relative improvement of 0.2 percent over the baseline . It seems likely that this improvement could be achieved through much simpler means , e.g. , additional self-attention layers on top of the last pretrained layer . This is supported by the fact that the paper 's analysis of the proposed importance score mechanism does n't show comprehensible patterns ( or the paper does n't talk about it ) . I lean slightly towards rejection , because , although the proposed model is reasonable and could have potential , the experiments do not currently demonstrate that potential , and I hence expect it hard for the community to learn from this paper . Questions : * You cite several papers which demonstrate that different layers of pretrained Transformers encode different information , which is the motivation for your architecture . However , the cited sources use a feature extracting approach , i.e. , they do n't fine tune the encoder on their target task . In the finetuning scenario ( yours ) , ca n't we expect the model to learn to simply forward the relevant information from intermediate layers to the last layer ? * In Section 5 you analyze which intermediate layers are used for which task . You state that we can see that the model learns to prefer different layers for each task , but do n't go into detail . Can you relate the nature of the task to the layers it produces ? For example , why does QNLI rely on layers 2-4 to some extent despite being a rather high-level understanding task ? * In Figure 2 , right side you observe that different examples tend to different layers . Did you qualitatively inspect the examples and try to find a pattern/link to their preferred intermediate layers ? Suggestions : * RoBERTa already achieves super-human results on the GLUE benchmark , meaning that it is probably already close to some upper limit . This makes it even more difficult for your model to substantially improve upon it .

But all the tasks in your experiments are evaluated on high-level natural language understanding tasks , which typically require representations at higher layers . This makes it more likely that your model does not improve much over the baseline , because the last layer will arguably already contain much of the information needed for the tasks . I think you should consider different tasks in your experiments to increase the chance of significant improvements . * In the current state , it is unclear whether your improvements are coming from the specific model you chose or merely from the fact that you added a lot of parameters .

The proposed method consists of two components . 1 ) Hidden representation extractor ( HIRE ) : a two-layer bi-GRU model summarizes the hidden representation of the encoder with a weighted-sum scheme . 2 ) Fusion network : combine the weighed representation with original representation via the bi-GRU model . The authors apply the proposed approach on top of RoBERTa and evaluated on general benchmark GLUE . The experimental results show that the proposed method could give moderate improvements over RoBERTa baseline system . The authors ' main contribution lies in two components : HIRE and fusion network . However , unfortunately , both components are not novel to me . 1 ) The idea of HIRE model is very similar to utilizing ELMo in down-stream tasks , where the hidden representations of each layer are weighted . 2 ) The central part of the fusion network utilizes a concatenation scheme of [ A ; B ; A+B ; A * B ] , which is also a widely used approach , similar to Chen et al . ( 2017 ) , Seo et al . ( 2017 ) , Hu et al . ( 2019 ) , etc . Besides the novelty of the proposed components , the experiments are also not well-designed . I assume the proposed method could apply to various pre-trained language models ( PLMs ) , as this is an approach that aims to apply on the fine-tuning stage . However , the authors only present the results on top of RoBERTa model , which can not demonstrate that the proposed model can be generally applied to various PLMs . I would suggest the authors evaluate their approach in a more general way , such as build on top of various PLMs , or apply on PLM in another language . These would have helped to better demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method . Considering the novelty and generalizability of the proposed method , I recommend rejection for this paper .
