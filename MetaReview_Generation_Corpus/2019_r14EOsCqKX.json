For (2), they study the effect of learning rate warmup using CCA, coming to the conclusion that learning rate warmup helps stabilize the fully connected layers. (3) They also study model distillation with CCA, finding out that the higher layers are the most similar to the teacher model. Clarity: The paper is clearly written, cites lots of relevant work, and describes the experiments in detail. Originality: This paper seems original, while the techniques used are established, they conduct thorough experiments on phenomena in deep learning that haven't been studied. Comments on Significance and Quality: I liked parts (2), (3) of the paper most, as it seemed like conclusions from these parts were fairly clear: Figures 4, 5 make the effect of warm restarts in the large batch setting on FC layers clear: the restarts help the layers stabilize better. I really liked the experiment in 4(d), where they tested this hypothesis by freezing the fully connected layers for the duration of the warmup. It was interesting to see that this had no effect on the remainder of the trajectory. This seemed to be a good demonstration and investigation of the effect of warm restarts, and I appreciate the tests on different architectures in the supplementary material. I'd be curious to see if there's some way to further incorporate this into learning rate schedules. I also liked Figure 6, exploring Model distillation, which showed that the higher layers of the shallower network were the most affected by the teacher network. The authors cite related work which suggests only training higher layers, and I'd be curious to see how only training higher layers affects accuracy. While I thought the experiments for part (1) SGD with Restarts were thorough, and appreciated Figure 1, which experimentally validated the use of mode connectivity, I felt there was some difficulty in interpreting the results. Firstly, in Figure 2, the claim is that SGD with Restarts does possibly bridge local minima as the mode connectivity curves increase between the two convergence points. However, we see in both 2(b) and 2(c) that the linear interpolation between both convergence points does *not* increase in loss. In which case is there any reason to believe that the increase of MC in the middle means that SGDR is climbing a basin? How do we know that the linear combination isn't closer to the path followed by SGDR? For additional comparisons, it would be good to have the linear combination plots for Figure 1 also. In general, it seems hard to make meaningful conclusions with low dimensional projections of a very high dimensional loss surface. We'd have to know some kind of theoretical property of MC to be able to do so. Minor Comments I think the figures in this paper could be much clearer. In Figure 2 for example, the legend blocks some of the main areas of interest of the plot. I would recommend cutting some of the raw learning rate figures and making all figures much bigger. In figure 4(d), the text describes the process in training steps (200 training steps), but the plot is in epochs -- it would be better if the text and axis were consistent in units. Conclusion: Despite my concerns on the first part of this paper, I think the very thorough experiments, clear presentation and the interesting results on learning rate warmups and model distillation merit its acceptance.
