The argument is that in remote sensing one often has access only to a subset of all possible images/channels, so it would be useful to get the same embedding for each subset depicting the same scene. The basic idea is to generate, during training, two versions of the same patch by randomly dropping out channels, and to penalise the difference between the two corresponding embeddings, using the InfoNCE loss. The latter ensures that the patch remains \"recognisable\" among a set of random non-matching patches, so as to avoid learning a trivial embedding that is the same for any input. The high-level goal, to train an encoder that always gives a similar encoding (and consequently similar downstream results) for a given patch, independent of the sensor channels used, is certainly appealing. It is also true that one would like to do this with unsupervised learning or transfer learning, since labelled data is scarce in remote sensing. Unfortunately, in my understanding the paper does not make much progress towards that goal. Novelty is limited, the work is a variation of the CMC method. Yes, it splits channels randomly, not by views; and uses a Siamese architecture, not separate encoders; which it can afford to do since there are no viewpoint differences. And it computes the loss at more than one layer - which is a fairly trivial and popular thing to do. Moreover it is not well justified in this case, since all that matters in a feed-forward architecture is that the final embeddings are similar. Constraining lower layers might empirically help - in particular speed up learning - but conceptually there is no reason to reduce the lower layers' capacity to somehow turn different inputs into the same output. If they are really very different (think RADAR images) this could in principle even hurt. Both in the discussion and in the experiments, I miss crucial and obvious baselines. First, it does in my view not make sense to use pre-trained ImageNet features as the only baseline. Yes, they are known to work surprisingly well also for remote sensing data - but, unsurprisingly, not nearly as well as pre-training on similar remote sensing images. A more natural baseline would be to pre-train on the same type of imagery, with a proxy task for which it is easy to get labels automatically - actually the paper implicitly suggests that labels from OpenStreetMap might be a good candidate. Beyond reducing the domain gap, this also has the advantage that one is not limited to 3 channels, and that one can use an architecture suitable for the task (e.g., standard architecture with a lot of pooling are known to not perform well for semantic segmentation of remote sensing data). Labels for supervised learning might in many remote sensing tasks be scarce, but to get any old labels and pre-train a reasonable proxy task is still easy, as map data is abundant. Perhaps even more important is another natural baseline. In spirit, the proposed method is closer to a generative embedding, since the supervision signal is not a discriminative task, but rather encourages embeddings to stay unique for each patch, and hence in principle fully decodable. Arguably, the most obvious way to achieve the same thing is a Siamese pair of auto-encoders for the two training patches, with an additional loss on the difference between the latent representations. Without that baseline it is impossible to tell whether the InfoNCE loss does a good job - in some sense it feels like making the task harder if one demands not only that a patch of water can be decoded from the embedding, but that it should be distinguishable from any other patch of water that resembles it even in raw pixel space. The data used in the experiments is somewhat unconvincing, as it is really the opposite of diverse, multi-modal remote sensing channels. The same four R-G-B-NIR channels from sensors with not so different resolutions. The claim that the method homes in on high-level similarity and overcomes low-level radiometric differences would be much more credible if one uses short-wave infrared, thermal, perhaps even Radar images. Moreover, the gains are disappointingly small: even in the best case of 12 channels, the improvement over ImageNet pre-training is roughly from 4.5/10 correct neighbours to 5/10 correct neighbours. The even lower gains with fewer channels underline the need to have a pre-trained baseline without a massive domain gap. The classification accuracy of kNN does improve with the proposed embedding (at least for some combinations - for Pleiades RGB it is the same), but that experiment is unnatural. If one has the labels to do kNN, one might as well use them to train a proper classifier, i.e., add a couple of fully connected layers and fine-tune in a supervised fashion. A number of technical details in the experiments remain unclear. Section 4.2 suggests the channels in Fig. 4 were added in a fixed order - why? There are many potentially viable combinations of, say, 4 channels, not just one. Furthermore, Fig. 5 suggests to me that the learned similarities are in fact not \"high-level\", but (up to rotation invariance) fairly low-level texture properties like \"homogeneous green patch\", \"bright straight line on dark background\", etc. I am not sure what suggests to the authors that there is much sensor invariance. Again, channels with really different wavelength would be more convincing here. In terms of presentation, the paper repeatedly makes strong, but unsupported claims about the special properties of remote sensing images. It makes no sense to state that standard pictures often have \"one subject\" - ImageNet does, but a look at standard datasets like Cityscapes or DepthInTheWild shows that it is not true in general. In the same vein, I don't see why the content changes more unpredictably at the same location across time - arguably the rate of change is much lower, because only large-scale changes impact the image, and because there aren't many dynamic occluders. And the \"distributional hypothesis\" certainly also holds for remote sensing images, just at different scale - otherwise people would not use all sorts of smoothness priors, super-pixel segmentations, etc. when working with them. And I do not understand why the adjacent-patch approach of CPC needs nearby patches to be similar - in my view it only requires that nearby patches are not conditionally independent, so basically any type of patterns. A small detail: some references, while not wrong, seem rather arbitrary. E.g., (Wu 2018) is a little-known random example. Why not use earlier, more standard references - for semantic segmentation of remote sensing data with deep learning one could for example think of (Maggiori, Audebert, Marmanis, Kampffmeyer, Sherrah, ...). Overall, while the paper brings up a valid question, it does not give a convincing answer. The justification of the method and its novelty is to some degree contrived, the dataset is ill-suited to really prove the point, and the natural baselines are missing.", "rating": "3: Weak Reject", "reply_text": "Anonymous reviewer # 2 , Thank you for writing an extensive and detailed review . > \u201c The high-level goal , to train an encoder that always gives a similar encoding [ ... ] independent of the sensor channels used , is certainly appealing \u201d We are glad that you see the appeal , but disagree that we do not make progress towards the goal .

", "rating": "3: Weak Reject", "reply_text": "Anonymous reviewer # 4 , Thanks for taking the time to write a thorough review . We \u2019 d like to respond to some parts of your review below . > \u201c The essential idea is to enforce similarity between representations of multiple views obtained by subsetting channels from multiple co-terminus sensor outputs . This is implemented by training with the InfoNCE loss on high-level features ( last two layers of a ResNet 50 ) of two views of the same image and multiple view of other images which are passed through the same weight-shared network. \u201d This is a good summary of our training procedure , but we \u2019 d like to emphasize that subsetting channels at training time serves not only to create multiple views for use with InfoNCE loss , but also trains the network to operate with channels missing at inference time . > \u201c The results show that [ . .. ] multiple low resolution sensors can outperform a higher resolution sensor \u201d We hadn \u2019 t emphasized this as a main result of the paper , but it is indeed interesting ; we \u2019 ll update the paper to reflect this . > \u201c The paper does not discuss why this is a good task ( is it challenging , is it representative of remote sensing applications , are these most frequent OSM classes ) . \u201d Thank you for pointing this out . We believe that the OSM classification task demands that a representation understand the kinds of objects and relationships useful for a broad range of remote sensing applications . We \u2019 ll add a section to the paper discussing this explicitly . > \u201c The paper makes a strong claim that the \u201c distributional hypothesis \u201d ( of expecting that spatial or temporal similarity reflect in representation similarity ) does not apply to satellite imagery because \u201c remote sensing imagery \u2026 can change abruptly between adjacent patches \u201d . No evidence is provided of what I believe is an unintuitive claim . Indeed , existing work [ 1 ] ( as cited in the paper ) uses this hypothesis to create representations for satellite images . Glaringly , having made the claim , the paper does not compare proposed approach with the representations computed in [ 1 ] . \u201d As we mention in our response to reviewer # 2 , we miscommunicated by saying that the distributional hypothesis does not hold at all for this imagery . Rather , it holds at a smaller scale than is useful to learn high-level representations ; nearby pixels correspond to the same object on a scale of roughly meters , which means that these correlations occupy only a few pixels for even high-resolution satellite imagery . We \u2019 ll update our paper to make this more clear . > \u201c The paper also makes the claim that computing representation loss should be done with high-level features rather than individual pixels . Again , this is not substantiated as the paper does not compare the proposed methods with simple auto-encoder baselines. \u201d Prior work in representation learning ( such as CPC , CMC , and AMDIM ) has shown that computing loss from high-level features is much more effective than using a pixel-level loss . You \u2019 re right that this section of our paper is lacking justification , though ; we \u2019 ll add these references and discussion to that section . > \u201c The evaluation leaves out several other expected experiments . A few suggested conditions for ablation tests are listed : ( a ) Different augmentation across channels ( b ) Different values of \\lambda_L ( only an extreme case of last two layers has been presented ) ( c ) At least one other CNN-backbone , perhaps a deeper ResNet ( d ) Different orderings of introducing the channels ( not only by low or high resolution ordering ) ( e ) Different sizes of the tiles for learning representations ( curiously the paper does not mention the size of the tiles as used currently ) \u201d We agree that these ablation tests would be helpful to understand how to get maximally discriminative features . However , as stated above , our main result is learning features which are stable across every subset of input sensors , and our experiments are targeted at demonstrating that result . > \u201c Finally , and more broadly , the proposed approach aims to compensate the lack of supervised labels by exploiting redundancy across multiple sensors/channels . In the chosen setup , this redundancy is very high as 4 different RGBI co-terminus sensors are chosen , thereby requiring augmenting and drop-out to simulate some variation . A more realistic or challenging setup would be required to evaluate the underlying ideas. \u201d We agree that adding more distinct sensors would be beneficial , and believe this represents an exciting direction for future research . In particular , we think that adding sensor diversity should improve representation quality . As mentioned in our response to reviewer # 2 , we chose data sources with high mutual information for this research because our approach relies on maximizing mutual information across views .

The paper is well-written and the method is clearly explained. To my knowledge there is little prior work on unsupervised/self-supervised learning on remote sensing/satellite data and this data suits the contrastive/multiview framework very well.

We \u2019 d like to point out that recent work in semi-supervised learning ( e.g .

The argument is that in remote sensing one often has access only to a subset of all possible images/channels, so it would be useful to get the same embedding for each subset depicting the same scene. The basic idea is to generate, during training, two versions of the same patch by randomly dropping out channels, and to penalise the difference between the two corresponding embeddings, using the InfoNCE loss. The latter ensures that the patch remains \"recognisable\" among a set of random non-matching patches, so as to avoid learning a trivial embedding that is the same for any input. The high-level goal, to train an encoder that always gives a similar encoding (and consequently similar downstream results) for a given patch, independent of the sensor channels used, is certainly appealing. It is also true that one would like to do this with unsupervised learning or transfer learning, since labelled data is scarce in remote sensing. Unfortunately, in my understanding the paper does not make much progress towards that goal. Novelty is limited, the work is a variation of the CMC method. Yes, it splits channels randomly, not by views; and uses a Siamese architecture, not separate encoders; which it can afford to do since there are no viewpoint differences. And it computes the loss at more than one layer - which is a fairly trivial and popular thing to do. Moreover it is not well justified in this case, since all that matters in a feed-forward architecture is that the final embeddings are similar. Constraining lower layers might empirically help - in particular speed up learning - but conceptually there is no reason to reduce the lower layers' capacity to somehow turn different inputs into the same output. If they are really very different (think RADAR images) this could in principle even hurt. Both in the discussion and in the experiments, I miss crucial and obvious baselines. First, it does in my view not make sense to use pre-trained ImageNet features as the only baseline. Yes, they are known to work surprisingly well also for remote sensing data - but, unsurprisingly, not nearly as well as pre-training on similar remote sensing images. A more natural baseline would be to pre-train on the same type of imagery, with a proxy task for which it is easy to get labels automatically - actually the paper implicitly suggests that labels from OpenStreetMap might be a good candidate. Beyond reducing the domain gap, this also has the advantage that one is not limited to 3 channels, and that one can use an architecture suitable for the task (e.g., standard architecture with a lot of pooling are known to not perform well for semantic segmentation of remote sensing data). Labels for supervised learning might in many remote sensing tasks be scarce, but to get any old labels and pre-train a reasonable proxy task is still easy, as map data is abundant. Perhaps even more important is another natural baseline. In spirit, the proposed method is closer to a generative embedding, since the supervision signal is not a discriminative task, but rather encourages embeddings to stay unique for each patch, and hence in principle fully decodable. Arguably, the most obvious way to achieve the same thing is a Siamese pair of auto-encoders for the two training patches, with an additional loss on the difference between the latent representations. Without that baseline it is impossible to tell whether the InfoNCE loss does a good job - in some sense it feels like making the task harder if one demands not only that a patch of water can be decoded from the embedding, but that it should be distinguishable from any other patch of water that resembles it even in raw pixel space. The data used in the experiments is somewhat unconvincing, as it is really the opposite of diverse, multi-modal remote sensing channels. The same four R-G-B-NIR channels from sensors with not so different resolutions. The claim that the method homes in on high-level similarity and overcomes low-level radiometric differences would be much more credible if one uses short-wave infrared, thermal, perhaps even Radar images. Moreover, the gains are disappointingly small: even in the best case of 12 channels, the improvement over ImageNet pre-training is roughly from 4.5/10 correct neighbours to 5/10 correct neighbours. The even lower gains with fewer channels underline the need to have a pre-trained baseline without a massive domain gap. The classification accuracy of kNN does improve with the proposed embedding (at least for some combinations - for Pleiades RGB it is the same), but that experiment is unnatural. If one has the labels to do kNN, one might as well use them to train a proper classifier, i.e., add a couple of fully connected layers and fine-tune in a supervised fashion. A number of technical details in the experiments remain unclear. Section 4.2 suggests the channels in Fig. 4 were added in a fixed order - why? There are many potentially viable combinations of, say, 4 channels, not just one. Furthermore, Fig. 5 suggests to me that the learned similarities are in fact not \"high-level\", but (up to rotation invariance) fairly low-level texture properties like \"homogeneous green patch\", \"bright straight line on dark background\", etc. I am not sure what suggests to the authors that there is much sensor invariance. Again, channels with really different wavelength would be more convincing here. In terms of presentation, the paper repeatedly makes strong, but unsupported claims about the special properties of remote sensing images. It makes no sense to state that standard pictures often have \"one subject\" - ImageNet does, but a look at standard datasets like Cityscapes or DepthInTheWild shows that it is not true in general. In the same vein, I don't see why the content changes more unpredictably at the same location across time - arguably the rate of change is much lower, because only large-scale changes impact the image, and because there aren't many dynamic occluders. And the \"distributional hypothesis\" certainly also holds for remote sensing images, just at different scale - otherwise people would not use all sorts of smoothness priors, super-pixel segmentations, etc. when working with them. And I do not understand why the adjacent-patch approach of CPC needs nearby patches to be similar - in my view it only requires that nearby patches are not conditionally independent, so basically any type of patterns. A small detail: some references, while not wrong, seem rather arbitrary. E.g., (Wu 2018) is a little-known random example. Why not use earlier, more standard references - for semantic segmentation of remote sensing data with deep learning one could for example think of (Maggiori, Audebert, Marmanis, Kampffmeyer, Sherrah, ...). Overall, while the paper brings up a valid question, it does not give a convincing answer. The justification of the method and its novelty is to some degree contrived, the dataset is ill-suited to really prove the point, and the natural baselines are missing.", "rating": "3: Weak Reject", "reply_text": "Anonymous reviewer # 2 , Thank you for writing an extensive and detailed review . > \u201c The high-level goal , to train an encoder that always gives a similar encoding [ ... ] independent of the sensor channels used , is certainly appealing \u201d We are glad that you see the appeal , but disagree that we do not make progress towards the goal .
