SUMMARY OF REVIEW This paper motivates the need to \"contextualize\" responses based on the query to bring about stable training in NRG and consequently proposes localGAN to realize this. On the overall, I like the motivation and the proposed approach of this paper. The experimental results also look convincing. On the flip side, the technical formulation and theoretical results are not presented rigorously and important technical details are missing, as discussed below. As a result, clarifications from the authors are needed to ensure the correctness of their formulation. The authors also need to improve the presentation and proof of the theoretical results; the correctness has to be checked again. In my opinion, these theoretical results do not improve my current assessment of the paper and can be removed to cut down to 8 pages. If the authors like to keep them, they need to revise them based on my concerns above. It would be good to show some sample queries and corresponding \"meaningful\" responses produced by their proposed LocalGAN that are not considered safe responses which are produced by the other tested methods. DETAILED COMMENTS For Lemmas 1 and 2 and Theorem 1, the authors need to present them rigorously by specifying the exact math expressions since they have not defined what it means by sufficient, approximates, small enough, and estimate properly. This will also eliminate any discrepancy in their interpretations. For example, the authors have used Taylor series expansion to approximate the expectation of F(q,r) in equation 19 (instead of bounding it). Hence, one can claim that Lemma 2 does not hold and hence Theorem 1 does not hold as well. In Section 4.3, the described mechanism is confusing to me: (a) Are the authors saying that it is performed sequentially from foundation to phase-1, followed by phase-2? Or are the authors saying that these three phases are expected behaviors occurring during the optimization in equation 17? (b) For the foundation phase, is the DBM pre-trained, that is, prior to optimization in equation 17? (c) Are there multiple response clusters, that is, one for each q? If so, the second RELU term in the minimizing criterion in equation 17 does not seem to properly reflect this. (d) How are the response cluster centers r_c exactly determined? The authors vaguely say that they are modeled from training data. Is it one center per response cluster? Are the cluster centers also optimized in equation 17, besides the generator's weights? Can the authors provide the argument under the min operator in equation 17? It is confusing to leave out r_c from the subscript of alpha. I would have preferred that the authors specify the expression of the evaluation metrics to be self-contained. In Fig. 2, how exactly do the authors measure stability? If the entropy rapidly increases like that of LocalGAN and Adver-REGS, are they considered stable? Minor issues Page 1: Despite of? Page 3: inequation? Page 3: Equation 4 and 5? Equation 6: The first summation should just be over q, unless there are multiple sets of R_q per q. tilde{R}_q is not used in equation 6. Page 4: a limited samples? Page 5: defined in 3.2?

The key observation is that for a given query, there always exists a group of diverse responses that are reasonable, rather than a single ground-truth response. Therefore, the local semantic distribution of responses given a query should be modeled. Besides the original GAN loss, the proposed LocalGAN adds an additional local-distribution-oriented objective, resulting in a hybrid loss for training, which claims to achieve better performance on response generation datasets. Strengths: I think the proposed model contains some good intuitions, that is, the generated responses should be modeled as a local distribution, rather than a single ground-truth output during training. The motivation of this paper is therefore clear. Experimental results in Table 1 seems encouraging. However, I would have to say that the current draft is poorly presented. There are a lot of unclear parts that should be more carefully clarified, with details below.

The authors take advantage of an energy based model to measure the distance between a predicted response and the center of all qualified responses. The training process becomes a hybrid one with the original loss function in the beginning followed by the loss that pulls the response to the center of the response cluster later. In general the paper is well written, with experiments clearly showcased improved training stabilities. However, one major flaw in the experiments in that the authors almost only compared diversity measures such as Dist-1, Dist-2 and Ent4. These measures did not take into consideration the matches between the predicted one and the ground truth. The only relevance measure used in this paper is the Rel., which the authors defined as the average of embedding distances. Such a measure is by no means an objective measure and can't really demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in terms of generating responses that are close to the ground truth. The authors would need to submit results on one of the widely adopted benchmark metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROGUE) or their equivalents in order to demonstrate the quality of the generated response.

The authors take advantage of an energy based model to measure the distance between a predicted response and the center of all qualified responses. The training process becomes a hybrid one with the original loss function in the beginning followed by the loss that pulls the response to the center of the response cluster later. In general the paper is well written, with experiments clearly showcased improved training stabilities. However, one major flaw in the experiments in that the authors almost only compared diversity measures such as Dist-1, Dist-2 and Ent4. These measures did not take into consideration the matches between the predicted one and the ground truth. The only relevance measure used in this paper is the Rel., which the authors defined as the average of embedding distances. Such a measure is by no means an objective measure and can't really demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in terms of generating responses that are close to the ground truth. The authors would need to submit results on one of the widely adopted benchmark metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROGUE) or their equivalents in order to demonstrate the quality of the generated response. And this is the main reason of my rating recommendation. ", "rating": "1: Reject", "reply_text": "We must clarify that , actually , there have been a number of studies drawing the apparent conclusion that the word-overlap based metrics ( BLEU , ROUGE ) are not suitable for evaluating the relevance of the results given by the open-domain NRG models [ 1-3 ] . Moreover , it is the embedding-based similarity that can be taken to replace the metrics like BLEU and ROUGE ( or at least as the equivalent of them ) in the NRG task [ 4-9 ] . Meanwhile , the Rel . metric used in our draft is actually the sum of the three embedding-base similarities ( greedy , average , extreme ) [ 2 ] , rather than `` ... the authors defined as the average of embedding distances ... '' . The relevance-oriented metric is explicitly detailed in Subsection 5.1 , Page 8 in our paper . To further conduct thorough comparisons , we have added the human evaluation results in the revised version . The human evaluation is believed to be a meaningful supplement for illustrating the capabilities of NRG models .
