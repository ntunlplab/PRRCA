[ R1.1 our response ] To be precise we are not comparing our method to the full covariance , which would not be tractable in our settings ( the full covariance scales quadratically with respect to the total number of network parameters ) . Instead , we are comparing our method to the full parametrization of the diagonal covariance , i.e. , the standard mean-field approximation . Our method is a further factorization of the diagonal covariance in the parameter space . See Figure 6 for a visual representation of this explanation .

For this model , the measurements show that the k-tied Normal posterior does not decrease the evaluation speed when compared to the standard parameterization of the GMFVI . This experiment can be replicated using the Colab notebook in [ 1 ] . We updated the end of section 3.2 and Appendix D to include these results . More generally , we do not expect a significant change in the evaluation speed of each step when using the k-tied Normal posterior . The biggest additional operation per step when using the k-tied Normal posterior compared to the standard parameterization is the UV^T multiplication to materialize the posterior standard deviations matrix A , where U \\in R^ { m \\times k } , V \\in R^ { m \\times k } and A \\in R^ { m \\times n } . The time complexity of this operations is O ( kmn ) . This time complexity is usually negligible when compared to the complexity of data-weight matrix multiplication with time complexity of O ( bmn ) , where b is the batch size .

If just focusing on the diagonal covariance, it already throws away the full covariance. Low-rank won't help much with improving the posterior distribution. ", "rating": "3: Weak Reject", "reply_text": "[ R1.1 ] The paper proposes a low-rank approximation to the diagonal of Gaussian mean field posterior which reduces the number of parameters to fit . They show that the predictive performance does n't drop much compared with the full covariance but the number of parameters is significantly reduced . [ R1.1 our response ] To be precise we are not comparing our method to the full covariance , which would not be tractable in our settings ( the full covariance scales quadratically with respect to the total number of network parameters ) . Instead , we are comparing our method to the full parametrization of the diagonal covariance , i.e. , the standard mean-field approximation . Our method is a further factorization of the diagonal covariance in the parameter space . See Figure 6 for a visual representation of this explanation . [ R1.2 ] Why Matrix normal distribution is related to k-tied Normal distribution when k=1 . When k=1 , the rank of UV^\\top is 1 . The covariance is matrix normal is U\\otimes V , whose rank is rank ( U ) rank ( V ) . Also MN has a full covariance for the Gaussian approximation , not mean field . MN is only equal to 1-tied when only diagonal row and column covariances are considered . If that 's what the paper means , k-tied is only compared to MN with diagonal row and column covariances . Better make this point clear . [ R1.2 our response ] We thank the reviewer for the comment . We changed the sentence below from our paper as suggested by the reviewer to make the comparison with the Matrix normal distribution clearer : `` < MN distribution > is related to our k-tied Normal distribution when k = 1 '' - > `` < MN distribution > is related to our k-tied Normal distribution with $ k=1 $ when MN uses diagonal row and column covariances . '' We have also added a figure ( see Figure 6 ) to clarify this explanation . [ R1.3 ] Figure 4 should show running time instead of training step . I do n't think low-rank approximation is gon na influence the convergence that much . It should affect the evaluation speed of each step . [ R1.3 our response ] We measured the evaluation speed of each step for a simple model with 2 dense layers [ 0 ] . For this model , the measurements show that the k-tied Normal posterior does not decrease the evaluation speed when compared to the standard parameterization of the GMFVI . This experiment can be replicated using the Colab notebook in [ 1 ] . We updated the end of section 3.2 and Appendix D to include these results . More generally , we do not expect a significant change in the evaluation speed of each step when using the k-tied Normal posterior . The biggest additional operation per step when using the k-tied Normal posterior compared to the standard parameterization is the UV^T multiplication to materialize the posterior standard deviations matrix A , where U \\in R^ { m \\times k } , V \\in R^ { m \\times k } and A \\in R^ { m \\times n } . The time complexity of this operations is O ( kmn ) . This time complexity is usually negligible when compared to the complexity of data-weight matrix multiplication with time complexity of O ( bmn ) , where b is the batch size .

It feels like a standard trick people would do when fitting parameters for large matrices , i.e.exploring the low-rank structure and fitting the factorized matrices . Matrix normal is more significant since it reduces the number of parameters as well as maintaining a full covariance matrix with structures . If just focusing on the diagonal covariance , it already throws away the full covariance . Low-rank wo n't help much with improving the posterior distribution . [ R1.4 our response ] We acknowledge that MN covers more expressive posterior distribution . However , the goal of our paper is not to investigate richer posterior distributions , beyond mean-field . Instead , we start from the observation that scaling up mean-field and making it more robust is still a challenging problem ( [ 0 ] ) . We try to tackle this problem by reducing the number of parameters to optimize -- -while maintaining a comparable predictive behavior -- -and obtaining less noisy gradient estimates .
