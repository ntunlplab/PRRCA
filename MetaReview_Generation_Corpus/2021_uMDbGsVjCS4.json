The method uses generative models for sequences of images (conditional GANs with spatial and temporal discriminators), that take into account both the multiplicity of realisations given the same conditioning (via adversarial losses) and the spatial frequencies of the modeled surfaces using an evaluation in the Fourier domain, and that also allow training without paired low- and high-resolution samples by relying on a generative losses applied to the downsampled reconstruction. As demonstrated on synthetic 2D data or on 3D frames showing particle simulations, the proposed method can generate images with high-frequency content.\n\nReviewers have praised the intuition of using GANs for modeling high-frequency features in physical simulation reconstruction. Weaknesses included:\n* insufficient analysis and explanation of the Fourier-domain supervision\n* limited novelty w.r.t. TempoGAN (with the exception of frequency-based evaluation) and lack of evaluation on more general tasks\n* unconvincing results with marginal improvement over plain MSE loss\n* missing ablation studies\n* toy dataset evaluation only, which makes this work seem preliminary\n\nThis paper comes out as 6/7 in my AC stack and I will unfortunately recommend to reject it, hoping that the authors will resubmit an improved version, taking into account the reviewers\u2019 suggestions, for an upcoming conference or for a journal venue.\n", "reviews": [{"review_id": "uMDbGsVjCS4-0", "review_text": "The authors propose to use the same formulation of adversarial losses over space and time as done by Xie et . al.The block-wise frequency evaluation is a new contribution of the paper .
