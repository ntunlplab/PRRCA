This reformulation allows to train a recurrent neural network of spiking neural network with good performances.

The results in Table 1 and 2 are the performance of the rescaling technique for over 100 sample networks per data point for deep and wide networks .

There is literature that proves that the specific neuron model is functional [ 6 , 7 ] . Moreover , a CMOS mixed-signal circuit implementation for the neuron model has been published in the paper that the reviewer cited [ 1 ] . b.Implementing several hundred neurons on a chip is a complex and expensive task . Such a system is always designed by first simulating them on transient circuit simulators based on SPICE or similar . The Python simulator is exactly that . This is standard practice in any mixed-signal circuit design in the industry and academia . We created a new simulator to allow ease of integration to the Python-based NN frameworks !
