Additionally , our empirical results on measuring the gradients on unpermuted versus permuted examples suggests that permuted labels contribute strongly to the training in all layers in the later epochs , perhaps owing to the increased nonlinearity of the network after many epochs of training .

These results are obtained using the MFTMA framework , a manifold analysis tool , testing geometric properties of individual layers .

This paper does not propose any new algorithm , but instead settles some important questions by infirming or affirming past speculation on layer behaviour found in the literature . I find three particularly interesting results in this paper : - later layers seem to be responsible for memorization , while early layers seem to converge last but consistently learn `` generalizing '' features ( although this may not be true for other architectures ) - increasing the dimensionality of the network to induce double descent _decreases_ the manifold dimensionality of the last layer . This is consistent with overparameterization making everything smoother/flatter and more easily disentangleable in the last layer . - for examples with the wrong class , gradients initially vanish ( due to destructive interference ) , which seems to be a driving force for the initial good generalization performance .

Although , MFTMA could be a better explained in the main paper . # # # Pros : - As stated above , the paper makes interesting observation regarding memorization of deep network . - It performs a thorough empirical study . # # # Cons : - I found it hard to understand MFTMA without referring to the appendix A . It would be nice to expand the explanation of MFTMA in the main paper . In addition , it would be good to further explain Fig 1 .

It would be nice to expand the explanation of MFTMA in the main paper . In addition , it would be good to further explain Fig 1 . B which contains a lot of information . `` * * We agree with the reviewers that the explanation of the MFTMA method in the main text should be expanded . In the posted revision , we used some of the additional page to further explain this technique and the intuition behind it . We also expanded the size of Fig.1.B for better readability , and in the next iteration , we plan to expand the explanation about Figure 1B to give intuition behind the manifold radius , dimension , and capacity quantities and how they are computed . - * * '' Does the observation scale to larger dataset such as ImageNet ? `` * * To demonstrate this , we also include results on the Tiny ImageNet which is larger than CIFAR100 both in the amount of data and in the size of the images . We also note that the behaviors we see when training without label noise on these datasets are similar to the trends observed when training on ImageNet without label noise , which can be seen in https : //www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-14578-5 . - * * '' Experiments are run for only one seed . `` * * We ran all our experiments with 10 random seeds , which varied the network initialization , the selection and labeling of the permuted examples , and the initialization of the MFTMA calculations . In most cases we found that our results were not very sensitive to this seed , hence error bars on our plots are fairly small and easy to miss . We will clarify this bit of methodology in the main text ."}, "3": {"review_id": "V8jrrnwGbuc-3", "review_text": "The authors apply MFTMA to DNNs trained on CIFAR with label noise to analyze their behaviors between generalization and memorization .

We also wish to thank the reviewer for giving our manuscript such careful attention and finding a mislabeled figure in the supplemental information which we have corrected . Below , we respond to some of the questions the reviewer had : - * * '' Why do the authors consider only convolutional layers , not fully-connected layers , for the analyses ? In the experiment of rewinding individual layers , the three FC layers are left untouched . Why ? `` * * As is typical for image classification networks , most of the architectures we analyzed ( AlexNet , and both of the ResNets ) are constructed from purely convolutional , normalization , and pooling layers with a single FC layer at the output , while only VGG16 has a series of 3 FC layers before the output . For consistency across all networks we show results after convolutional layers or pooling layers , both of which can change the capacity while normalization layers can \u2019 t . For the experiment of rewinding layers , we show the convolutional layers we analyzed with MFTMA for easier comparison with the MFTMA results . As the reviewer notes , rewinding the FC layers in VGG16 is a good suggestion since we see very little change in these layers across training , perhaps corresponding to the small gradients we see for these layers in Fig.5.The rewinding experiments are running , and we will update the Si when ready . - * * '' Is MFTMA the only method that can examine/verify the above finding ? `` * * To our knowledge , MFTMA is currently the only method that can capture the relevant manifold geometry for classification . The creation of other/better methods of measuring the representational geometry is an important , though challenging , direction for further work in our view . - * * '' Comments . At the first reading , I did n't understand what `` restored examples '' means , and it took me a while to understand it . The caption for Fig.A.7 has an error ; CIFAR100 should be Tiny ImageNet . `` * * Thank you for catching the error ! We will correct them in the updated manuscript . We will also add clarifying explanations for 'restored examples ' in the updated version ."}}
