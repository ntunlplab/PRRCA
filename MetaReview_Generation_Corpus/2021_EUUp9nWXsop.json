The resulting learnt policies can successfully transfer between the related datasets . Strong points : - This paper focuses on the important problem and attempts to provide a simple solution that leverages the prior knowledge about the problem ( existing heuristic solutions ) while being data-driven . - The experimental studies are quite informative and detailed and provide analysis of the behaviour of the proposed solution . - The proposed method outperformed the presented baselines in most cases . - The experiments with policy transfer between different datasets seem very interesting and focus on the realistic and important setting . - The experiments with ablations by excluding various experts are informative and insightful . Weak points : - The novelty of the proposed method is not very strong : The main idea is to select the best behaviour among several heuristics , that was explored before ( Hsu & Lin , 2015 , 1 , 2 , 3 ) , the learning mechanism relies on imitation learning , that was also explored in previous works for AL ( Liu et al , 2018 ) , and the implementation in terms of state parametrization seem to be similar to previous works too ( Contardo et al , 2017 , Konyushkova et al. , 2017 , Liu et al , 2018 ) . - This paper puts an emphasis on the batch nature of the proposed method ( for example , when contrasting against the related work ) . However , I did not understand how the policy training is particularly targeted to the batch setting . - The nature of the proposed method is the most similar to the algorithms that select a particular heuristic to use at each step of the training . While the authors mention some of such algorithms ( Hsu & Lin , 2015 ) , I believe a few others works deserve some attention [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] . Importantly , there is no comparison to the methods from this group . - The authors claim that the imitation learning is done by the DAGGER method . However , as far as I understand , DAGGER makes an assumption that an expert can provide an optimal action from any state as supervision . If I understand the method correctly , such an assumption can not be satisfied in the setting of the paper . To my mind , it sounds that the method is closer to supervised learning with epsilon-greedy data collection . - Most experiments are performed on rather low dimensional data in MNIST , FMINST and KMNIST . The transfer to more complex datasets such as CIFAR is shown in the appendix , but the gains by the proposed method seem to be marginal . I am leaning towards the rejection of this paper in the light of limited novelty of the presented method and limited gains especially on more complex realistic datasets . Questions : - Section 4.4 contains a curious and counter-intuitive observation : `` there is an upper limit to the size of D_ { such } after which performance degrades again '' . However , the authors did not provide any explanation of this phenomena . Why is this happening ? - Could the authors elaborate a bit more on the connection between the proposed learning mechanism and DAGGER ? - I think the most significant part of the method is the ways how the training data is collected with supervision of the experts . While this procedure is covered in section 3.3 , I think it deserves a bit more attention . For example , I am still not sure if and how * batches * of data are selected by heuristics strategies . - Why do the authors say that the method is closer to the baselines `` towards the end obviously '' ? Is the most of the data labelled at that point ? - The learning curves in many experiments seem to be quite noisy . How many experiments are averaged ? - How do the baselines compare to the proposed method with varying batch size ( as some methods are particularly targeted to batch size=1 or large batch size > 100 ) ? Additional comments : - The language in the paper often uses unusual word ordering and constructions that makes it difficult to read . For example , `` as ideally we label '' , `` besides the above mentioned '' , `` do still not work on batches '' . - A lot of experimental results are presented by training and testing the policy on the same dataset .

We have extended the discussion of [ 2 ] with the additionally provided related work . Related work [ 1,2,3 ] in the multi-armed bandit ( MAB ) context estimates the benefits of choosing one AL heuristic from an ensemble over another via a test accuracy approximation . They use Classification Entropy Maximization or ( modified ) Importance-Weighted Accuracy . In contrast , we learn a unified policy that performs selections faster than a set of in-parallel executed heuristics , that learns to interpolate between AL heuristics ( see Fig.4 ) and that exploits the classifiers ' internal state , and thus is especially suitable for deep learning models . - Related work that deals with the parameterization of the state : The state we propose extends existing work ( Contardo et al. , 2017 , Konyushkova et al. , 2017 , Liu et al. , 2018 ) ) , especially for deep models , and our initial submission shows the clear performance benefits ( see Appendix 4.3 Fig.13 ) : Our proposed state composition includes approximations of the classifier 's learning progress of the dataset , i.e. , the uncertainty of different clusters of data . The state measures data distribution and expected model-change : We use the classifier 's gradients at an embedding layer in order to measure the uncertainty of unlabeled data and its diversity , given pseudo-labels ( compare Ash et al.2020 ) .Further questions : - Why do the authors say that the method is closer to the baselines \u201d towards the end obviously \u201d ? Is the most of the data labelled at that point ? -- Towards the end enough representative samples are labeled . We updated the text accordingly . - How does policy training target the batch setting ? Batch data selection in Sec.3.3 -- The IALE policy learns to select diverse , uncertain batches by imitating AL heuristics that select batches . We have clarified that in Sec.3.3.- DAGGER 's optimal action assumption -- We agree with the reviewer on DAGGER 's optimal action constraint , and reformulate Sec.3.3 accordingly . We build on the intuition behind DAgger , and iteratively build a dataset that we use for supervised training . This is in line with similar work in various applications in which the requirement for an optimal supervisor is relaxed as well [ 4,5,6 ] . - Large $ D_ { sub } $ degenerates performance -- We have clarified this observation in Sec.4.4 : `` [ the decrease in performance with large $ D_ { sub } $ ] could be because random sub-sampling actually simplifies the selection of diverse , uncertain samples '' , i.e.selection-bias is implicitly reduced by random sub-sampling . - How many repetitions per experiment ? -- We added information on this to the submission .
