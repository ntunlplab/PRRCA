By breaking down the end-to-end distillation objective into blocks, the proposed method enables faster distillation when applied to model compression and block-wise architecture search. Several concerns of reviewers were addressed during the rebuttal period by the authors.\n\nHowever, there are still some concerns among the reviewers after the discussion:\n\n1) Computational cost-benefit of the proposed KD method seems marginal in comparison to the baseline, given that we still have to train all the neighborhoods in parallel and potentially to fine-tune in the end. \n\n2) It was brought up by a couple of the reviewers that the experiments lack diversity. It would be great to a clearly defined metric applied to a wide variety of the model architectures and datasets. It will also strengthen the paper by providing more details on the experiments.\n\nThe basic idea is interesting, but the paper needs further development and modification for publishing. \n\n", "reviews": [{"review_id": "poH5qibNFZ-0", "review_text": "This paper introduces Neighbourhood Distillation ( ND ) , a new training pipeline for knowledge distillation ( KD ) , which splits the student network into smaller neighbourhoods and trains them independently .

One can distill a ResNet-1000 with 1000 GPUs in parallel and it would take the same wall time as training a ResNet-50 with 50 GPUs . The scale-up doesn \u2019 t happen with regular Knowledge Distillation because : 1 . The asynchronous nature of training with multiple GPUs means that there are diminishing returns on adding more GPUs , and in practice one does n't see any speed improvement by using more than 50 GPUs . 2.When training synchronously , one needs to co-locate the GPUs which again limits the parallelism . * d ) In the equations such ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) , many notations or terms are not clarified . * * We will clarify in the text : For equation 1 : $ F_i $ is the flattened feature dimension of activation at layer i. Fo equation 3 : $ x $ is the image input of a network , $ y $ is the real label , $ \\tau $ is the temperature used to soften the logit outputs as is commonly used for Knowledge Distillation . The notation $ \\hat ( y ) ^S_\\tau $ is defined in the second line of equation 3 . It 's a shortcut for the predictions obtained from network $ S $ after smoothing the logits with temperature $ \\tau $ . $ \\cal { S } $ and $ \\cal { T } $ are defined in the text that precedes the equation and refer to the student and teacher network respectively"}}
