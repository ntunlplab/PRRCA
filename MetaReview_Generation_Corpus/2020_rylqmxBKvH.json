The reviewers agree that the problem is interesting, the paper is well written, and that the proposed approach is reasonable. However, after the discussion phase the critical point raised by AnonReviewer1 remains: in principle, when applying different corruptions in each step, the model is able to see the entire video over the duration of the training. This coupled with the strong assumptions on the mask distribution makes it questionable whether the approach should be considered unsupervised. Given that the results of the supervised methods significantly outperform the unsupervised ones, this issue needs to be carefully addressed to provide a clear and convincing selling point. Hence, I will recommend rejection and encourage the authors to address the remaining issues (the answers in the rebuttal are a good starting point).", "reviews": [{"review_id": "rylqmxBKvH-0", "review_text": "This paper proposes a GAN based approach for unsupervised video inpainting. The idea is to learn an auto encoder to reconstruct the unoccluded regions of the frames, and reuse the autoencoder as the generator for a video GAN, which discriminates between real noisy videos and generated videos masked by a known mask distribution. To me the general idea is a straightforward application of GANs to the general inpainting/denoising problem, with the novelty being 1) not relying on paired or unpaired references and 2) extension to the video domain. The main critique I have is that the work seems incomplete and does not show great empirical results, which makes this work a much weaker contribution. Obviously, the authors should complete the experimental results on baseline method 2.

Another limitation of this work is that a known mask distribution is assumed, while this might be a reasonable assumption in some cases, it can also be easily violated in real world problems. It'd be great improvement if such an assumption can be relaxed, for example, assuming a family of mask distributions but not the exact instantiation.

We provide below some clarifications . - Comments on the Experiments We tried hard to perform the experiments for baseline ( 2 ) [ 1 ] . We here explain in detail its results shown in tables 1 and 2 . [ 1 ] searches for the nearest neighbours of an occluded area using an Approximate Nearest Neighbor ( ANN ) search with the PatchMatch algorithm [ 11 ] . The occluded area is then reconstructed by assembling information from these neighbors at multiple scales . To initialize the algorithm , PatchMatch needs to find a valid initial guess for each occluded pixel , which indicates where to find the corresponding patch in the sequence . This initialization will not terminate until every occluded pixel is pointed to a patch who does not include any other occluded pixel . Since [ 1 ] specifically looks for rectangular cuboids of video information , it is extremely well adapted for the Moving-Vertical-Bar and thus performs well . However , for more general complex types of noise such as Raindrops , Remove-Pixel , and Cloud noises , it can not work properly . More precisely , it remains blocked in the search for relevant candidate patches for the occluded pixels . This means that no matter how hard it tries , it can not complete the task . The absence of the experiment results for [ 1 ] in tables 1 and 2 is due to this issue and not to insufficient running time . For example , we also tried with very small patches ( 3x3x3 ) , a reasonable minimum size for spatiotemporal patches , the algorithm still remains blocked and is then unable to terminate .

We provide below clarifications for your questions . 1 ) You are right , a different mask is applied at different time steps . This mask could be time independent ( as in Remove-Pixel noise ) or time-dependent ( for the three other noises : Raindrops , Moving-Vertical-Bar and Cloud noises ) . The underlying hypothesis is that in many practical situations , the noise is a dynamic and time-evolving process . Alternatively , we could have considered a fixed noise pattern per sequence , in which case our formalism is still valid , or a fixed noise pattern for all the sequences , in which case it is not applicable anymore ( because of the non stochasticity of the noise position process ) . Note that our hypothesis is similar to the one used in the classical data imputation setting in statistics [ 6 , 7 ] , for non dynamic data . This is also the usual assumption in the GAN literature ( again on still data ) : for example in [ 8 , 9 ] the missing data process is supposed to be stochastic in the sense that the position of the missing data follows a given distribution . The model will then have a chance of observing the whole data distribution , provided it has access to enough data . The problem is still considered unsupervised because there is no direct supervision , be it paired ( noisy image , ground truth image ) or unpaired noisy sequences and ground truth sequences without direct correspondence between the two types of sequences . More details are provided below . ( a ) Unsupervised versus supervised : Your remark is perfectly relevant since given enough data , one can imagine that the model will have access to the whole information from the videos . However , i ) this would require an extremely large number of observed sequences , ii ) this is an extremely complex task when no guidance or prior is provided to the model . For unsupervised inpainting , the model has to discover by itself which information is relevant for the reconstruction ( in this case local spatiotemporal information ) . In [ 1 , 2 ] , for example , the inpainter is trained with ground truth information . More than that , the inpainter has access to additional information about pixel displacement through optical flow estimation performed by FlowNets [ 10 , 11 ] . This further encourages the model to make use of neighbor image information for the reconstruction . Note that optical flow is not available in our case because of the nature of the noise itself . Alternative frameworks based on GANs could be used such as Pix2Pix ( Vid2Vid for videos ) or variants of CycleGAN ( RecycleGAN for videos ) . These methods have been developed for image or video translation and could be used as well for imputation . However , the former relies on paired supervision and the latter on unpaired supervision , which again are not available in our case . Note that for time-dependent slowly moving masks like Clouds at heavy coverage , there exist numerous areas that will never been seen in the sequence , and our model can still recover the masked area with good spatial and temporal quality . ( b ) Comparison with supervised baselines : We propose in the paper a comparison with two supervised variants of our model . One makes use of paired supervision and the other one of unpaired supervision . This is addressed in Section 3.3 for a description of the model variants and in Section 4.1 ( last paragraph ) for a quantitative comparison . Supervision brings a lot of additional information and considerably improves the model performance .

They are usually used uniquely while testing after training the model with synthetic masks , such as in [ 13 , 14 ] .

Since [ 1 ] specifically looks for rectangular cuboids of video information , it is extremely well adapted for the Moving-Vertical-Bar and thus performs well . However , for more general complex types of noise such as Raindrops , Remove-Pixel , and Cloud noises , it can not work properly . More precisely , it remains blocked in the search for relevant candidate patches for the occluded pixels . This means that no matter how hard it tries , it can not complete the task . The absence of the experiment results for [ 1 ] in tables 1 and 2 is due to this issue and not to insufficient running time . For example , we also tried with very small patches ( 3x3x3 ) , a reasonable minimum size for spatiotemporal patches , the algorithm still remains blocked and is then unable to terminate . This was probably not clear enough in the original manuscript and this will be made explicit in a new version . Minor comments : sure this is SOTA , thanks .
