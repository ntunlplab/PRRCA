In the binary word embedding of each word , we set the dimensions corresponding to the k closest cluster centers to 1 and 0 otherwise . Most parts of the paper are describing how the simple word embedding method is related to the neural system of a fruit fly and showing the method achieves comparable performance compared with GloVe in word similarity tasks , context-sensitive word similarity datasets , and document classification tasks . Pros : 1.It is interesting to see the connection between a biological neural system and word embedding . 2.As far as I know , the method is novel . 3.Such a simple and biologically plausible method could reach reasonable performance . Cons : 1.The experiments have not demonstrated that the method is a useful word embedding method for NLP researchers . Some of the experiment designs , comparisons , and presentations are misleading . 2.Some related work and comparisons are missing . 3.The authors actually do not explain why this method works well in machine learning perspectives ( similar to a biological neural system is not a very strong explanation for many people ) . Clarity : The paper is easy to understand , but it does not explain why the method works from the ML perspective . Originality : As far as I know , the method is novel . Significance of this work : This might have a large impact on the neuroscience field . The method is compared with GloVe most of the time . First , GloVe actually does not perform well in word similarity tasks compared with word2vec/SGNS [ 3 ] . In terms of document classification , the results are mixed and I think the authors should try more datasets to know which method is better . In addition , GloVe is trained on a different dataset , so the result is not very comparable . Second , GloVe is a dense method . The proposed method should be compared with binary word embedding or compressed word embedding methods such as [ 1,2 ] . It will be even better if you can show that it is better than sparse representation such as PPMI in [ 3 ] , even though PPMI is not binary and uses much more dimensions ( you might want to use the dot product values instead of binary value in Equation ( 4 ) to improve your method and make the comparison fairer ) . As I mention at the beginning , I believe the word embedding is actually a binary projection to Kmeans-like cluster centers in the context vector space . Here is why . Let 's first assume W_ { mu } and v^A are normalized and ignore the normalization term /p to build the connection . Then , the l2 distance is ( 1 - dot product ) . Equation ( 1 ) tells us that we are minimizing the l2 distance between v^A and its closest cluster center ( i.e. , W_ { mu } ) . Finally , Equation ( 4 ) clearly describes the top k projection . If I am right , I think adding this perspective will make readers understand the method better . If I am wrong , please explain why and try to explain what the method is actually doing in some machine learning perspectives . If I am right , we will find the description section 3.2 might be misleading . The main reason that the average cosine similarity within the cluster is higher might be because the binarization projection makes the word embeddings locally collapse to small cluster centers , which makes the word embeddings can not capture the fine-grained statistics details . You can visualize the word embedding in a 2D space to see if I am right . If I am right , this is not an advantage in my opinion . If the authors could show that the proposed method is state of the art compared with binary word embeddings in a fair setting ( e.g. , train on the same dataset ) , I will vote acceptance . Otherwise , I am very likely to keep my weak rejection vote . Minor : 1.The definition of p before Equation ( 1 ) is unclear . Why do you have a mod here ? 2.The optimization method in Equation ( 2 ) is unclear . What does dt mean ? Is t the time step in iterative optimization ? Is this a kind of gradient descent ? I guess the differential equation comes from neural science and it needs more explanations to make NLP researchers understand . It would be better if the author can compare with other optimization methods such as gradient descent and EM algorithm for Kmeans clustering .

( In terms of document classification , the authors should try more datasets\u2026 ) We have added two additional datasets : WOS-11967 ( Kowsari et al. , 2017 ) and TREC-6datasets ( Li & Roth , 2002 ) to Table 5 . 4 . ( GloVe is trained on a different dataset ) : We have trained GloVe on OpenWebText ( the corpus that we used for training our algorithm ) . The results are reported in Table 9 in the Supplemental , technical details of training are reported in Appendix E ( section 10 ) . We have constrained the vocabulary to be the same as the vocabulary of our method . The overall wall-clock training time was approximately 10 hours , which is significantly larger than the training time for our method ( see Table 6 ) . 5 . ( Method should be compared with binary word embedding or compressed word embedding ) We did compare with binary word embedding in the initial submission . Table 7 in Appendix B is dedicated to this comparison . In that table , NLB refers to the method of Ref [ 1 ] that you recommended . We have also created a similar table , Table 8 , to compare with common binarization methods of word2vec , and Table 9 with comparisons to GloVe trained on OWT . We have also added Table 2 to the main text with a short summary of these results for hash length k=4 . 6 . ( Word embedding is a binary projection to Kmeans-like cluster centers ) : This is only partly correct . We have added a discussion of the relationship between K-means and our algorithm at the end of section 2.2 . Indeed , for constant $ p_i $ our algorithm is a version of spherical K-means clustering . More precisely it is a biologically plausible implementation of spherical K-means clustering . But this is not the case for generic $ p_i $ , as we explain in the last paragraph of section 2.2 . We hope this answers your question . 7 . ( Description section 3.2 might be misleading\u2026 ) : We have conducted additional experiments by binarizing pretrained GloVe embeddings at varying thresholds as well as comparing with other binarization methods ( Tissier at al . ) and plotted all of them on the diagram in Fig.3 . The conclusion is that the improvement in clustering quality ( compared to continuous GloVe ) is indeed due to binarization . As seen in Fig.3 , panel A , the clusters lose detail ( i.e. , both intra- and inter-cluster similarity increases ) as the binarization threshold gets higher ( shown for Glove ) . Our embeddings maintain a balance between intra- and inter-clustering similarity , and thus still capture fine-grained cluster information . Thanks for the suggestion to do these additional experiments . 8 . ( If the authors could show that the proposed method is SOTA compared with binary word embeddings in a fair setting , e.g. , train on the same dataset , I will vote acceptance ) : We include results for GloVe trained using the same dataset ( OWT ) and the same vocabulary as for our method . Word similarity analysis results are reported in Table 9 of the Supplemental . Please notice that fruit fly embeddings are SOTA for small hash lengths . Specifically , our method outperforms existing alternatives for binarization on MEN and WS353 ( for $ k=4,8,16 $ ) , SIMPLEX ( for $ k=4 $ ) , RG ( for $ k=16 $ ) , and Mturk ( for $ k=4,8 $ ) . Small hash lengths are particularly valuable for compression , since the memory footprint grows with the hash length ( it is sufficient to store only the indices of the entries that are assigned state 1 ) . 9 . ( The definition of p before Eq ( 1 ) is unclear . Why do you have a mod here ? ) : Please see footnote 1 that we added to the revised paper to explain this . 10 . ( The optimization method in Eq ( 2 ) is unclear . What does dt mean ? ... ) : We have changed the notations in Eq 2 to be more consistent with machine learning literature . Regarding alternative ways of doing optimization , the right hand side of Eq ( 2 ) does not coincide with the gradient of the energy function ( 1 ) . However , as explained in ( Ryali et al. , 2020 ) , updating the weights using Eq ( 2 ) always leads to decreasing the energy . We have done an extensive set of experiments on simple datasets ( MNIST ) to check that the two optimization procedures - naive gradient descent on energy ( 1 ) vs. equation ( 2 ) - obtain equally good solutions with approximately the same final value of energy . The advantage of using Eq ( 2 ) compared to the naive gradient descent is that it satisfies the constraints of biological plausibility , which is important for our approach since we are modelling a biological network ."}, {"review_id": "xfmSoxdxFCG-2", "review_text": "Summary : The authors present a formalization of a simple biological network ( the mushroom body of the fruit fly ) , that allows very efficient \u201c biologically inspired \u201d word embeddings . They train this network to generate both static ( context-independent ) and context dependent embeddings , and evaluate these embeddings using several metrics comparing mainly to GloVe embeddings , and to some extent to BERT embeddings . Although the results are sometimes inferior , they are overall comparable , and importantly achieved at significantly lower computational resources . The main contribution of this work is not this specific network formalization ( which is nice ) , but rather demonstrating that formalizing biological networks can generate more efficient algorithms , that achieve results comparable to the complex algorithms used ubiquitously . Strengths : + The approach of the paper , namely generating word embeddings using a formalization of a well-known biological network , is interesting and inspiring + The authors evaluate the embeddings using both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation methods , which is important + The learned embeddings are surprisingly strong , given the small and computationally efficient network . Furthermore , the embeddings seem to separate concepts well . These results support the idea that correlations between words and contexts , can indeed be extracted from raw text ( in an unsupervised manner ) by this network . I find this important because although the biological network of the fruit fly clearly did not evolve to perform NLP tasks , the fact that it evolved to process input from several modalities seems to allow it to learn efficient embeddings . Weaknesses : - I would have liked to see comparison of the resulting embeddings to more than GloVe . E.g.see https : //arxiv.org/pdf/1901.09785.pdf , who discuss intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations of embeddings and compare to many embeddings . For example , GloVe is actually not the best for word similarity . - For the extrinsic tasks describes in the document classification section , I would have liked to see a comparison to BERT as well , not just GloVe ( or even other embeddings ) . I think these tasks can indeed use context . - I think it would also be useful to evaluate on more extrinsic tasks , although given the space constraints I understand this may be difficult . - Finally , it would have been good to see more analysis of the embeddings , e.g.by doing error analysis in one or more of the evaluation methods . Recommendation : I vote for accepting this paper . I very much like the approach of looking at biological networks and trying to learn from them how one can efficiently perform computations . I would have liked to see a more in-depth comparison and analysis in some places , but the results as-is are promising , interesting and inspiring enough to be of interest to the ICLR community . Questions and minor comments : 1 . In Figure 2 , the legend reads to me as if the context words are in light blue , but in the figure both target word and context words are in light blue . 2.I think it would be helpful to make a comment that context in this paper is essentially Bag Of Words , as there is no positional information . 3.In the semantic similarity section , the authors refer to the supplement for binarized GloVe embedding results . I looked at the supplemental results and I found them compelling . I recommend at least saying the conclusion in the main paper ( that your binary word embeddings are competitive with binarized GloVe embeddings ) , rather than just sending the reader to the supplement .", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "reply_text": "Thanks for your enthusiastic feedback and nice comments !

Specifically , our method outperforms existing alternatives for binarization on MEN and WS353 ( for $ k=4,8,16 $ ) , SIMPLEX ( for $ k=4 $ ) , RG ( for $ k=16 $ ) , and Mturk ( for $ k=4,8 $ ) . Small hash lengths are particularly valuable for compression , since the memory footprint grows with the hash length ( it is sufficient to store only the indices of the entries that are assigned state 1 ) . 9 . ( The definition of p before Eq ( 1 ) is unclear . Why do you have a mod here ? ) : Please see footnote 1 that we added to the revised paper to explain this . 10 . ( The optimization method in Eq ( 2 ) is unclear . What does dt mean ? ... ) : We have changed the notations in Eq 2 to be more consistent with machine learning literature . Regarding alternative ways of doing optimization , the right hand side of Eq ( 2 ) does not coincide with the gradient of the energy function ( 1 ) . However , as explained in ( Ryali et al. , 2020 ) , updating the weights using Eq ( 2 ) always leads to decreasing the energy . We have done an extensive set of experiments on simple datasets ( MNIST ) to check that the two optimization procedures - naive gradient descent on energy ( 1 ) vs. equation ( 2 ) - obtain equally good solutions with approximately the same final value of energy . The advantage of using Eq ( 2 ) compared to the naive gradient descent is that it satisfies the constraints of biological plausibility , which is important for our approach since we are modelling a biological network ."}, "2": {"review_id": "xfmSoxdxFCG-2", "review_text": "Summary : The authors present a formalization of a simple biological network ( the mushroom body of the fruit fly ) , that allows very efficient \u201c biologically inspired \u201d word embeddings . They train this network to generate both static ( context-independent ) and context dependent embeddings , and evaluate these embeddings using several metrics comparing mainly to GloVe embeddings , and to some extent to BERT embeddings . Although the results are sometimes inferior , they are overall comparable , and importantly achieved at significantly lower computational resources . The main contribution of this work is not this specific network formalization ( which is nice ) , but rather demonstrating that formalizing biological networks can generate more efficient algorithms , that achieve results comparable to the complex algorithms used ubiquitously . Strengths : + The approach of the paper , namely generating word embeddings using a formalization of a well-known biological network , is interesting and inspiring + The authors evaluate the embeddings using both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation methods , which is important + The learned embeddings are surprisingly strong , given the small and computationally efficient network . Furthermore , the embeddings seem to separate concepts well . These results support the idea that correlations between words and contexts , can indeed be extracted from raw text ( in an unsupervised manner ) by this network . I find this important because although the biological network of the fruit fly clearly did not evolve to perform NLP tasks , the fact that it evolved to process input from several modalities seems to allow it to learn efficient embeddings . Weaknesses : - I would have liked to see comparison of the resulting embeddings to more than GloVe . E.g.see https : //arxiv.org/pdf/1901.09785.pdf , who discuss intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations of embeddings and compare to many embeddings . For example , GloVe is actually not the best for word similarity . - For the extrinsic tasks describes in the document classification section , I would have liked to see a comparison to BERT as well , not just GloVe ( or even other embeddings ) . I think these tasks can indeed use context . - I think it would also be useful to evaluate on more extrinsic tasks , although given the space constraints I understand this may be difficult . - Finally , it would have been good to see more analysis of the embeddings , e.g.by doing error analysis in one or more of the evaluation methods . Recommendation : I vote for accepting this paper . I very much like the approach of looking at biological networks and trying to learn from them how one can efficiently perform computations . I would have liked to see a more in-depth comparison and analysis in some places , but the results as-is are promising , interesting and inspiring enough to be of interest to the ICLR community . Questions and minor comments : 1 . In Figure 2 , the legend reads to me as if the context words are in light blue , but in the figure both target word and context words are in light blue . 2.I think it would be helpful to make a comment that context in this paper is essentially Bag Of Words , as there is no positional information . 3.In the semantic similarity section , the authors refer to the supplement for binarized GloVe embedding results . I looked at the supplemental results and I found them compelling . I recommend at least saying the conclusion in the main paper ( that your binary word embeddings are competitive with binarized GloVe embeddings ) , rather than just sending the reader to the supplement .", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "reply_text": "Thanks for your enthusiastic feedback and nice comments ! We address the questions/comments below : 1 . ( I would have liked to see comparison of the resulting embeddings to more than GloVe ) : We have also added comparison with word2vec embeddings , please see column 4 of Table 1 and Table 8 in the Supplemental . Please see also added comparisons with word2vec in Tables 3,4,5 . And also an added comparison with Word2Sense in Tables 3,4 ( per request of Rev 3 ) . 2 . ( For the extrinsic tasks describes in the document classification section , I would have liked to see a comparison to BERT as well , not just GloVe , or even other embeddings ) : We have updated Table 5 with the results for word2vec , BERT , and NLB embeddings ( Tissier et al. , 2019 ) . 3 . ( I think it would also be useful to evaluate on more extrinsic tasks ) : We have added two additional datasets for document classification to Table 5 . They are WOS-11967 ( Kowsari et al. , 2017 ) and TREC-6datasets ( Li & Roth , 2002 ) . Although they are the same tasks - document classification , these additional results extend our analysis on extrinsic evaluations by adding more datasets . Furthemore , for a fair comparison , we evaluate all methods on the same vocabulary ( 20k words ) , which removes variability of the results due to the ( arbitrary ) choice of the vocabulary . This explains the slightly updated numbers in Table 5 . 4 . ( It would have been good to see more analysis of the embeddings , e.g.by doing error analysis in one or more of the evaluation methods ) : We have created an online tool , which we are planning to release with the paper , that allows users to explore the representations learned by our model for various inputs ( context-target pairs ) . For a given query the tool returns the word cloud visualization for each of the four top activated Kenyon cells . We have added Appendix D ( section 9 ) to the Supplemental where we included some of those examples , please see Fig.6.As you can see , the model indeed nicely captures contextual meaning and polysemy . 5 . ( In Figure 2 , the legend reads to me as ... ) : Fixed ! 6 . ( I think it would be helpful to make a comment that context in this paper ... ) : Comment added in text referencing Fig.2.7 . ( In the semantic similarity section , the authors refer to the supplement for binarized GloVe ... ) : Conclusion added for pretrained GloVe and also for word2vec and GloVe trained on OWT ( Tables 7,8,9 ) . We have also added Table 2 and explanation to the main text in sec 3.1 to briefly summarize those results ."}}
