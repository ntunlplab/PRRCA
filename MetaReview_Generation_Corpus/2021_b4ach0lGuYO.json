In the rebuttal, the authors added additional experiments as requested, but R1 and R2 were not convinced by the new results. In particular, R1 pointed out that even the unsupervised setup in [4] achieved 0.89 AUC, outperforming 0.86 as reported in the paper.

Applying different masks to 4 copies of images and then merge ? * * - Yes , we merge 4 copies of images . these black boxes in 4 checkboard masks are not overlapped , we just combine reconstructed regions . > Stopping rule of iteration - We added stopping rule shortly in revised version . Since our iteration method do n't train any parameters , they easily stops when there is no difference on mask ( t-1 ) and mask ( t ) . Best ,"}, "3": {"review_id": "b4ach0lGuYO-3", "review_text": "This approach relies on learning merely normal training sample and then distinguishing between normal and abnormal events regarding the threshold of the reconstruction error . I3AD exploits a combination of per-pixel identity function and conditional auto-encoder which is capable of encoding only normal regions and decoding just anomalous regions . Weaknesses : -Although this paper has attempted to propose an efficient algorithm for anomaly detection , the the general idea of this paper is not sufficiently innovative . -The most important works on the topics are not cited . -The proposed method is not comprehensively compared with the other solution . -A comprehensive analysis of the complexity of the proposed method is required . It seems the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performed at the expense of complexity . Strengths : This paper is well written so that the structure is easy to follow . The majority of the obtained results are better than the state-of-the-art has been reported in this paper . The proposed method has tried to tackle two noticeable issues of using auto-encoders for the task of anomaly detection including their defect inappropriately modeling small detail as well as the existing object mismatching that the models are trained to minimize total reconstruction errors", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Thank you for your time assessing our paper .
