The loss is a balance between a reconstruction error and a negative inpainting error (high error means object is probably present, due to the weak correlation with the background). My decision is Weak Accept. I like the method very much and think it\u2019s a clever and well-executed algorithm. The reason for being Weak is because the experimental evidence could be stronger, especially comparing with Croitoru et al. and Rhodin et al. The paper leaves some open problems, inviting future work to be built on top of it (i.e. leveraging time more and handling multiple objects better). I think it should be accepted to promote such future work. Method: The method is interesting and clever. Similar efforts have been made, such as Bielski & Favaro and Crawford & Pineau. However, key contributions relax some of the contrived requirements of these past methods (e.g. simple foreground translation over background; requirement of plain background). Thanks to the inpainter, the importance sampler, and avoidance of collapsing into trivial solutions, this paper is able to put together a method that works on moving cameras and fairly complex scene semantics (still limited to one object though). Actually getting this to converge with only two loss terms balanced against each other is impressive. Having certain heads of the network trained only on one of the two terms seems to be a key contribution. Experimental results: The comparison with Rhodin et al. on H36M is characterized as \u201cslightly\u201d lower, but I would call 71% vs. 58% a significant difference. Of course, I understand that Rhodin et al. relies on the static background, so this is not a fair comparison. Ski-PTZ-Dataset should then offer a better comparison, but here the method struggles to compete with Croitoru et al. 2019, which has a 11-point higher F-measure. On Handheld190k, the dataset proposed in this paper, is where the method finally shines, but still only offers a 1-point F-measure improvement over Croitoru et al. That being said, considering how different the methods are, and how Croitoru et al. requires two-stage training, there are many benefits to this method. Croitoru et al. also relies on video to extract the object features, and this requirement is not as explicit in this work. Actually, that brings me to one question I had. The paper states that \u201cas long as videos or picture collections of a single object in front of the same scene are available.\u201d I didn\u2019t quite understand why this must be trained on multiple images of the same scene.

It is also not that meaningful to point out that your method\u2019s precision is higher than that of Croitoru et al., when the F-measure is shy 11 points. The reason is because many points on the precision/recall could be constructed simply by applying for instance a gamma curve on the segmentation predictions.
