[ 1.The authors propose to use so-called noise contrastive prior , but the actual implementation boils down to adding Gaussian noise to input points and respective outputs . ] We would like to clarify . NCP adds a term to the objective to match the epistemic variance that the model predicts for perturbed inputs to a prior value . The normal training objective using unmodified training inputs and labels is still present . While this can loosely be described as predicting noisy outputs for noisy inputs , there are technical differences . Mainly , NCP only targets the epistemic and not the aleatoric variance , thus encouraging uncertain and not necessarily noisy predictions . This encourages the model to separate epistemic and aleatoric variances , as needed to compute the information gain . Moreover , the KL term that NCP adds to the objective is computed in closed form , so there is no noise added to the outputs . [ This seems to be the simplest possible prior in data space ( well known for example in Bayesian linear regression ) . ] While NCP is a natural idea , there certainly exist simpler data priors . For example , one could define a prior on the full predictive distribution , rather than targeting only the mean and epistemic variance . Moreover , one could use a data-independent prior ( \\mu_y=0 ) that might improve uncertainty but degrade generalization . We explicitly avoid more complex priors that are difficult to optimize , such as OOD GANs ( Lee et al. , 2017 ) .

In addition to defining the NCP prior , our paper contributes a practical algorithm for applying data priors to models that are optimized via variational inference . While parameter inference for linear regression has a closed form , this is not the case for BNNs . A key observation of our paper is that applying a data prior on training inputs is not enough in this case -- it must be applied beyond the training distribution if it should be enforced for unseen inputs . Our paper shows that this clearly improves the usefulness of uncertainty estimates for active learning .

We decided for active learning experiments to go beyond the mainly qualitative analysis often conducted for new OOD methods . Active learning using the expected information gain is specifically appropriate in our case , as the noise and uncertainty predictions take opposing roles in this acquisition function .

The authors propose noise contrastive priors \u2014 the idea being to explicitly encourage high uncertainties for out of distribution (OOD) data through a loss in the data space. OOD data is simulated by adding noise to existing data and the model is trained to maximize the likelihood wr.t. training data while being close in the KL sense to a (wide) conditional prior p(y | x) on the OOD responses (y). The authors demonstrate that the procedure leads to improved uncertainty estimates on toy data and can better drive active learning on a large flight delay dataset.

My main concern about this work stems from not knowing how sensitive the recovered uncertainties are to the OOD data generating mechanism and the parameters thereof.

Detailed Comments: a) I like the sensitivity analysis presented in Figure 4, and it does show for the 1D sine wave the method is reasonably robust to the choice of \\sigma_x. However, it is unclear how problem dependent the choice of sigma_x is. From the experiments, it seems that \\sigma_x needs to be carefully chosen for different problems, \\sigma^2_x < 0.3 seems to not work very well for BBB + NCP for the 1D sine data, but for the flight delay data \\sigma^2_x is set to 0.1 and seems to work well. How was \\sigma_x chosen for the different experiments? b) It is also interesting that noise with a shared scale is used for all 8 dimensions of the flight dataset. Is this choice mainly governed by convenience \u2014 easier to select one hyper-parameter rather than eight? c) Presumably, the predictive uncertainties are also strongly affected by both the weighting parameter \\gamma and the prior variance sigma^2_y .
