The paper received 3 reviews. R1 recommends Weak Reject based on concerns about the contributions of the paper; the authors, in their response, indicate that R1 may have been confused about what the contributions were meant to be. R2 initially recommended Reject, based on concerns that the paper was overselling its claims, and on the clarity and quality of writing. After the author response, R2 raised their score to Weak Reject but still felt that their main concerns had gone unanswered, and in particular that the authors seemed unwilling to tone down their claims. R3 recommends Weak Reject, indicating that they found the paper difficult to follow and gave some specific technical concerns. The authors, in their response, express confusion about R3's comments and suggest that R3 also did not understand the paper. However, in light of these unanimous Weak Reject reviews, we cannot recommend acceptance at this time.  We understand that the authors may feel that some reviewers did not properly understand or appreciate the contribution, but all three reviewers are researchers working at highly-ranked institutions and thus are fairly representative of the attendees of ICLR; we hope that their points of confusion and concern, as reflected in their reviews, will help authors to clarify a revision of the paper for another venue. \n\n", "reviews": [{"review_id": "r1e30AEKPr-0", "review_text": "I would like to thank the authors for the detailed rebuttal. My concern is generalizing something that is not correctly describing the object we should model (KGs).

The authors misunderstood my comment about (Bloem-Reddy and Teh 2019). \"Therefore the previous works mentioned by the reviewer above are irrelevant.\" => this is a weird statement. Permutation invariance is relevant to all objects that are graphs. I recommend reading the long history relating graph models and exchangeability (Persi Diaconis has a good overview). I was just mentioning that I don't see why KGs should have another associated permutation group besides permutation invariance. I would also recommend following the emerging literature in graph representation learning using group theory, of which KGs are but a special case. \"The (entity) manifold, however, means that the relations no longer form a group.

I will raise my score because the paper could be published as a niche paper. We generalize KGE but we acknowledge its shortcomings: And here is a way to measure the embedding error of modeling the relations as a group, when they are not actually a group. -------------- The paper is well written and an interesting read. I think it complements well the existing literature. Unfortunately, I think the paper overstate its claims. It is clear that permutation groups are the natural language of all graphs (Kondor and Trivedi, 2018) and (Bloem-Reddy and Teh, 2019). It is less clear that knowledge graphs also comply with another set of group axioms. Why would the set of relations be closed? Say, Owns \\cdot Spouse_of = ? .

I understand why this is true for KGE but this is not true for KGs, which only shows that KGEs may not be the right method to represent KGs moving forward. I see no easy fix. The rest of the paper is straightforward, just applying the definitions of groups. I found the classification of different methods interesting, and should be made more clear in the experiments. The experimental results are interesting but their significance is unclear. Please add standard deviations to all experiments. We cannot have a sense of the significance of the results without knowing how many runs were executed, how they were executed (e.g., k-fold cross-validation, bootstrapping), and their standard deviation. I dispute that the paper proves that the definition of groups emerges purely from the nature of the knowledge graph embedding (KGE) task. I would actually say the opposite, it is clear to me that for most KGs, their relations do not fit the definition of a group. I am open to be (formally) proven wrong. E.g., can you list all relations in FB15K and show that they fit the group axioms? Fixing the paper: Maybe the paper could be rewritten, constrained to Euclidean spaces? Then prove (formally) that the group axioms are a sufficient(?) and necessary(?) condition for such embeddings?

Reviewer : \u201c Why would the set of relations be closed ? Say , Owns \\cdot Spouse_of = ? I can not see why and how this is necessary . Must all embedding methods be closed ? I dispute that the paper proves that the definition of groups emerges purely from the nature of the knowledge graph embedding ( KGE ) task .

E.g. , can you list all relations in FB15K and show that they fit the group axioms ? \u201d Response : This concern is related to an important difference between the following two things : the relation pattern in a specific KG and the structure of the relation embedding space . We have discussed this in a very careful way in Sec.3.2 of our manuscript . To put it in short : all properties mentioned in the paper , including closure , identity , inversion , and associativity , are desired properties of relation embedding spaces , rather than existing properties of specific knowledge graphs . In our paper , we choose the proper words very carefully to address this difference . For the closure property , we phrased as : \u201c To allow the possible existence of composition , in general , the elements R1 \u00b7 R2 should also be an element living in the same relation-embedding space \u201d , which clearly suggests that it is a requirement for the * relation-embedding space * to accommodate * possible existence of composition * in specific KG datasets . Besides , we also explained explicitly , in the footnote on page.3 , that \u201c Given a graph , not all compositions correspond to meaningful relations , but an embedding model should be able to capture this possibility in general \u201d . ================================ Below we give a more detailed discussion : a . The relation patterns in a specific KG : We completely agree that for a specific KG , the meaningful relations existing in the graph may not form an exact group . However , it is clear that some relation patterns indeed can emerge from compositions and inversions in real KGs , which is the exact concern taken by a lot of proceeding studies , including RotatE , QuatE , and DihEdral . The problem is that , in a specific KG , these patterns , which we denote as super-relations , are not accessible to users/researchers , since it is not practical at all to enumerate every single pattern in a large KG . b.The structure of the relation embedding space : When proposing a model for general KGE tasks , due to the difficulty of directly access all super-relations in every single task , one should try to accommodate all possibilities . Take the \u2018 closure \u2019 as an example , in a specific KG dataset , one might not know if certain compositional relations are existing . Note that there are two types of \u2018 compositions \u2019 : conceptual and mathematical ones . The conceptual one depends on the specific dataset ; the mathematical one depends on the embedding method . To accommodate the possible existence of the conceptual composition r1\u00b7 r2 , whatever representations , say R1 and R2 , are assigned to r1 and r2 , the mathematical composition R1\u00b7 R2 must also be contained in the relation embedding space . For instance , in RotatE , where each relation is a U ( 1 ) rotation , the composition of two U ( 1 ) elements are still contained in the U ( 1 ) group . Prove the requirement of closure by contradiction : Suppose abstract relation r1 , r2 are embedded as R1 , R2 . Importantly , since the operation rule of a relation-embedding R and an entity-embedding E are already fixed , the mathematical composition rule between R1 and R2 has also been fixed : it is defined as operating by R1 first then by R2 subsequently . If the closure is absent ( i.e.R1\u00b7 R2 is not contained in the embedding space ) , this method would never be able to correctly represent the r1\u00b7 r2 . Therefore , the model would fail the KGE tasks where r1\u00b7 r2 exists . ================================"}, {"review_id": "r1e30AEKPr-1", "review_text": "This paper start merely by studying the graph reconstruction problem and prove that the intrinsic structure of this task itself automatically produces the complete definition of groups. it seems to be a novel result.

In other words , the theoretical analysis is trying to show the emergence of the mathematical object , group , from the requirements of a general KGE problem . It should not matter too much whether or not the analysis is formulated into a theorem . If one insists , though , the main finding mentioned above can be formulated as the following theorem : \u201c Theorem : to accommodate the most general knowledge graph structures , the relation embedding space would form a group parameter space ( or group manifold ) . \u201d The proof in the appendix is provided to show that relations in a knowledge graph , which are naturally defined as mappings from one entity to another , obey the \u2018 associativity \u2019 property .

Although the mathematics of the proof in the appendix seems trivial , it is important and significant because it can hold if and only if a proper definition of composition law is rigorously provided .

For the first question , our analysis in Sec.3 finds the requirements that coincide with the definition of groups ( this is the first work that formally proved this as we know ) ; therefore , for the second one , group manifolds are natural choice for relational embedding model ; for the third one , we have provided a general recipe to automatically construct a model as long as the embedding group is chosen . In this sense , our work targets at the most general KGE tasks , rather than on a specific one . The reviewer \u2019 s concern about \u201c which group to embed \u201d is asking a detailed version of the second question . General KGE problems only restrict the embedding space from arbitrary spaces into group manifolds , while \u201c which group is proper \u201d depends on the details of specific tasks . Besides , with the most general concerns , we explained that the choice of groups could be further narrowed into the category of * continuous * * non-abelian * groups . Continuous groups are more efficient for gradient-based tasks , and the non-abelian nature could handle relation compositions which are not commutative , both of which concern general KGE problems . While these are all the restrictions one could derive for generic tasks , in practice , if more details of the given task are available , one could further restrict the choice of groups into a smaller category of groups . For example , if one knows in advance that all ( or most ) relation compositions are commutative in a specific task , then a larger non-abelian group would be redundant , and one could simply use an abelian sub-group , which is much smaller and computationally efficient ."}, {"review_id": "r1e30AEKPr-2", "review_text": "The authors approach the problem of representing knowledge graphs from a top-down perspective, in which they argue for certain fundamental desiderata for hyper-relations (composition, inversion) followed by properties that define a mathematical group.

It's not clear to me what motivates selecting a (abelian) group, where inversion, closure, identity, associativity, and commutativity are demanded to be properties of knowledge graph embedding models. This seems more a definition of what models they consider, rather than a novel insight about knowledge graph embedding models itself (the authors claim \"we proved for the first time the emergence of a group definition in the KG representation learning\", which seems hard to wrap one head's around). Given this overarching family of models, the authors proceed to identify existing models as certain choices of that family. I see little use in inventing this abstraction as the authors do not show any practical insights, or interesting theoretical analysis that comes from this higher-level abstraction.", "rating": "3: Weak Reject", "reply_text": "We thank the reviewer for the review and would like to address the following points : 1 . Reviewer : \u201c It 's not clear to me what motivates selecting a ( abelian ) group , where inversion , closure , identity , associativity , and commutativity are demanded to be properties of knowledge graph embedding models . This seems more a definition of what models they consider , rather than a novel insight about knowledge graph embedding models itself ( the authors claim `` we proved for the first time the emergence of a group definition in the KG representation learning '' , which seems hard to wrap one head 's around ) . \u201d Response : It seems that the reviewer failed to grasp the delivery in our paper , we did not recommend the Abelian group at all \u2014 instead , with all the analysis on a general KGE task in Sec.3 of the paper , we suggest * non-Abelian * groups for relation embeddings . It is not clear what the reviewers mean by \u201c a definition of what models they consider \u201d since what Eq.1 describes is a general knowledge graph , not a model at all . And , importantly , the four properties : closure , identity , inverse , and associativity ( along with non-commutativity ) , are the most general requirements of KGE tasks themselves , not restricted to any specific model structures . 2.Reviewer : \u201c Given this overarching family of models , the authors proceed to identify existing models as certain choices of that family . I see little use in inventing this abstraction as the authors do not show any practical insights or interesting theoretical analysis that comes from this higher-level abstraction. \u201d Response : We do not understand what \u201c family \u201d the reviewer is referring to . We would like to emphasize again : the properties in Sec.3.2 , which happen to coincide with the mathematical definition of groups , are requirements of general KGE tasks , not restricted to any specific modeling structures . We offer a deep understanding of these requirements , following which , a natural choice for general KGE model would be using non-Abelian continuous groups . Our recipe in Sec.4 describes in detail how to construct the embedding model when a group is selected , which directly produces models for * practical usage * . Our experimental instantiation selected SU ( 2 ) as the embedding group and constructed the corresponding embedding model that can be used in practice , which finished a complete demonstration of the proposed framework . Without this understanding , there is no general recipe to systematically construct KGE models at all ."}}
