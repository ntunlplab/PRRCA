Their main contribution is enabling inference on integer-only hardware by covering all parameters of all operators in convolutional networks, including weight, bias, activation and scaling factor. To address the quantization noise issue in bias parameters, they adopt Straight-Through Estimator and fine-tune the parameters after quantization. To improve inference efficiency, they apply BN layer fusion. They conduct experiments on public datasets for image classification and object detection to conclude that LLSQ achieves lower accuracy degradation compared to previous work. Finally, they test the quantized model on a specialized integer accelerator, showing the feasibility of the quantization on real hardware. In conclusion, this paper generalizes linear symmetric quantization to all parameters in order to deploy the network on specialized integer neural network processors for efficient inference. In terms of algorithmic contribution, this paper introduces the scaling factor as a learnable parameter of the quantizer, but lacks enough theoretical justification. Therefore, I would consider weakly accepting the paper. For the algorithm, the following should be addressed. 1. In scaling factor updating policy, the simulated gradient performs better compared to EMA. However, the motivation for choosing this policy is unclear, and there is no mathematical derivation of the gradient value. 2. In this study, pretrained network weights in full precision are used, thus the quantization procedure should take fixed weights as inputs. However, in section 3.3, the quantization scaling factor is updated in the training phase of the network, with weights being updated at the same time This seems to be a contradiction, and the experiment results where quantizer is trained with network weights fixed should also be presented. For the experiment, the following should be addressed. 1. The training time for different bit-width settings should be included in the results. 2. The reason for leaving the first and last layers in full precision is unclear, and doing so may go against the objective of deploying the quantized model on specialized integer hardware according to the paper.

This paper proposes a learned linear symmetric quantizer to reduce the precision of weight, bias, and activation. The proposed approach works as the following: for a pre-trained neural network, it computes the new weight and activation as a product of a quantized value with a scaling factor. The quantization is based on a simple linear, symmetric function as in equation (1). The value of the scaling factor is searched by \"simulated gradient\" or exponential moving average during re-training. Next, batch normalization is fused into convolution, and the scaling factor and biases are re-calculated. Last, the scaling factor on the convolution is merged with bias terms, to remove the need for multiplication in hardware implementation. Since bias terms usually have a much larger dynamic range, higher precision is used to represent biases.
