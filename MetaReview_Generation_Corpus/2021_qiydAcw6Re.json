This paper studies algebraic geometry (an area unfamiliar to most ICLR readers) of program synthesis, with the \"hope that algebraic geometry can assist in developing the next generation of synthesis machines.\" Unfortunately, this paper does not get far enough down that path, and its implications cannot realistically be appreciated by an ICLR audience. The reviewers indicate that their low confidence is due to their lack of understanding of algebraic geometry and not due to their lack of understanding of program synthesis. The featured implication of the paper is that synthesized programs are singularities of analytic functions, which is not very meaningful to the ICLR audience. Even if external reviewers verified the correctness of the math, the ICLR audience would still not understand the implications.

The main claim of the paper is that when doing relaxations and attempt to view satisfying programs as the variety W0 of some mathematical function , W0 is typically larger than W0 \\intersect Wcode . This is important because one may easily find a point of solution in the variety W0 , yet it can not be realized as a working program in Wcode .

It is nice to see why this happened in a formal setting . As I am confident that my expertise in this area is not high , I will not be providing an explicit pro/con list . I would instead ask a few questions to the authors and hope I can get a good response : - A natural thing to make program synthesis more amendable is by changing the set Wcode . For instance , if I were to represent the function that adds 3 , I can either do that with x + 3 , or with x+1+1+1 . Now , which one of these representation would lead to a Wcode that has a better chance of intersecting better with W0 ? As DSL designers , we have fairly big freedom in designing what Wcode is , that is often the only thing we can control . Is there a rule of thumb that we can follow to ensure that gradient-based or sampling-based relaxation works well ? i.e.W0 is n't such a horrible extended object ? - Another `` knob '' that we can control easily in synthesis is the number of input output examples , and which examples to give . If I want to specify a polynomial of degree 2 , I can choose either 3 points , or 30 points . Which is easier ? Specifically , given a specific Wcode , given two dataset of input-output examples , D1 and D2 . Let Sol ( D , Wcode ) denote the set of programs in Wcode that satisfies D completely , in a classical sense . The question is , if Sol ( D1 , Wcode ) = Sol ( D2 , Wcode ) , how do we quantify if synthesis is easier over D1 or over D2 ? i.e.which set , Variety ( D1 ) or Variety ( D2 ) is the more horrible extended object of Wcode ? final recommendation : I maintain my score .
