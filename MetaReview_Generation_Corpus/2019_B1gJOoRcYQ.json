Given the observations, the proposed method uses a convLSTM to produce the key and value tensor. Different from multi-head attention, the query vector is generated in a top-down fashion. The authors proposed to augment the spatial feature with Fourier bases which is similar to previous work. The authors verify the proposed method on both reinforcement learning and supervised learning. On reinforcement learning, the proposed method outperformed the feedforward baseline and LSTM baseline. On reinforcement learning task, the proposed method achieves compelling result with more interpretable attention map that shows the model's decision. [Strength] 1: The proposed model is a straightforward extension of the multi-head attention to visual input. Compare to multi-head attention, it generates the query vector in a top-down manner instead of pure bottom up, and the authors verify the proposed choice is better than LSTM baseline empirically. 2: The authors verify the proposed method by extensive experiments on reinforcement learning tasks and also try supervised learning tasks. The attention visualization and human normalized scores for experts on ATARI show the effectiveness of the proposed method. [Weakness] 1: The soft spatial top-down attention is very common in vision and language domain, such as VQA. As the authors mentioned, the proposed method is very similar with MAC for CLEVER. The sequential attention is also explored in previous VQA work. Thus the novelty of the proposed method is limited. 2: Multi-head attention for NLP tasks are usually composed with multiple layers. Will more layer of attention help the performance? The paper is less of this ablation study. 3: The proposed method is worse compared with other baselines on supervised learning tasks, on both imagenet classification and kinetics. I wonder whether the recurrent process is required for those tasks? On table 2, we can observe that with sequence length 8, the performance is much worse, this may be caused by overfitting. 4: If the recurrent attention is more interpretable, given other visualization methods, such as gradcam, I wonder what is advantage? 5: I would expect that the performance on Kinetics dataset is better since sequential attention is required on video dataset. However, the performance is much worse compare of the baseline in the dataset. I wonder what is the reason? is there ablation study or any other results on this dataset?

We address the concerns you raised below . 1 : While many works have been published with a similar theme ( many of them we mention and cite in the paper ) , this specific configuration is novel , as well as the application to RL . Regarding the differences with MAC ( which is indeed close to our own architecture ) we replied this to reviewer 2 as well : In terms of differences , first we would say that the existence of the question as guidance to the controller in MAC is a fundamental difference mainly because it serves as a very strong top-down bias for the vision ( read ) module - it \u2019 s not just in the initialization of the reasoning , but throughout the whole process . In the RL case you could think of the reward as having a somewhat related role , but we feel this is a big difference . Second , our model is trained end-to-end so the vision can adapt and produce keys/values which are task relevant - MAC uses a pre-trained ImageNet module ( though we don \u2019 t argue MAC can \u2019 t be learned end-to-end , it \u2019 s just that it wasn \u2019 t , and in the RL case , it \u2019 s not clear what pre-trained network would be useful ) . Lastly , MAC does not use a spatial basis of any sort , so it can \u2019 t reason about absolute positioning as well as limited relative positioning ( trip wires , for example , wouldn \u2019 t be possible without this ) . 2 : With NLP it is common to have the output of the attention model to be the same size as the input ( because of the self-attention , all-to-all connectivity ) . This is not the case in this model since we have a severe spatial bottleneck from image size to single vector size . It \u2019 s not clear how to build a multilayer attention model like this , but this is certainly an interesting research direction . 3 : We believe the issue here is not overfitting but rather optimization difficulties . It stems from running a high-capacity convnet over many time steps and propagating gradients . A new model trained with sequence length 8 achieves Top-1 70.1 % , Top-5 88.6 % . We have recently found a curriculum helps as well ; a model that is first trained with sequence length 4 for 2e5 iterations and then further trained with sequence length 8 achieves Top-1 71.7 % , Top-5 89.8 % on sequence length 8 . EDIT : We have a quick update regarding 3 . A new model , also trained with a curriculum where we switch from sequence length 4 to 8 at 1e5 iterations , achieves Top-1 74.5 % , Top-5 91.5 % . This is now better than our sequence length 4 model and also our baseline . 4 : We have found that our method provides a more focused indication of the salient areas in the image for the agent . In section 4.1.6 , we compare with a saliency mapping method that blurs specific regions of the input and measures the change of the policy or value function . Compared to this , our method produces sharper attention maps and more naturally matches the structure of the image ( the alternate analysis can only produce roughly circular regions of interest ) . We have investigated the applications of GradCAM to our baseline model on ATARI . This produces interesting visualizations and is more adapted to the structure of the problem than the saliency visualization . The biggest advantage our model has over GradCAM is it shows all the information that the agent is extracting from the image , not just what is relevant to produce a certain action . GradCAM is a very powerful tool for showing why a certain action is being taken , but it does not show the full information the agent is extracting from the environment . Especially when there is an LSTM above the convolutional stack , information may be extracted at the current timestep that won \u2019 t be used until several timesteps in the future , and so would not show up in a GradCAM visualization of the current frame . One could imagine a modification of the GradCAM architecture which analyzes the gradient of the conv layer with respect to some future action , but this may quickly begin to overwhelm our ability to interpret the images . Using our method , the agent can not extract any information from the current frame that is not attended to , so we are sure we have a full picture of what is relevant for either the current action or any future action . 5 : We didn \u2019 t focus too much on metrics for kinetics ; we were more interested in understanding the attention maps qualitatively . The model has optimization issues on long time sequences , as seen in Imagenet sequence size 8 ."}, {"review_id": "B1gJOoRcYQ-1", "review_text": "Summary.

We also see noticeable dropoff in performance in several levels beyond 8 heads . Beyond that the answer is strongly level-dependent . For example , an agent with 2 heads takes 200M steps more to reach maximum performance than one with 4 heads on Enduro , but an agent with 4 heads performs exactly the same as one with 8 heads . In Berzerk , agents with 2 , 4 , and 8 heads all achieve similar scores . We chose 4 heads on the basis that 4 heads was never worse than 2 and occasionally better , while 8 heads was always very similar in performance to 4 heads . * Missing citation We will add this to the next version . * Coarseness of attention We checked on ImageNet , and the performance difference was negligible . The granularity isn \u2019 t particularly important for this dataset because the objects to classify are quite large and there \u2019 s no need to have a particularly fine level of attention . * Sampling of actions after every RNN iteration We sample a model action after every iteration . We did not try to run the RNN multiple times before sampling the action , but our general intuition is that the frame rate in ATARI is high enough that this is generally not needed .

In terms of differences , first we would say that the existence of the question as guidance to the controller in MAC is a fundamental difference mainly because it serves as a very strong top-down bias for the vision ( read ) module - it \u2019 s not just in the initialization of the reasoning , but throughout the whole process . In the RL case you could think of the reward as having a somewhat related role , but we feel this is a big difference . Second , our model is trained end-to-end so the vision can adapt and produce keys/values which are task relevant - MAC uses a pre-trained ImageNet module ( though we don \u2019 t argue MAC can \u2019 t be learned end-to-end , it \u2019 s just that it wasn \u2019 t , and in the RL tasks we use , it \u2019 s not clear what pre-trained network would be useful ) . Lastly , MAC does not use a spatial basis of any sort , so it can \u2019 t reason about absolute positioning as well as limited relative positioning ( trip wires , for example , wouldn \u2019 t be possible without this ) . * Number of attention heads We observe that having only a single head produces substantially lower scores across a number of levels on ATARI and other environments . We also see noticeable dropoff in performance in several levels beyond 8 heads . Beyond that the answer is strongly level-dependent . For example , an agent with 2 heads takes 200M steps more to reach maximum performance than one with 4 heads on Enduro , but an agent with 4 heads performs exactly the same as one with 8 heads . In Berzerk , agents with 2 , 4 , and 8 heads all achieve similar scores . We chose 4 heads on the basis that 4 heads was never worse than 2 and occasionally better , while 8 heads was always very similar in performance to 4 heads . * Missing citation We will add this to the next version . * Coarseness of attention We checked on ImageNet , and the performance difference was negligible . The granularity isn \u2019 t particularly important for this dataset because the objects to classify are quite large and there \u2019 s no need to have a particularly fine level of attention . * Sampling of actions after every RNN iteration We sample a model action after every iteration . We did not try to run the RNN multiple times before sampling the action , but our general intuition is that the frame rate in ATARI is high enough that this is generally not needed . Indeed , we effectively sample an action after every four frames , because our model uses action repeat to speed up training ( this is mentioned briefly in appendix A.1.1 ) ."}}
