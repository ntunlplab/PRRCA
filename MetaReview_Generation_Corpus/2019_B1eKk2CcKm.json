Narrow and incomplete view of RNA-seq tools/pipelines/application: ------------------ \u201cReducing this rich data to only the detection of annotated genes [...] is not appropriate for analysis\u201d. Modern RNA-seq pipelines also perform quantification and differential analysis at a minimum. The description of the standard RNA-seq experiment is problematic: Sequencing is of cDNA after reverse transcription, not RNA.

There are strategies implemented in commonly used tools such as STAR, kallisto, and others to detect these and other structural variants.

Experiments are for only four genes, two at a time with a 2-dimensional embedding. Unclear how patterns will hold when considering k-mers from more genes simultaneously or how embedding could scale.

Identification of abnormalities are described only by visual inspection, which is unlikely to scale as more k-mers are added and/or if the dimensionality of the embedding increases. Experiments without context to existing literature and are not annotation free ---------------------------------------- The paper describes that existing methods are limited by their dependence on annotations. The paper does not describe existing methods using annotations designed to address tasks/applications suggested for the new model. The paper does not compare developed model to these existing methods. To make the experiments performed in the paper computationally tractable, RNA-seq reads are aligned to the reference genome (annotations of sequence) and sequences in specific regions, defined with respect to genes of interest (annotations of genes). The experiments are therefore dependent on annotation although they lose their information/interpretability in this context. The paper notes that many kmers are not included in exonic sequences according to exact matches to annotations of coding sequence. Nonetheless, these reads are in this dataset, which means they are also identified by standard tools/annotations despite their differences. In Figure 3, embedding overlap between kmers in the annotated coding sequence of ZFX and ZFY are illustrated. It would be helpful to show the proportions of reads that were used for this analysis that mapped uniquely vs not to genomic intervals in these genes (reads rather than kmers). In this regard, the absence of any note or methods describing how reads were mapped (what method, with which parameters) to reference (which reference genome, which gene annotations) is a serious limitation. Other notes --------------------- The heatmap in Figure 5A is ambiguous and could be improved by better annotating what is on rows/columns, perhaps also including numeric information textually in addition to by color. Identification of kmers spanning translocation region (illustrated in embedding space by 5B) was done entirely without kmer2vec (identifying exclusive kmers, assembly of kmers, BLAST alignment to two chromosomes).

The method learns a representation that will result in a good predictor of kmer counts from the kmer sequence itself. The idea is that neighbouring kmers (from the same gene) would have similar counts (same gene expression), and hence would be embedded near to each other. The paper shows some small empirical experiments for 3 tasks: showing similar genes are close, able to distinguish different genes, and able to detect genomic structural variation. This is an interesting idea, and would have large impact if done well. However the current approach has multiple weaknesses which leave the proposal less strong that it could be. The paper is written clearly, and while the idea is motivated from word2vec and derivatives, the application to kmers is original. Overall comments: - There are two issues conflated in the word scalability: 1. computational scalability, where the authors need to run the method on a more realistic dataset and show that the LSTM converges. 2. statistical scalability, which I will expand in the next point. - The design of finding an embedding that will identify the count given a kmer has several weaknesses, which the paper did not address: 1. Two genes could have similar expression, hence similar kmer counts, but different kmers. 2. A kmer can appear in multiple genes, and the total count is the sum of all of them. 3. Copy number variation (since the paper is interested in cancer) would affect counts 4. Two kmers with only one or two differences could be due to SNPs. Should they be near or far? 5. Should we learn a representation for each individual, or a representation for the population?

This is tied up with a weakness that the paper does not measure the quality of the embedding, e.g. using reconstruction error.

While we could not cover everything in the rebuttal period time frame , here are some ways we addressed your comments > - The design of finding an embedding that will identify the count given a kmer has several weaknesses , which the paper did not address : 1 . Two genes could have similar expression , hence similar kmer counts , but different kmers . 2.A kmer can appear in multiple genes , and the total count is the sum of all of them . ( ... ) 4.Two kmers with only one or two differences could be due to SNPs . Should they be near or far ? We have in the beginning done some experiments on synthetic data . We added the plots generated from the synthetic data experiments to the Appendix . In short , we have generated 20 random strings of \u201c nucleotides \u201d we termed \u201c genes \u201d . We then extracted kmers from these strings and assigned them a count using a Poisson distribution . See the Appendix for more details . > 3.Copy number variation ( since the paper is interested in cancer ) would affect counts You are absolutely right ! However , we did not address this variability in this extended abstract , fault of space . We plan on investigating this in future work and have added to the text the following : \u201c Cancer cells have often unconventional genomes , many showing chromosomal rearrangements , mutations and repeated regions ( Weinstein et al. , 2013 ) . Copy number variations ( CNV ) are also quite common in cancer cells ( Shlien et al.2009 ) . \u201d > 5.Should we learn a representation for each individual , or a representation for the population ? Depending on how the sample id ( and hence vector v_i ) is used , one can get different effects . Excellent observation ! We did not include patient embedding space because we did not have the space in this extended abstract ."}}
