The main concerns of R1 and R3, who gave unfavorable scores, included lack of novelty and hence limited value of this work for the ML community. At the same time, R5 strongly advocates for acceptance and mentions meaningful contributions in the context of the specific application, including the new dataset. In response to that, the authors submitted a new revision and provided detailed responses to each of the reviews separately, which did not change the position of the reviewers.\nThe AC agrees with R1 and R3 that, even though the biometrics-related contributions are relevant, the scope of this work is too narrow and application-driven for presentation in the main track of ICLR. As a result, the final recommendation is reject.", "reviews": [{"review_id": "MG8Zde0ip6u-0", "review_text": "Summary : This paper proposes the use of siamese neural networks for the task of user verification by learning to identify their behavioral patterns of interaction with mobile phones or web browsers .
