The paper proposes a new methodology for training models in the presence of label noise . The method is a combination of standard SimCLR : using standard image augmentations and enforcing a contrastive consistence loss between the emeddings of the weakly augmented and strongly augmented versions of the same image . In addition , to the standard augmentation , the method also uses a Mixup style augmentation for the strongly augmented images : that is the projection of a randomly selected image is combined ( using a convex combination ) with the original image and then another contrastive loss is enforced for the class prototyle . The high dimensional embedding of the weakly augmented image is trained with the ( noisy ) label using a cross-entropy loss . In addition , the high dimensional embedding is also reconstructed from the low-dimensional projection . The final evaluation also contains a noise-cleaning step by generating pseudo-labels from the smooth-neighborhoods using the above embeddings . The quality of the writing is high and the paper presents a plausible combination of several strong methods . The paper is nicely written , well motivated and can be followed easily . The paper also presents significant improvement of artificially noisy versions of CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 . Also it is also measured on versions on which the images are noised by using extra datasets ( SVHN ) to create more interesting augmentations of the datasets . The weakness of the paper is that it is only measured on cifar-10/100 and these datasest are often not very representative of real noisy datasets with label noise of complicated structure . Another weakness is that this paper presents a relatively complex approach composed of 4 different methods , each of them are well studied and with very limited ablation analyses . It is plausible that the combined approach should do well , still it has limited novelty as it is the straightforward combination of four known approaches also the paper does not give a disciplined overview and study of the contributions of the different components .", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "reply_text": "We appreciate the reviewer \u2019 s valuable feedback .

The results are updated in Table 5 in the main text .

Note that the best existing method , DivideMix , also uses mixup as an important component . 4.Does hard labels lead to better performance than if soft labels are used ? \\ Using hard labels does lead to better performance than soft labels . We conjecture that the reason is due to the effect of entropy minimization by hard labels , where the classifier \u2019 s prediction is encouraged to be more confident . To verify this hypothesis , we added a sharpening function to the soft pseudo-labels similar as in DivideMix . With the sharpening , we are able to achieve comparable or even better results than using hard labels .

The paper takes one import issue in deep learning : learning from noisy data . 2.For me , the proposed supervised mixup prototypical contrastive loss is novel for learning with noisy data . Specifically , it injects structure knowledge of classes into embedding space by combining the mixup technique and prototypical contrastive loss . The design is reasonable and interesting . 3.This paper provides comprehensive experiments , including both qualitative analysis and quantitative results , to show the effectiveness of the proposed framework . In particular , the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art robust learning methods in learning with label noise , out-of-distribution input and input corruption . # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Cons : 1 . For the motivation , it would be better to provide more details about it , which seems not very clear to me . Particularly , it is unclear why the contrastive loss is duly used in the paper . Will the functionality of the unsupervised contrastive loss be achieved in the supervised prototypical loss ? Additionally , the prototypical contrastive loss in equation ( 1 ) is an InfoNCE with normalized mean embeddings as the prototypes , which seems different from the ProtoNCE in the original paper [ 1 ] . It is better to clarify the the differences of the formulation and training strategy , and the reason of design of supervised prototypical loss in this paper . [ 1 ] Junnan Li , Pan Zhou , Caiming Xiong , Richard Socher , and Steven C.H . Hoi.Prototypical Contrastive Learning of Unsupervised Representations , In ICLR , 2020 . 2.As the key contribution of this paper , mixup prototypical contrastive loss combines mixup technique and prototypical contrastive loss . In the appendix , the authors have provided ablation study to show the effect of proposed losses , and it shows that the mixup prototypical loss is most crucial to the model \u2019 s performance . Here , the authors utilizes mixup in two ways : first is to create virtual training samples , and the other is to define the mixup version of prototypical contrastive loss as an weighted combination of two prototypical contrastive loss with respect to true class and virtual class . However , the effect of mixup augmentation , prototypical contrastive loss and mixup prototypical contrastive loss are unclear . Since mixup has been shown to be an effective method against label noise , it would be more convincing if the authors can study the individual effect of each components of the proposed loss in the rebuttal period . 3.The proposed method uses many data augmentations , e.g. , standard crop and horizontal flip as weak augmentation and AugMix as strong augmentation in the unsupervised consistency contrastive loss , and mixup technique in the supervised prototypical contrastive loss . I am concerning about the fairness in the experimental comparison . It is unclear to me if the authors have applied the same data augmentation to all the compared methods . # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Questions during rebuttal period : Please address and clarify the cons above .", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We appreciate the reviewer \u2019 s positive comments and valuable feedback .

Better representation enables ( 1 ) better classifier performance , ( 2 ) better noise cleaning with nearest neighbors , ( 3 ) better robustness to out-of-distribution samples and input corruption . Contrastive learning has been shown as an effective approach for representation learning , thus the motivation . 2.Will the functionality of the unsupervised contrastive loss be achieved in the supervised prototypical loss ? \\ Firstly , we have revised \u201c supervised prototypical loss \u201d into \u201c weakly-supervised prototypical loss \u201d since the supervision comes from weak pseudo-labels . \\ The unsupervised and weakly-supervised contrastive loss play different roles in shaping the geometry of the embedding space . Specifically , the unsupervised consistency contrastive loss maps different augmentations of the same image to neighboring embeddings , and enforces different images to have different embeddings . It encourages the network to learn discriminative representation that is robust to low-level image corruption and ood samples . On the other hand , the weakly-supervised prototypical contrastive loss injects class-structural knowledge into the embedding space . It reduces the intra-class variance by clustering samples from the same class around the prototype , and increases the inter-class variance by pushing a sample away from the prototypes of negative classes . 3.Clarification of the formulation of the contrastive loss . \\ Eq . ( 1 ) describes the unsupervised contrastive loss that is the same as the InfoNCE loss in SimCLR . Eq . ( 3 ) describes the weakly-supervised prototypical contrastive loss that is a variation of the ProtoNCE loss in PCL ( Li et al.2020b ) .Different from the unsupervised ProtoNCE where prototypes are computed as cluster centroids , we compute a prototype for each class as the normalized averaged embedding for all samples whose pseudo-label predict this class . 4.Decouple the effect of mixup and prototypical contrastive loss . \\ Following the reviewer \u2019 s valuable suggestion , we have performed additional ablation experiments where mixup is removed and the regular prototypical contrastive loss is used . The results are updated in Table 5 in the main text . Using the prototypical contrastive loss ( 4th row ) leads to a substantial increase compared to the 1st row , but lower than our full method due to the removal of mixup .

The effectiveness of the proposed method has been evaluated on multiple simulated and real-world noisy datasets . # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Reasons for score : Overall , I vote for a weak acceptance . The proposed noise-robust contrastive learning introduces two contrastive losses : unsupervised consistency loss and supervised mixup prototypical loss . My major concern is about the clarity of the paper and some additional issues ( see cons below ) . Hopefully the authors can address my concern in the rebuttal period . # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Pros : 1 . The paper takes one import issue in deep learning : learning from noisy data . 2.For me , the proposed supervised mixup prototypical contrastive loss is novel for learning with noisy data . Specifically , it injects structure knowledge of classes into embedding space by combining the mixup technique and prototypical contrastive loss . The design is reasonable and interesting . 3.This paper provides comprehensive experiments , including both qualitative analysis and quantitative results , to show the effectiveness of the proposed framework . In particular , the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art robust learning methods in learning with label noise , out-of-distribution input and input corruption . # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Cons : 1 . For the motivation , it would be better to provide more details about it , which seems not very clear to me . Particularly , it is unclear why the contrastive loss is duly used in the paper . Will the functionality of the unsupervised contrastive loss be achieved in the supervised prototypical loss ? Additionally , the prototypical contrastive loss in equation ( 1 ) is an InfoNCE with normalized mean embeddings as the prototypes , which seems different from the ProtoNCE in the original paper [ 1 ] . It is better to clarify the the differences of the formulation and training strategy , and the reason of design of supervised prototypical loss in this paper .

Hoi.Prototypical Contrastive Learning of Unsupervised Representations , In ICLR , 2020 . 2.As the key contribution of this paper , mixup prototypical contrastive loss combines mixup technique and prototypical contrastive loss . In the appendix , the authors have provided ablation study to show the effect of proposed losses , and it shows that the mixup prototypical loss is most crucial to the model \u2019 s performance . Here , the authors utilizes mixup in two ways : first is to create virtual training samples , and the other is to define the mixup version of prototypical contrastive loss as an weighted combination of two prototypical contrastive loss with respect to true class and virtual class . However , the effect of mixup augmentation , prototypical contrastive loss and mixup prototypical contrastive loss are unclear . Since mixup has been shown to be an effective method against label noise , it would be more convincing if the authors can study the individual effect of each components of the proposed loss in the rebuttal period . 3.The proposed method uses many data augmentations , e.g. , standard crop and horizontal flip as weak augmentation and AugMix as strong augmentation in the unsupervised consistency contrastive loss , and mixup technique in the supervised prototypical contrastive loss . I am concerning about the fairness in the experimental comparison . It is unclear to me if the authors have applied the same data augmentation to all the compared methods . # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Questions during rebuttal period : Please address and clarify the cons above .", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We appreciate the reviewer \u2019 s positive comments and valuable feedback . Here are our responses to the concerns : 1 . Motivation of using contrastive learning . \\ Different from most existing works in learning from noisy data , our method addresses this problem by learning robust representation . Better representation enables ( 1 ) better classifier performance , ( 2 ) better noise cleaning with nearest neighbors , ( 3 ) better robustness to out-of-distribution samples and input corruption . Contrastive learning has been shown as an effective approach for representation learning , thus the motivation . 2.Will the functionality of the unsupervised contrastive loss be achieved in the supervised prototypical loss ? \\ Firstly , we have revised \u201c supervised prototypical loss \u201d into \u201c weakly-supervised prototypical loss \u201d since the supervision comes from weak pseudo-labels . \\ The unsupervised and weakly-supervised contrastive loss play different roles in shaping the geometry of the embedding space . Specifically , the unsupervised consistency contrastive loss maps different augmentations of the same image to neighboring embeddings , and enforces different images to have different embeddings . It encourages the network to learn discriminative representation that is robust to low-level image corruption and ood samples . On the other hand , the weakly-supervised prototypical contrastive loss injects class-structural knowledge into the embedding space . It reduces the intra-class variance by clustering samples from the same class around the prototype , and increases the inter-class variance by pushing a sample away from the prototypes of negative classes . 3.Clarification of the formulation of the contrastive loss . \\ Eq . ( 1 ) describes the unsupervised contrastive loss that is the same as the InfoNCE loss in SimCLR . Eq . ( 3 ) describes the weakly-supervised prototypical contrastive loss that is a variation of the ProtoNCE loss in PCL ( Li et al.2020b ) .Different from the unsupervised ProtoNCE where prototypes are computed as cluster centroids , we compute a prototype for each class as the normalized averaged embedding for all samples whose pseudo-label predict this class . 4.Decouple the effect of mixup and prototypical contrastive loss . \\ Following the reviewer \u2019 s valuable suggestion , we have performed additional ablation experiments where mixup is removed and the regular prototypical contrastive loss is used . The results are updated in Table 5 in the main text . Using the prototypical contrastive loss ( 4th row ) leads to a substantial increase compared to the 1st row , but lower than our full method due to the removal of mixup . Note that the best existing method , DivideMix , also uses mixup as an important component . 5.Results using standard augmentation . \\ Following the reviewer \u2019 s valuable suggestion , we have performed experiments with the standard crop-and-flip augmentation instead of AugMix . The results are updated in Table 5 . Despite some slight decrease in accuracy , our method with standard augmentation still achieves state-of-the-art performance . Thanks again for your review .
