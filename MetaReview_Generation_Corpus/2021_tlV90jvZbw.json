Taking also into account the responses to the other reviews , my positive view of the paper has been confirmed and I have therefore increased my score . Summary : The paper deals with the phenomenon of double descent as a function of training time and offers an alternative explanation as a superposition of bias-variance tradeoffs with minima at different epochs . The analysis is first done theoretically for an early stopped linear least squares problem with different scalings of the features as well as a two-layer network . For both cases it is shown theoretically that the risk function is approximated by a function consisting of overlapping bias-variance tradeoffs . By controlling the stepsizes and initializations it is then possible to mitigate double descent . Motivated by this theory , the authors then consider two recent architectures empirically , a 5-layer CNN and a ResNet model , and show experimentally how double descent can be avoided by adapting the stepsizes corresponding to the last layers . Strengths : - The paper provides a novel theoretical explanation of the epoch-wise double descent phenomenon , which recently has gained some interest in the community . Understanding the epoch-wise descent better is important to better understand early stopping in neural networks . - The theory also suggests a simple and effective mitigation strategy by adaptation of the different stepsizes corresponding to the different U-shaped curves appearing in the approximate risk formulation . This strategy is shown to work not only for the theoretically analyzed models , but also empirically on two common standard architectures , namely 5-layer CNN and ResNet . Thus it may have significant impact for the practical performance of neural networks and may be adopted by the community . - The paper is well-written , well-motivated , and relatively easy to follow , taking into account the technical nature of the problem . Questions : - By choosing the stepsizes according to Prop . 1 , we achieve the lowest value of the approximate risk expression ( 1 ) . However , since the quality of the approximation in ( 2 ) also depends on the choices of the stepsizes , how can we make the conclusion that this also corresponds to the lowest risk ? - In the discussion after Theorem 2 , I do not quite understand what is meant by the statement `` the theorem pertains to the kernel regime where the network behaves similar to an associated linear model '' . Maybe you could elaborate a bit on this statement . Conclusion : Overall , the paper constitutes a solid contribution to the understanding of epoch-wise double descent as well as a practical way to mitigate and improve the early stopping performance . Moreover , the paper is well-written and technically sound . I vote for acceptance .

The claim is that double descent is caused by the superposition of multiple bias-variance trade-offs arising from the fact that different parts of the network are trained at different speeds . To corroborate this claim , the following main results are presented : ( 1 ) Analytical results for linear regression in the under-parameterized regime ( input dimension $ d $ much smaller than the number of training samples $ n $ ) . In particular , it is shown that the risk of gradient descent is close to the sum of $ d $ U-shaped curves ( this is dubbed as the `` risk of early stopped least squares '' ) . The bound depends on the covariance structure of the model and , in case such a structure is known , one can optimize the learning rates associated to the various components so as to minimize the risk . ( 2 ) Analytical results for two-layer networks in the `` lazy regime '' . The author ( s ) provide an upper bound on the risk which has again the form of the sum of U-shaped curves . The bound depends on the singular values/vectors of the Gram matrix associated to the network . By estimating ( or knowing in advance ) the spectrum of such a Gram matrix , one can eliminate the double descent phenomenon and optimize the risk . ( 3 ) Empirical results showing how to mitigate the phenomenon of double descent by choosing different step sizes for different layers ( or different components ) . The author ( s ) provide results both for the toy models analyzed theoretically ( see Figure 1 and 3 ) and for neural networks used in practice ( 5 layer CNN and ResNet-18 trained on CIFAR , see Figure 4 in the main paper and Figure 6 in the Appendix ) . The analysis for linear regression is quite simple . The analysis for the two-layer network is more involved and it heavily relies on previous literature , in particular recent work by Heckel & Soltanolkotabi . Overall , the paper is well written , the results appear correct ( although I did not do a thorough check on the appendix ) , and the perspective proposed by the paper is fresh and interesting . However , I am not fully persuaded of the impact that the results of the submission will have on the community . In fact , the paper presents the following major weaknesses : ( a ) Theorem 2 provides an upper bound on the risk of two-layer networks . However , there is no indication of how good this upper bound actually is . Is it tight in any way ? Does it even go to 0 as n and t grow ? It seems that the bound on the risk comes from a bound on the training error , and the training error is known to vanish ( as $ n $ and $ t $ grow ) in the over-parameterized regime considered here . However , after staring at the formula for a while , it is not obvious to me that the RHS of ( 5 ) can be made arbitrarily small ( by taking sufficiently large $ t , n $ ) . ( b ) The risk of early stopped least squares seems to vanish by taking sufficiently large $ n , t $ . However , the dependence on t of the RHS of ( 2 ) is not clear . There is no explicit t in the formula . Is the dependence hidden in the numerical constant c ? ( c ) The numerical results in Section 4 are not convincing . The double descent phenomenon appears mitigated , but the test error improves only slightly for the 5-layer CNN ( Figure 4 ) and it is even worse for ResNet-18 ( Figure 6 in the appendix ) . I agree with the author ( s ) that choosing different learning rates can mitigate double descent . However , it is not clear at all whether this would actually improve performance at the scale of a practical network . Minor points : ( d ) Is it possible to provide bounds on linear regression in the over-parameterized regime ? Do you expect to obtain results somewhat similar to ( Hastie et al. , 2019 ) ? ( e ) Can you make the probability of Theorem 1 arbitrarily close to 1 ? Now , it is at best 1-2e^ { -32 } . ( f ) Could you add some technical details explaining how your approach differs from the vast literature on the analysis of two-layer networks in the lazy regime ? This would help assess the technical novelty of the paper . -- UPDATE AFTER AUTHORS RESPONSE : The authors partially addressed my concerns and I ( slightly ) increased my score .", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Many thanks for the review . We are encouraged that the reviewer found that the `` perspective proposed by the paper is fresh and interesting '' . ( a ) The reviewer is concerned about the risk bound ( 5 ) for two-layer networks , specifically on whether it is tight and whether it goes to zero as n and t increases . The bound consists of two terms , the first describes the training error and the second is a bound on the generalization error . The term describing the training error is tight ( up to a vanishing error ) and goes to zero as $ t \\rightarrow \\infty $ . Regarding the tightness of the generalization bound ; the generalization bound is trivially tight for $ t=0 $ and we are not aware of any tighter bounds for the general setup we consider even for simpler one-layer networks . The bound is not a weakness of our analysis , but a consequence of a rather general problem setup . Note that we only assume that the training examples ( x , y ) are drawn from some distribution . The reviewer remarks that `` it is not obvious that the RHS ( 5 ) can be made arbitrarily small ( by taking sufficiently large t , n ) '' : Note that , even for $ t \\rightarrow \\infty $ , the risk is not arbitrary small , for any iteration $ t $ , because the data might be generated from a distribution that the two-layer network can not describe and because there might be an irreducible error . This is true even in simple linear setups ( see A.2 on the risk decomposition into bias , variance , and irreducible error ) . Moreover , note that the minimum of the risk is not always achieved at $ t \\rightarrow \\infty $ . ( b ) On `` The risk of early stopped least-squares seems to vanish by taking sufficiently large n , t '' : That is not true , the risk does not vanish for sufficiently large n in general ( because there is an irreducible error due to data being drawn from a linear model $ y = x^T \\theta + z $ ) . Moreover , the minimum of the risk is in general not achieved for $ t \\rightarrow \\infty $ ; see Figure 1 , right panel , for an example . On `` the dependence on $ t $ of the RHS of ( 2 ) is not clear '' : The RHS of ( 2 ) provides a bound on how much the risk deviates from the risk expression . This bound is valid for all $ t $ , and does not depend on $ t $ . ( c ) The reviewer remarks that it is unclear `` whether double descent mitigation would improve performance at the scale of a practical network '' : We already show that our double descent mitigation strategy works for a five layer CNN , and in our revision we now also show that it works for ResNet-18 . We think that ResNet-18 is a practical network . Of course , we would be happy to further investigate this . If the reviewer suggests a practical setup where epoch-wise double descent has been reported to occur at `` the scale of a practical network '' , then we are happy to do our best to investigate whether our strategy enables mitigation in this setup , and add it to the paper . However , we would also like to mention that the main purpose of our paper is to understand epoch-wise double descent , and we are not claiming that our mitigation strategy gives uniformly and significantly better performance . We have shown , however , that in a standard 5-layer CNN it improves the classification error from $ 0.22 $ to $ 0.14 $ , which we find significant . We have also shown that it improves performance for ResNet-18 trained on noisy CIFAR-10 by 2 percent , which again , we find significant . ( d ) Can we study the over-parameterized regime in the linear case and do we obtain similar results than Hastie et al . ? That 's a great question ; we have studied the overparameterized regime for the two-layer network but not for the linear model in Section 2 . It is non-trivial to extend our results from the under to the over-parameterized regime , and it would require studying a slightly different model , e.g. , that of Hastie et al.We do not expect to get a similar result to Hastie et al.got ; specifically for their setup the curve for epoch-wise double descent does not have the same shape as that for model-wise double descent , in particular , there is no analog of the risk exploding at the interpolation threshold for epoch-wise double descent . ( e ) Can we make $ 1-e^ { -32 } $ arbitrary small ? Yes , we can . This comes at the cost of the RHS in ( 2 ) to slightly increase , however . ( f ) Technical details explaining how our approach differs from the vast literature on the analysis of two-layer networks in the lazy regime : We are not aware of any other result in the literature that explains the training dynamics of a two-layer network where * both * the first and second layer are training . For our conclusion , however , it is critical to allow both weights to change , because epoch-wise double descent arises in two-layer networks because the weights are learned at different speeds . This technical difference to existing works is non-trivial as detailed in our proofs ."}, {"review_id": "tlV90jvZbw-3", "review_text": "UPDATE : The authors have addressed my concerns and I have therefore increased my score . This work proposes an explanation for the double-descent phenomenon observed by Nakkiran et al.as a function of training time , in models with significant label corruption . Classical theory suggests that the test loss should follow a U-shaped curve , where the model initially learns but then overfits . The proposed explanation is that the observed double-descent curve is a superposition of two such U-shaped curves , each originating from a different underlying `` scale '' . This is demonstrated in the context of linear models trained with MSE loss and noisy labels : Each eigenmode of the kernel independently leads to a U-shaped curve in the test loss , and the time scale for each curve is a function of the corresponding eigenvalue . A similar effect is shown for wide 2-layer networks , using wide network theory to relate this network to a linear model . In this case the two scales in the kernel originate from an imbalance between the two layers . The double descent effect can be eliminated by adjusting the initialization scales ( or learning rates ) of the two layers . As a test of this proposal , it is shown empirically that double descent can similarly be eliminated in ResNet-18 and another model by adjusting the learning rates of different layers . The paper presents this as a way to mitigate double descent , although it is not clear that this is beneficial . First , the double descent effect happens relatively quickly ( it is over in a fraction of the time it takes to train the network ) . Second , in the example of ResNet-18 , the network that exhibits double-descent ends up performing better than the network where double-descent is mitigated . I do think that the explanation suggested for the origin of double descent is plausible and valuable . In particular , it neatly explains why label noise enhances the effect . Following the proposed explanation , it is not clear to me why models exhibit double-descent and not multi-descent behavior . Given the linear model results , it is possible to engineer linear setups with any number of separate U-shaped curves . Why are there only two typical scales rather than multiple such scales in typical deep learning setups ? The paper suggests that the main imbalance is between the last layer and all the previous layers ( why ? ) , but based on the ResNet-18 results it seems the imbalance can happen in other parts of the network as well . Things that would lead me to increase my rating : 1 . A clear explanation of why we observe double descent rather than `` multi descent '' in typical deep learning setups . 2.Clarifying the connection ( even if only empirically ) between mitigating double descent and final model performance . The two convolution networks shown in the paper point to different conclusion . One way to strengthen the conclusion would be to scan over the per-layer learning rates , and determine whether the optimal learning rates in terms of performance do or do not exhibit double descent .

Also , we highly appreciated that the reviewer named two points that would lead them to increase the rating , and have addressed both of them with new empirical results that we have added to the paper . It is a great question on why there is no multiple descent . We have added a new section in the appendix ( Appendix C ) where we explain that multiple descent can occur , and where we show two concrete examples , one for the linear model and one for the two-layer network where multiple-descent occurs . We also added a paragraph explaining that multiple descent could in principle also in practice , but as illustrated by our multi-descent example for the two-layer network , this requires a very particular setup of model , training , and training distribution , and in all natural setups ( such as training CIFAR-10 and MNIST ) this situation simply does not occur . A second main comment was to clarify the connection between mitigating double descent and final model performance . In our previous appendix , we had a simulation where double descent was mitigated when training ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10 , but the final model performance was not improved . Now we followed the reviewers suggestion to investigate this and have found a better parameter setup where only through changing the stepsizes , the epoch wise double descent gets mitigated * and * the model has a better performance than the original training setup . Now all parts of our paper are consistent in that for i ) the linear model ii ) the two-layer network iii ) the five layer ConvNet and iv ) ResNet-18 mitigating double descent through stepsize selection improved the final model performance .

For such a large test set size , 95 % Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals have roughly the size of the line with and are therefore not shown ( as common in the literature ) . The hyperparameters are the standard hyperparameters for training those networks ; we have provided the code ( jupyter notebooks ) which enables easy reproduction of the results . We do not see how it is possible to construct an `` artificial case to support the claims '' by changing the hyperparameters . Regarding Theorem 1 , we specified that `` the difference of the early stopped risk and the risk expression in ( 1 ) at iteration $ t $ is at most '' , to specify that the statement is for a given iteration . With a union bound , this trivially holds for iterations $ 1 , \\ldots , T $ , with an extra factor $ T $ in the probability bound . Regarding `` In Figure 4 , test errors ( and training errors ) are much better for the case of ii at the beginning of training , epoch = 1 . Can you report the values at epoch = 0 to make sure that both are the same initially ? '' : The test errors are exactly the same at initialization as we initialize with the same deterministic random seed for all runs ( please see our provided supplementary code ) ."}, "1": {"review_id": "tlV90jvZbw-1", "review_text": "UPDATE : The authors have addressed my concerns . Taking also into account the responses to the other reviews , my positive view of the paper has been confirmed and I have therefore increased my score . Summary : The paper deals with the phenomenon of double descent as a function of training time and offers an alternative explanation as a superposition of bias-variance tradeoffs with minima at different epochs . The analysis is first done theoretically for an early stopped linear least squares problem with different scalings of the features as well as a two-layer network . For both cases it is shown theoretically that the risk function is approximated by a function consisting of overlapping bias-variance tradeoffs . By controlling the stepsizes and initializations it is then possible to mitigate double descent . Motivated by this theory , the authors then consider two recent architectures empirically , a 5-layer CNN and a ResNet model , and show experimentally how double descent can be avoided by adapting the stepsizes corresponding to the last layers . Strengths : - The paper provides a novel theoretical explanation of the epoch-wise double descent phenomenon , which recently has gained some interest in the community . Understanding the epoch-wise descent better is important to better understand early stopping in neural networks . - The theory also suggests a simple and effective mitigation strategy by adaptation of the different stepsizes corresponding to the different U-shaped curves appearing in the approximate risk formulation . This strategy is shown to work not only for the theoretically analyzed models , but also empirically on two common standard architectures , namely 5-layer CNN and ResNet . Thus it may have significant impact for the practical performance of neural networks and may be adopted by the community . - The paper is well-written , well-motivated , and relatively easy to follow , taking into account the technical nature of the problem . Questions : - By choosing the stepsizes according to Prop . 1 , we achieve the lowest value of the approximate risk expression ( 1 ) . However , since the quality of the approximation in ( 2 ) also depends on the choices of the stepsizes , how can we make the conclusion that this also corresponds to the lowest risk ? - In the discussion after Theorem 2 , I do not quite understand what is meant by the statement `` the theorem pertains to the kernel regime where the network behaves similar to an associated linear model '' . Maybe you could elaborate a bit on this statement . Conclusion : Overall , the paper constitutes a solid contribution to the understanding of epoch-wise double descent as well as a practical way to mitigate and improve the early stopping performance . Moreover , the paper is well-written and technically sound . I vote for acceptance .

The claim is that double descent is caused by the superposition of multiple bias-variance trade-offs arising from the fact that different parts of the network are trained at different speeds . To corroborate this claim , the following main results are presented : ( 1 ) Analytical results for linear regression in the under-parameterized regime ( input dimension $ d $ much smaller than the number of training samples $ n $ ) . In particular , it is shown that the risk of gradient descent is close to the sum of $ d $ U-shaped curves ( this is dubbed as the `` risk of early stopped least squares '' ) . The bound depends on the covariance structure of the model and , in case such a structure is known , one can optimize the learning rates associated to the various components so as to minimize the risk . ( 2 ) Analytical results for two-layer networks in the `` lazy regime '' . The author ( s ) provide an upper bound on the risk which has again the form of the sum of U-shaped curves . The bound depends on the singular values/vectors of the Gram matrix associated to the network . By estimating ( or knowing in advance ) the spectrum of such a Gram matrix , one can eliminate the double descent phenomenon and optimize the risk . ( 3 ) Empirical results showing how to mitigate the phenomenon of double descent by choosing different step sizes for different layers ( or different components ) . The author ( s ) provide results both for the toy models analyzed theoretically ( see Figure 1 and 3 ) and for neural networks used in practice ( 5 layer CNN and ResNet-18 trained on CIFAR , see Figure 4 in the main paper and Figure 6 in the Appendix ) . The analysis for linear regression is quite simple . The analysis for the two-layer network is more involved and it heavily relies on previous literature , in particular recent work by Heckel & Soltanolkotabi . Overall , the paper is well written , the results appear correct ( although I did not do a thorough check on the appendix ) , and the perspective proposed by the paper is fresh and interesting . However , I am not fully persuaded of the impact that the results of the submission will have on the community . In fact , the paper presents the following major weaknesses : ( a ) Theorem 2 provides an upper bound on the risk of two-layer networks . However , there is no indication of how good this upper bound actually is . Is it tight in any way ? Does it even go to 0 as n and t grow ? It seems that the bound on the risk comes from a bound on the training error , and the training error is known to vanish ( as $ n $ and $ t $ grow ) in the over-parameterized regime considered here . However , after staring at the formula for a while , it is not obvious to me that the RHS of ( 5 ) can be made arbitrarily small ( by taking sufficiently large $ t , n $ ) . ( b ) The risk of early stopped least squares seems to vanish by taking sufficiently large $ n , t $ . However , the dependence on t of the RHS of ( 2 ) is not clear . There is no explicit t in the formula . Is the dependence hidden in the numerical constant c ? ( c ) The numerical results in Section 4 are not convincing . The double descent phenomenon appears mitigated , but the test error improves only slightly for the 5-layer CNN ( Figure 4 ) and it is even worse for ResNet-18 ( Figure 6 in the appendix ) . I agree with the author ( s ) that choosing different learning rates can mitigate double descent . However , it is not clear at all whether this would actually improve performance at the scale of a practical network . Minor points : ( d ) Is it possible to provide bounds on linear regression in the over-parameterized regime ? Do you expect to obtain results somewhat similar to ( Hastie et al. , 2019 ) ? ( e ) Can you make the probability of Theorem 1 arbitrarily close to 1 ? Now , it is at best 1-2e^ { -32 } . ( f ) Could you add some technical details explaining how your approach differs from the vast literature on the analysis of two-layer networks in the lazy regime ? This would help assess the technical novelty of the paper . -- UPDATE AFTER AUTHORS RESPONSE : The authors partially addressed my concerns and I ( slightly ) increased my score .", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Many thanks for the review . We are encouraged that the reviewer found that the `` perspective proposed by the paper is fresh and interesting '' . ( a ) The reviewer is concerned about the risk bound ( 5 ) for two-layer networks , specifically on whether it is tight and whether it goes to zero as n and t increases . The bound consists of two terms , the first describes the training error and the second is a bound on the generalization error . The term describing the training error is tight ( up to a vanishing error ) and goes to zero as $ t \\rightarrow \\infty $ . Regarding the tightness of the generalization bound ; the generalization bound is trivially tight for $ t=0 $ and we are not aware of any tighter bounds for the general setup we consider even for simpler one-layer networks . The bound is not a weakness of our analysis , but a consequence of a rather general problem setup . Note that we only assume that the training examples ( x , y ) are drawn from some distribution . The reviewer remarks that `` it is not obvious that the RHS ( 5 ) can be made arbitrarily small ( by taking sufficiently large t , n ) '' : Note that , even for $ t \\rightarrow \\infty $ , the risk is not arbitrary small , for any iteration $ t $ , because the data might be generated from a distribution that the two-layer network can not describe and because there might be an irreducible error . This is true even in simple linear setups ( see A.2 on the risk decomposition into bias , variance , and irreducible error ) . Moreover , note that the minimum of the risk is not always achieved at $ t \\rightarrow \\infty $ . ( b ) On `` The risk of early stopped least-squares seems to vanish by taking sufficiently large n , t '' : That is not true , the risk does not vanish for sufficiently large n in general ( because there is an irreducible error due to data being drawn from a linear model $ y = x^T \\theta + z $ ) . Moreover , the minimum of the risk is in general not achieved for $ t \\rightarrow \\infty $ ; see Figure 1 , right panel , for an example . On `` the dependence on $ t $ of the RHS of ( 2 ) is not clear '' : The RHS of ( 2 ) provides a bound on how much the risk deviates from the risk expression . This bound is valid for all $ t $ , and does not depend on $ t $ . ( c ) The reviewer remarks that it is unclear `` whether double descent mitigation would improve performance at the scale of a practical network '' : We already show that our double descent mitigation strategy works for a five layer CNN , and in our revision we now also show that it works for ResNet-18 . We think that ResNet-18 is a practical network . Of course , we would be happy to further investigate this . If the reviewer suggests a practical setup where epoch-wise double descent has been reported to occur at `` the scale of a practical network '' , then we are happy to do our best to investigate whether our strategy enables mitigation in this setup , and add it to the paper . However , we would also like to mention that the main purpose of our paper is to understand epoch-wise double descent , and we are not claiming that our mitigation strategy gives uniformly and significantly better performance . We have shown , however , that in a standard 5-layer CNN it improves the classification error from $ 0.22 $ to $ 0.14 $ , which we find significant . We have also shown that it improves performance for ResNet-18 trained on noisy CIFAR-10 by 2 percent , which again , we find significant . ( d ) Can we study the over-parameterized regime in the linear case and do we obtain similar results than Hastie et al . ? That 's a great question ; we have studied the overparameterized regime for the two-layer network but not for the linear model in Section 2 . It is non-trivial to extend our results from the under to the over-parameterized regime , and it would require studying a slightly different model , e.g. , that of Hastie et al.We do not expect to get a similar result to Hastie et al.got ; specifically for their setup the curve for epoch-wise double descent does not have the same shape as that for model-wise double descent , in particular , there is no analog of the risk exploding at the interpolation threshold for epoch-wise double descent . ( e ) Can we make $ 1-e^ { -32 } $ arbitrary small ? Yes , we can . This comes at the cost of the RHS in ( 2 ) to slightly increase , however . ( f ) Technical details explaining how our approach differs from the vast literature on the analysis of two-layer networks in the lazy regime : We are not aware of any other result in the literature that explains the training dynamics of a two-layer network where * both * the first and second layer are training . For our conclusion , however , it is critical to allow both weights to change , because epoch-wise double descent arises in two-layer networks because the weights are learned at different speeds . This technical difference to existing works is non-trivial as detailed in our proofs ."}, "3": {"review_id": "tlV90jvZbw-3", "review_text": "UPDATE : The authors have addressed my concerns and I have therefore increased my score . This work proposes an explanation for the double-descent phenomenon observed by Nakkiran et al.as a function of training time , in models with significant label corruption . Classical theory suggests that the test loss should follow a U-shaped curve , where the model initially learns but then overfits . The proposed explanation is that the observed double-descent curve is a superposition of two such U-shaped curves , each originating from a different underlying `` scale '' . This is demonstrated in the context of linear models trained with MSE loss and noisy labels : Each eigenmode of the kernel independently leads to a U-shaped curve in the test loss , and the time scale for each curve is a function of the corresponding eigenvalue . A similar effect is shown for wide 2-layer networks , using wide network theory to relate this network to a linear model . In this case the two scales in the kernel originate from an imbalance between the two layers . The double descent effect can be eliminated by adjusting the initialization scales ( or learning rates ) of the two layers . As a test of this proposal , it is shown empirically that double descent can similarly be eliminated in ResNet-18 and another model by adjusting the learning rates of different layers . The paper presents this as a way to mitigate double descent , although it is not clear that this is beneficial . First , the double descent effect happens relatively quickly ( it is over in a fraction of the time it takes to train the network ) . Second , in the example of ResNet-18 , the network that exhibits double-descent ends up performing better than the network where double-descent is mitigated . I do think that the explanation suggested for the origin of double descent is plausible and valuable . In particular , it neatly explains why label noise enhances the effect . Following the proposed explanation , it is not clear to me why models exhibit double-descent and not multi-descent behavior . Given the linear model results , it is possible to engineer linear setups with any number of separate U-shaped curves . Why are there only two typical scales rather than multiple such scales in typical deep learning setups ? The paper suggests that the main imbalance is between the last layer and all the previous layers ( why ? ) , but based on the ResNet-18 results it seems the imbalance can happen in other parts of the network as well . Things that would lead me to increase my rating : 1 . A clear explanation of why we observe double descent rather than `` multi descent '' in typical deep learning setups . 2.Clarifying the connection ( even if only empirically ) between mitigating double descent and final model performance . The two convolution networks shown in the paper point to different conclusion . One way to strengthen the conclusion would be to scan over the per-layer learning rates , and determine whether the optimal learning rates in terms of performance do or do not exhibit double descent . Typos and nits : - `` such as a neural networks '' - `` explains why neural network often '' - Below Theorem 2 it says `` for a very related Gram matrix '' . What does `` very related '' mean in this context ?", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "reply_text": "Thanks for the review and for noting that our explanation for the origin of double descent is `` plausible and valuable '' , and that it `` neatly explains why label noise enhances the effect \u2019 \u2019 . Also , we highly appreciated that the reviewer named two points that would lead them to increase the rating , and have addressed both of them with new empirical results that we have added to the paper . It is a great question on why there is no multiple descent . We have added a new section in the appendix ( Appendix C ) where we explain that multiple descent can occur , and where we show two concrete examples , one for the linear model and one for the two-layer network where multiple-descent occurs . We also added a paragraph explaining that multiple descent could in principle also in practice , but as illustrated by our multi-descent example for the two-layer network , this requires a very particular setup of model , training , and training distribution , and in all natural setups ( such as training CIFAR-10 and MNIST ) this situation simply does not occur . A second main comment was to clarify the connection between mitigating double descent and final model performance . In our previous appendix , we had a simulation where double descent was mitigated when training ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10 , but the final model performance was not improved . Now we followed the reviewers suggestion to investigate this and have found a better parameter setup where only through changing the stepsizes , the epoch wise double descent gets mitigated * and * the model has a better performance than the original training setup . Now all parts of our paper are consistent in that for i ) the linear model ii ) the two-layer network iii ) the five layer ConvNet and iv ) ResNet-18 mitigating double descent through stepsize selection improved the final model performance .
