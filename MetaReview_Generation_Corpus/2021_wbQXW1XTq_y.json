We assume access to simulators for each specific scenario ( CLEVR , Dining-Sim and Drive-Sim ) . The reason is that Sim2SG needs a synthetic data generator to generate label aligned synthetic data .

With a large collection of assets ( e.g.ShapeNet [ 5 ] ) , access to open source simulators [ 2,6,7 ] and exciting work around object mesh generation [ 4,8 ] , we think that this issue is mitigated .

It would help to add another sentences describing it . - I enjoyed reading the discussion provided in Sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 . - Currently , the work does not discuss any limitations .

Scene graphs are extracted in a two-step process , mapping input to an intermediate latent space and generating the final prediction from the latent space . The authors decompose the content gap into two components : ( a ) label discrepancy , i.e.how much do the label distributions between the two domains differ , and ( b ) prediction discrepancy , i.e.the difference in distributions of outputs predicted from the latent space for the two domains . They further model the appearance gap by aligning the latent representation for both domains after accounting for the content gap ( to avoid spurious influence of differing content distributions as the latent space is expected to comprise content and appearance ) . Most of these components are intractable and the paper provides approximations . Empirical investigation on two entirely synthetic and one real/synthetic data set provide evidence for the benefit of the method in closing the posed domain gaps as well as the quality of chosen approximations , the influence of the individual content and appearance gap terms , and the effectiveness of the optimization procedure . # # # Strengths : [ S1 ] The paper addresses a relevant problem : Learning from unlabeled data can be an important component in scaling vision systems to the real-world . [ S2 ] Claims , contributions and motivations are laid out clearly , evidenced empirically ( see W2 below , however ) and the writeup is well organized . [ S3 ] The presented empirical results demonstrate a significant improvement over the state of the art on a challenging problem . [ S4 ] The method is complex and there are several approximations , but they are largely motivated well and their impact is empirically investigated . # # # Weaknesses : [ W1 ] Although a good amount of detail is provided , due to the complexity of the optimization process , reproducibility of the method seems challenging . I consider this a minor weakness due to the complexity of the task itself . [ W2 ] Overall , the presented empirical evidence is somewhat limited in complexity : ( a ) type and number of modeled relations in scene graph , e.g . `` car '' is always subject for KITTI , ( b ) number of nodes types : car , pedestrian , vegetation , house . The authors do acknowledge this and put it in context . Nonetheless , it would strengthen the case for the paper if the authors could elaborate more on their expectations when encountering more challenging visual relationship data , either with more relations , more complex relations or more object types . What would be necessary to make the method work there ? What part of the method would need to be changed ? Would I need to add something to the model ? [ W3 ] I would like to see more discussion on the limits of the proposed approach : What are the expectations on fundamental limitations , e.g.computationally or in terms of representation ? # # # Further comments [ C1 ] I may have overlooked this : In table 6 I find it curious that the appearance and prediction discrepancy do not improve results for pedestrians , but only for the other three classes . Is this coincidence or are there speculations on why this is ? # # # Summary I believe that methods for efficient transfer learning from synthetic data can have significant impact in a variety of domains in computer vision . As a main weakness of the submission , the presented evidence is largely on toy data or very domain specific ( `` autonomous driving '' ) , however I do feel that there is sufficient contribution and insight .

It proposes an approach for closing the gap between simulated training data and real test data , to allow models trained purely on simulated data to be deployed on real images . The approach is tested on multiple environments , including transfer from a driving scene simulator to real KITTI scenes . # # Strengths - the problem of sim2real transfer is important , especially for training scene graph inference models , for which it is very expensive to obtain ground-truth scene graph supervision - the paper covers a wide range of related works on scene graph inference and domain adaptation - the approach is compared to a range of baseline approaches and improves performance on transfer to KITTI images - the paper ablates several components of the proposed approach and shows qualitative prediction results # # Weaknesses - * * unclear writing * * : the writing of introduction and approach section does not clearly express the novel idea presented in the paper . After reading over the paper multiple times , I now understand that the main novelty lies in the usage of pseudo-statistics of the target domain to adjust the source domain data distribution , which is possible since the paper is looking at * sim2real transfer * as a special case of domain transfer in which we have full control of the source domain . In contrast , most of the derivation in section 2.2 was already presented in Wu et al.2019 , except that they assumed to have no control over the label distribution ( since they assumed the general domain transfer setting where the source data distribution is fixed too ) . Based on this , I think the main contribution of the paper should be explained much more clearly ( see suggestions below ) . - * * unclear focus * * : the paper claims two seemingly orthogonal contributions : ( 1 ) applying sim2real transfer to the problem of scene graph inference and , ( 2 ) introducing an approach for modifying the training data distribution to better match the `` real '' test data distribution specifically for sim2real domain adaptation scenarios . Both problems are valid on their own ( even though ( 1 ) might not be a sufficient contribution by itself ) , but the paper fails to make a coherent argument why both should be jointly investigated . Focussing on one of the problems can improve the clarity of the paper . - * * training data alignment requires domain-specific knowledge * * : the core novelty proposed in the paper is the usage of pseudo-statistics to adjust the source data distribution . While the main paper remains unclear * how exactly * the pseudo-statistics are translated to a new training dataset , the appendix has more details that describe how the process is specifically adjusted to every domain . This domain-specific adjustment ( like randomly placing trees in the `` permittable '' region in the KITTI training scenes ) represents additional domain knowledge which conventional sim2real approaches do not require - * * baselines not explained in detail * * : the experimental section does not properly explain the features of the baselines that the approach is compared to . Without a more detailed explanation it is hard to follow the discussion in the `` Results '' paragraph of section 4.3 that discusses the worse baseline performance . Further , the mentioned dataset sizes in the experimental section are confusing since the proposed method is continually re-generating its synthetic training data which makes it unclear whether the comparison to baselines operating on a fixed dataset is fair . - * * no analysis experiments * * : the experimental section lacks experiments/visualizations that give a more detailed analysis of the novel part of the proposed algorithm . Specifically , it would be nice to see how the approaches changes the training data distribution over the course of training or to analyze the stability of the iterated procedure of training -- > data adjustment -- > training ... - * * details about derivation unclear * * : it seems that crucial parts of the derivation of equation ( 2 ) were moved to the appendix without referring to them in the text , which makes it very hard to understand section 2.2 , which is the core section for the proposed approach # # Questions - the reduction of the prediction discrepancy aims to reduce the gap between the predicted label distributions , but the approach is manually aligning these distributions ( by computing the pseudo-statistics ) , so training the model to accurately fit the training data label distribution should already minimize this discrepancy , so why do we need an additional loss for that ? ( it anyways seems to be only used in one out of the three experiments , why only there ? ) - the experimental section mentions fixed sizes for the used synthetic datasets , however , the proposed method is iteratively generating new data every epoch -- how is that accounted for in the dataset size ? do the baselines get access to comparable amounts of synthetic data ? # # Suggestions to improve the paper - determine a clear focus for the paper : the most coherent story would be to focus on domain adaptation for sim2real transfer using pseudo-label source content alignment , but then additional experiments on non-scene-graph-inference problems would be required to show that the method is generally applicable . - improve writing clarity by clearly mentioning how the investigated problem differentiates from the more general domain adaptation problem , then show ( best experimentally ) how usual domain adaptation methods struggle with the content gap between source and target environment and how the ability to modify the training distribution in the sim2real setting leads to the proposed method - expand on the explanation of the baselines ( +test them in all environments ) to make it clearer why they fail ( particularly since there is no reference work for the sim2real scene graph inference problem ) - add experiments that analyze the technically novel part of your paper , show how the training distribution changes over time to approach the target distribution - if possible , add a baseline that was trained with target , real image labels , particularly in KITTI environment , to show the performance gap of sim2real methods - the proposed approach seems like an EM-like procedure : compute pseudo-statistics with the current model + adjust synthetic training data distribution ( E-step ) , then train model on the new data ( M-step ) . Presenting it in this way could make the procedure clearer . It would also be good to discuss potential tradeoffs with prior work ( eg is the EM-like procedure prone to instability , do we need any additional assumptions like which quantities to compute pseudo-statistics over and which to ignore ? ) - the caption of table 2 does not mention for which dataset the evaluation is performed ( it is mentioned in the text , but it would be good to add it to the caption too ) # # Overall Recommendation Overall , the lack of clarity in the paper 's writing makes it hard to clearly grasp the core problem and delta to prior work , but I believe that some major restructuring and a few additional analysis experiments can substantially improve the clarity and focus of the paper . In its current form it is not ready for acceptance .", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "* * * Unclear writing * * . We thank the reviewer for pointing out some ambiguities in expressing the novel idea of our approach . Sim2SG differs from other unsupervised domain adaptation methods [ 1,2,3 ] as it can modify the source distribution ( via self-learning based on pseudo-statistics to align with the target distribution ) with access to a synthetic data generator . We also outperform these domain adaptation baselines [ 1,2,3 ] as shown in Section 4.3 . We have added this to Section 1 . * * * Unclear focus * * . The focus of the paper is sim2real transfer for the scene graph generation task . However , Scene Graphs ( SGs ) do not work well with synthetic data simulators [ 4 ] because of domain gap . We explain this problem in Section 1 ( paragraph 3 ) . Hence we propose to minimize the label ( ground truth ) , prediction and appearance discrepancies between the two domains using pseudo-statistic based self-learning and adversarial techniques . ( Section 1 , fourth and fifth paragraph ) . The two contributions that you mention are not orthogonal since we propose the second contribution as a way to solve the first contribution . * * * Domain-specific knowledge for training * * . We assume access to domain specific simulators to generate synthetic data whose labels are aligned with real data . These simulators can be unstructured ( this is the case for CLEVR , Dining-Sim ) or structured/realistic ( Driving-Sim ) . While access to structured/realistic simulators [ 4,5,6 ] may lead to better context ( road , Sky , sidewalk , etc ) and performance , we have shown that Sim2SG works well with unstructured simulators ( Dining-Sim ) as well . The fact that we tried more or less realistic generators in diverse contexts can be seen as an ablation study of our approach . * * * Baselines * * . We have added a functional description of the baselines in the second paragraph of Section 4.3 . The hyperparameters are mentioned in Section A.2.3 . The final numbers reported in Table 3 from Sim2SG are on fixed data obtained after 3 epochs of label alignment as well . This is similar to Meta-Sim that was also trained for several epochs to generate final fixed data of the same size . We use fixed data and exact same size for all other baselines as well . * * * Analysis Experiments * * . We thank the reviewer for this excellent suggestion . Next week , we will add a qualitative analysis of synthetic data towards label alignment as shown in Figure 10 . We will send a new message when the revised manuscript includes the suggested analysis . * * * Missing details of Equation 2 * * . We moved the derivation from Appendix to Equation 2 in the revised version . * * * Analogy to EM-like procedure * * . We thank the reviewer for this suggestion . Our approach is indeed similar to EM in the sense that the model parameters of the SG generator are exploited to improve the parameters of the discriminator and vice versa . We have added a line to illustrate the analogy in Section 2.2.1 . * * * Additional loss for label discrepancy * * . Label discrepancy is one of the three discrepancies that we address in Sim2SG . Even though we do not minimize the label discrepancy directly , it represents a bound and helps to automatically align the label distribution ( via pseudo statistic and synthetic generator ) . Sim2SG shows improvement over baselines using this term and without it , appearance and label alignment fail to improve the performance ( ablation in Section 4.3 ) . * * * Oracle performance on KITTI * * . We do not have access to all the labels in KITTI , so we can not report the oracle performance . However we have added the oracle performance for Dining Sim environment in Section 4.2 References : [ 1 ] Yuhua Chen , Wen Li , Christos Sakaridis , Dengxin Dai , and Luc Van Gool .

It would help to add another sentences describing it . - I enjoyed reading the discussion provided in Sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 . - Currently , the work does not discuss any limitations . As is , it is not clear in which situations the method fails . I would encourage the authors to add a discussion on failure cases to the final version of the paper . - I would suggest to tone-down the statements on claiming that scene graph labels in sim are mostly free .

Scene graphs are extracted in a two-step process , mapping input to an intermediate latent space and generating the final prediction from the latent space . The authors decompose the content gap into two components : ( a ) label discrepancy , i.e.how much do the label distributions between the two domains differ , and ( b ) prediction discrepancy , i.e.the difference in distributions of outputs predicted from the latent space for the two domains . They further model the appearance gap by aligning the latent representation for both domains after accounting for the content gap ( to avoid spurious influence of differing content distributions as the latent space is expected to comprise content and appearance ) . Most of these components are intractable and the paper provides approximations . Empirical investigation on two entirely synthetic and one real/synthetic data set provide evidence for the benefit of the method in closing the posed domain gaps as well as the quality of chosen approximations , the influence of the individual content and appearance gap terms , and the effectiveness of the optimization procedure . # # # Strengths : [ S1 ] The paper addresses a relevant problem : Learning from unlabeled data can be an important component in scaling vision systems to the real-world . [ S2 ] Claims , contributions and motivations are laid out clearly , evidenced empirically ( see W2 below , however ) and the writeup is well organized .

I consider this a minor weakness due to the complexity of the task itself . [ W2 ] Overall , the presented empirical evidence is somewhat limited in complexity : ( a ) type and number of modeled relations in scene graph , e.g . `` car '' is always subject for KITTI , ( b ) number of nodes types : car , pedestrian , vegetation , house . The authors do acknowledge this and put it in context . Nonetheless , it would strengthen the case for the paper if the authors could elaborate more on their expectations when encountering more challenging visual relationship data , either with more relations , more complex relations or more object types . What would be necessary to make the method work there ? What part of the method would need to be changed ? Would I need to add something to the model ?

Is this coincidence or are there speculations on why this is ? # # # Summary I believe that methods for efficient transfer learning from synthetic data can have significant impact in a variety of domains in computer vision . As a main weakness of the submission , the presented evidence is largely on toy data or very domain specific ( `` autonomous driving '' ) , however I do feel that there is sufficient contribution and insight .

It proposes an approach for closing the gap between simulated training data and real test data , to allow models trained purely on simulated data to be deployed on real images . The approach is tested on multiple environments , including transfer from a driving scene simulator to real KITTI scenes . # # Strengths - the problem of sim2real transfer is important , especially for training scene graph inference models , for which it is very expensive to obtain ground-truth scene graph supervision - the paper covers a wide range of related works on scene graph inference and domain adaptation - the approach is compared to a range of baseline approaches and improves performance on transfer to KITTI images - the paper ablates several components of the proposed approach and shows qualitative prediction results # # Weaknesses - * * unclear writing * * : the writing of introduction and approach section does not clearly express the novel idea presented in the paper . After reading over the paper multiple times , I now understand that the main novelty lies in the usage of pseudo-statistics of the target domain to adjust the source domain data distribution , which is possible since the paper is looking at * sim2real transfer * as a special case of domain transfer in which we have full control of the source domain . In contrast , most of the derivation in section 2.2 was already presented in Wu et al.2019 , except that they assumed to have no control over the label distribution ( since they assumed the general domain transfer setting where the source data distribution is fixed too ) . Based on this , I think the main contribution of the paper should be explained much more clearly ( see suggestions below ) . - * * unclear focus * * : the paper claims two seemingly orthogonal contributions : ( 1 ) applying sim2real transfer to the problem of scene graph inference and , ( 2 ) introducing an approach for modifying the training data distribution to better match the `` real '' test data distribution specifically for sim2real domain adaptation scenarios . Both problems are valid on their own ( even though ( 1 ) might not be a sufficient contribution by itself ) , but the paper fails to make a coherent argument why both should be jointly investigated . Focussing on one of the problems can improve the clarity of the paper . - * * training data alignment requires domain-specific knowledge * * : the core novelty proposed in the paper is the usage of pseudo-statistics to adjust the source data distribution . While the main paper remains unclear * how exactly * the pseudo-statistics are translated to a new training dataset , the appendix has more details that describe how the process is specifically adjusted to every domain . This domain-specific adjustment ( like randomly placing trees in the `` permittable '' region in the KITTI training scenes ) represents additional domain knowledge which conventional sim2real approaches do not require - * * baselines not explained in detail * * : the experimental section does not properly explain the features of the baselines that the approach is compared to . Without a more detailed explanation it is hard to follow the discussion in the `` Results '' paragraph of section 4.3 that discusses the worse baseline performance . Further , the mentioned dataset sizes in the experimental section are confusing since the proposed method is continually re-generating its synthetic training data which makes it unclear whether the comparison to baselines operating on a fixed dataset is fair . - * * no analysis experiments * * : the experimental section lacks experiments/visualizations that give a more detailed analysis of the novel part of the proposed algorithm . Specifically , it would be nice to see how the approaches changes the training data distribution over the course of training or to analyze the stability of the iterated procedure of training -- > data adjustment -- > training ... - * * details about derivation unclear * * : it seems that crucial parts of the derivation of equation ( 2 ) were moved to the appendix without referring to them in the text , which makes it very hard to understand section 2.2 , which is the core section for the proposed approach # # Questions - the reduction of the prediction discrepancy aims to reduce the gap between the predicted label distributions , but the approach is manually aligning these distributions ( by computing the pseudo-statistics ) , so training the model to accurately fit the training data label distribution should already minimize this discrepancy , so why do we need an additional loss for that ? ( it anyways seems to be only used in one out of the three experiments , why only there ? ) - the experimental section mentions fixed sizes for the used synthetic datasets , however , the proposed method is iteratively generating new data every epoch -- how is that accounted for in the dataset size ? do the baselines get access to comparable amounts of synthetic data ? # # Suggestions to improve the paper - determine a clear focus for the paper : the most coherent story would be to focus on domain adaptation for sim2real transfer using pseudo-label source content alignment , but then additional experiments on non-scene-graph-inference problems would be required to show that the method is generally applicable . - improve writing clarity by clearly mentioning how the investigated problem differentiates from the more general domain adaptation problem , then show ( best experimentally ) how usual domain adaptation methods struggle with the content gap between source and target environment and how the ability to modify the training distribution in the sim2real setting leads to the proposed method - expand on the explanation of the baselines ( +test them in all environments ) to make it clearer why they fail ( particularly since there is no reference work for the sim2real scene graph inference problem ) - add experiments that analyze the technically novel part of your paper , show how the training distribution changes over time to approach the target distribution - if possible , add a baseline that was trained with target , real image labels , particularly in KITTI environment , to show the performance gap of sim2real methods - the proposed approach seems like an EM-like procedure : compute pseudo-statistics with the current model + adjust synthetic training data distribution ( E-step ) , then train model on the new data ( M-step ) . Presenting it in this way could make the procedure clearer . It would also be good to discuss potential tradeoffs with prior work ( eg is the EM-like procedure prone to instability , do we need any additional assumptions like which quantities to compute pseudo-statistics over and which to ignore ? ) - the caption of table 2 does not mention for which dataset the evaluation is performed ( it is mentioned in the text , but it would be good to add it to the caption too ) # # Overall Recommendation Overall , the lack of clarity in the paper 's writing makes it hard to clearly grasp the core problem and delta to prior work , but I believe that some major restructuring and a few additional analysis experiments can substantially improve the clarity and focus of the paper . In its current form it is not ready for acceptance .", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "* * * Unclear writing * * . We thank the reviewer for pointing out some ambiguities in expressing the novel idea of our approach . Sim2SG differs from other unsupervised domain adaptation methods [ 1,2,3 ] as it can modify the source distribution ( via self-learning based on pseudo-statistics to align with the target distribution ) with access to a synthetic data generator . We also outperform these domain adaptation baselines [ 1,2,3 ] as shown in Section 4.3 . We have added this to Section 1 . * * * Unclear focus * * . The focus of the paper is sim2real transfer for the scene graph generation task . However , Scene Graphs ( SGs ) do not work well with synthetic data simulators [ 4 ] because of domain gap . We explain this problem in Section 1 ( paragraph 3 ) . Hence we propose to minimize the label ( ground truth ) , prediction and appearance discrepancies between the two domains using pseudo-statistic based self-learning and adversarial techniques . ( Section 1 , fourth and fifth paragraph ) . The two contributions that you mention are not orthogonal since we propose the second contribution as a way to solve the first contribution . * * * Domain-specific knowledge for training * * . We assume access to domain specific simulators to generate synthetic data whose labels are aligned with real data . These simulators can be unstructured ( this is the case for CLEVR , Dining-Sim ) or structured/realistic ( Driving-Sim ) . While access to structured/realistic simulators [ 4,5,6 ] may lead to better context ( road , Sky , sidewalk , etc ) and performance , we have shown that Sim2SG works well with unstructured simulators ( Dining-Sim ) as well . The fact that we tried more or less realistic generators in diverse contexts can be seen as an ablation study of our approach . * * * Baselines * * . We have added a functional description of the baselines in the second paragraph of Section 4.3 . The hyperparameters are mentioned in Section A.2.3 . The final numbers reported in Table 3 from Sim2SG are on fixed data obtained after 3 epochs of label alignment as well . This is similar to Meta-Sim that was also trained for several epochs to generate final fixed data of the same size . We use fixed data and exact same size for all other baselines as well . * * * Analysis Experiments * * . We thank the reviewer for this excellent suggestion . Next week , we will add a qualitative analysis of synthetic data towards label alignment as shown in Figure 10 . We will send a new message when the revised manuscript includes the suggested analysis . * * * Missing details of Equation 2 * * . We moved the derivation from Appendix to Equation 2 in the revised version . * * * Analogy to EM-like procedure * * . We thank the reviewer for this suggestion . Our approach is indeed similar to EM in the sense that the model parameters of the SG generator are exploited to improve the parameters of the discriminator and vice versa . We have added a line to illustrate the analogy in Section 2.2.1 . * * * Additional loss for label discrepancy * * . Label discrepancy is one of the three discrepancies that we address in Sim2SG . Even though we do not minimize the label discrepancy directly , it represents a bound and helps to automatically align the label distribution ( via pseudo statistic and synthetic generator ) . Sim2SG shows improvement over baselines using this term and without it , appearance and label alignment fail to improve the performance ( ablation in Section 4.3 ) . * * * Oracle performance on KITTI * * . We do not have access to all the labels in KITTI , so we can not report the oracle performance . However we have added the oracle performance for Dining Sim environment in Section 4.2 References : [ 1 ] Yuhua Chen , Wen Li , Christos Sakaridis , Dengxin Dai , and Luc Van Gool .
