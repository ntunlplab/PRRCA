We address your concerns one by one below : Intuition why the pretraining phase makes the training easier : - Encoder pretraining with a triplet loss learns an embedding space that models the distribution modes into clusters defined by the distance metric used for computing the triplet loss ( Figure 6-a shows clusters of similar styles and Figure 7 shows clusters of facial expressions ) . - During stage 2 , the latent space is kept fixed , and the input latent to the generator can be used to clearly distinguish the style cluster to which the output belongs , which makes the multi-modal synthesis task easier for the generator . It also helps avoid mode collapse when the variability in the output domain is not very obvious to the encoder during simultaneous training of G and E. We observed that BicycleGAN collapses to a single mode when training for the task of emotion transfer ( section A.4 ) , and also during some runs on the Maps dataset ( retraining BicycleGAN with a lower learning rate eventually worked for the Maps dataset ) . On the other hand , our approach is stable and we didn \u2019 t need to change any hyperparameters between different datasets , except for using a smaller network ( number of filters ) for small datasets like Labels2Facades and Night2day to avoid overfitting ) . - Results before finetuning ( Table 1 : \u201c ours - stage 2 \u201d row ) quantitatively show that pre-training alone ( without finetuning ) leads to reasonable results on-par with BicycleGAN , which proves the validity of our approach . - Stage 3 which finetunes both G and E together allows for tweaking the learned embedding to better suit the synthesis task , which reflects on further performance improvement in Table 1 . Figure 6-a and 6-b visualize the latent space before and after finetuning . The finetuned latent looks smoother and we observed that the covariance matrix after finetuning becomes more like a Gaussian . Intuition why pretraining generalizes across datasets : - Why Gram matrices ? The usage of Gram matrices for neural style transfer proved to be very effective and it reliably captures the style of arbitrary input style images . This implies that Gram matrices can reliably encode the styles from a wide range of domains , and they are not very specific to certain domains . - This led to our hypothesis that encoder pretraining using a style-based triplet loss would learn a generic style embedding that can generalize across multiple domains and be effective for multi-modal image I2I translation . We experimentally validated this hypothesis in Table 2 of the paper . - We however note that while style-based pretraining works well for many different domains where the output variability is mainly color and texture based ( for example the 6 datasets in Table 1 ) , it is not suitable when the domain variability is not color-based ( e.g. , facial expressions ) . But , we also show preliminary results for encoder pre-training using non-style metrics in section A.4 , which is able to achieve multi-modal image synthesis while the Bicycle-GAN baseliens collapse to a single mode . Why is this work useful to the community : - We believe that while end-to-end training poses a convenience , sometimes it can be advantageous both in terms of training stability and output quality for downstream tasks to break down the training into proxy tasks . We believe our work sheds some light on the usefulness of pre-training for image synthesis tasks , which aligns with the standard training paradigm in visual recognition of first pretraining on a proxy task , either large supervised datasets ( e.g. , ImageNet ) or unsupervised tasks and then fine-tuning ( transfer learning ) on the desired task . The current presentation of the paper lacks discussion : we agree that we detailed our approach and shortened the discussion due to space limit . We propose the following changes to make space for the discussion points mentioned in our response above ( we will submit a revision of the paper before the end-of-rebuttal period ) . - Move Table 4 about training speed and its corresponding paragraph to the supplementary materials - Move the details of the user study ( the paragraph before \u201c conclusion \u201d to the supplementary materials.- Make Figures smaller ( e.g. , figures 1 and 5 ) . Quantitative evaluation for how the training progresses compared to BicycleGAN : with toy or small datasets ( e.g.Labels2Facades ) , the problem becomes easy and the benefits of the proposed pre-training become less clear . We instead propose to include convergence analysis on one of the larger datasets ( e.g. , edges2handbags , edges2shoes or space needle ) where we observe that our approach learns to correctly match the style of output images both faster and more accurate than BicycleGAN . Specifically , we will report quantitative metrics ( e.g , LPIPS , L1 , PSNR ) over the validation set as the training progresses ."}, {"review_id": "rkgrbTNtDr-1", "review_text": "In this paper, the authors tackle the problem of multi-modal image-to-image translation by pre-training a style-based encoder. The style-based encoder is trained with a triplet loss that encourages similarity between images with similar styles and dissimilarity between images with different styles. The output of the encoder is a style embedding that helps differentiates different modes of image synthesis. When training the generator for image synthesis, the input combines an image in the source and a style embedding, and the loss is essentially the sum of image conditional GAN loss and perceptual loss. Additionally, the authors propose a mapping function to sample styles from a unit Gaussian distribution. I think the idea of pre-training a style-based encoder is straightforward. I am mainly concerned about the performance of the presented approach. First, there are no many visual comparisons in the paper. The only visual comparison is in Figure 8, but results are only limited to faces. The visual results in Figure 5 do not look appealing to me. The change in the style mainly comes from the global change in color: no much change in the texture or local color. The \"night2day\" results look poor to me. I am concerned about the diversity of the styles learned in the model. On the other hand, I am convinced that the proposed model is better than BicycleGAN, and the approach is somehow novel.

Firstly, a metric learning problem is solved to embed images into space, taking into account the pairwise style discrepancy (style is defined, e.g., based on VGG Gramians). As the notion of style is universal for similar datasets, this step further is shown to be generalizable. Secondly, the generator is trained on a supervised image translation tasks: the original image and the style, extracted from the target image, are fed to the generator, and the output is a translated image. Thirdly, style encoder and generator are simultaneously finetuned. Overall, this is an incremental work in the field of supervised I2I. Questions: 1. Is it true that the proposed approach requires semantically aligned datasets, as the style of the whole image is described with a comparatively low-dimensional vector, and the GAN objective is applied to paired outputs only? Compare, e.g., with Gramian-based style transfer, where segmentation masks are often desired for better results [1]. 2. Can the developed pipeline be generalized to the unsupervised setting, e.g., involving a cycle consistency loss and a non-conditional GAN objective? To my mind, such generalization can show the greater importance of the described method. Remarks: 1. Formula (1) is incorrect. I guess the first term should contain z instead of g.
