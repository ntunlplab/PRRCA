This is an important topic because analog devices allow fast and energy efficient inference, which is crucial for inference at the edge. Because of their analog nature such devices suffer from noisy computations, and in this article the case of noisy weights is studied. The main contributions of this article are the following: - an analysis of the performance loss in noisy networks by means of information theory and empirical results - the idea of combining noise injection during training with knowledge distillation - experimental evidence for a LeNet5 on MNIST, CIFAR10, and ResNet-50 on ImageNet It has been shown in the literature that noise injection during training is an effective way to increase the noise robustness of neural networks. Relevant literature in this domain is cited. The novelty of the approach is to combine noise injection with distillation, by using the noise-free network as a teacher for the noisy network, which is initialized with the weights of the teacher. This is a novel variant of distillation and sounds like a simple to implement trick with beneficial results for increasing noise resiliency of networks. It is also proposed and shown that the method works for quantized networks. The experimental results show that the combination of distillation and noise injection outperforms pure noise injection on all networks, as well as noisy inference without retraining. The effect is even more pronounced for quantized networks. * Evaluation * Overall I like this paper and think it is suitable to accept for ICLR, because it addresses an important practical problem of implementing deep networks on efficient hardware. The paper is well written and simple to understand and should be easy to implement (it would really help here providing code for the examples though). To the best of my knowledge I have not seen precisely this combination of noise injection and distillation, although there is a lot of literature about each individual approach. I appreciate that the authors made an effort to not just show empirical results but also motivate their findings by theory, although the argumentation stays a bit superficial. What I am mainly missing are two points: 1. The assumed noise model of i.i.D. Gaussian weights is the simplest possible, and might deviate quite a bit in actual analog hardware. I would have liked to see a noise model that is derived from actual hardware observations, or maybe even a prototype implementation in hardware, such as was done e.g. in Binas et al. 2016. At the very least I would suggest to test the model on other noise models, including temporally changing noise levels, which could be a realistic scenario due to temperature fluctuations or other events. 2. The experimental results focus on MNIST, CIFAR10, and later briefly on ImageNet. While the results are quite convincing on MNIST and CIFAR, these are easier datasets with usually well separable classes, so the effect of noisy inference might not be as pronounced, as in datasets with more confusion even in the clean case. In the case of ImageNet (Table 1) it looks like the difference to pure noise injection is not as big as it was in the CIFAR case, but here also only lower noise levels were tested. I would recommend testing also the same noise range as for CIFAR to understand whether distillation always shows the desired benefits, or if this is a diminishing effect for larger networks. Overall it would help to understand how the effect scales with network depth, e.g. by comparing the information loss for different ResNet depths. I'm giving weak accept and would change to accept if there could be clarification on how the approach scales to different network architectures and noise models closer to actual hardware. I also recommend publishing some example code for this approach.", "rating": "6: Weak Accept", "reply_text": "Author Response : Many thanks for taking the time to review our paper and the constructive comments .
