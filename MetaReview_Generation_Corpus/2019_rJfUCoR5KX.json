The empirical verification of the proposed hypothesis was viewed as weak as the only two datasets used are small datasets MNIST and CIFAR-10, and the used network architectures are also limited. Much more rigorous and thorough testing is required for an empirical paper which proposes new claims. Take the first claim \"end-to-end training of binary networks crucially relies on the optimiser taking advantage of second moment gradient estimates\" as an example. As it is known that choice of optimizer is highly dependent on the specific dataset and network structure, it is not convincing to jump to this conclusion using the observations on two small datasets and limited network architectures. E.g, many binarization papers use momentum for ImageNet dataset with residual networks. Does Adam also outperforms momentum in this case? Similarly, it is also hard for me to judge whether the other conclusions made about weight/gradient clipping, the momentum in batch normalization and learning rate, are correct or not. Some minor issues are: 1. In Figure 4, different methods are not run to convergence, and the comparison may not be fair. 2. The second paragraph in section 4: \"It can be seen that not clipping weights when learning rates are large can completely halt the optimisation (red curve in Figure 5).\" However, in figure 5, the red curve is \"Clipping gradients\", which one is correct? 3.

In particular, different existing training methods are tested and compared for training both MLPs and CNNs. The main findings of the paper are: - Using methods such as AdaGrad, AdaDelta, RMSProp and ADAM yields better performance than simpler momentum-based methods such as vanilla momentum and Nesterov momentum, which in turn are much better than vanilla SGD - When training binary models, it is common to clip weights and/or gradients for the proxy weights in the network. In the paper it is however shown that these methods hinder using a fast learning rate in the beginning of training, while the methods are required in later stages of training in order to achieve good results - Pre-training the model with full-precision training works well in speeding up training For a practitioner, the paper presents a very useful reference for what methods work well when training binary networks. Although there are some proposals and hypotheses for reasons behind the results, I see the paper as a review paper of existing methods for training binary networks, showing experiments where the methods are tested using the same benchmark and training procedure in order to give a fair comparison. As a practical guide, the paper therefore has clear value. What is lacking compared to typical ICLR papers is rigorously presenting new findings. The authors present a hypothesis for why different batch sizes are needed in the beginning compared to the end of training, but I found neither the justification nor the results very convincing with respect to the hypothesis. The way I see it, the actual novel proposals that are made in the paper are two two-stage training methods: one in which the tricks of weight and gradient clipping are only used towards the end of training, and one where the first stage of training is done using a full precision model. It is however quite well known that some training schemes with different stages can lead to improved performance: for instance with ADAM, even if it is an adaptive method, lowering the learning rate towards the end of training is often beneficial. It might therefore be fair to compare the methods to other multi-stage training methods. In addition, I could not find the training curves or final performance figures of the method where clipping is only activated towards the end of training. To put it all together, the paper is clearly useful for the community as it provides a useful summary of the performance of different methods for training binary neural networks. In addition, it presents two two-stage training schemes that seem to make training even faster. What the paper lacks is rigorous theoretical justifications and clearly novel ideas. Small comments: - How are the training lengths decided for the different methods? If I am not mistaken, in Figure 2, it seems like the SGD and momentum methods have not yet converged when training is halted. Is there a budget for wall clock time or is early stopping used or something similar? Considering the nature of the paper, I would see this kind of decisions as important to report. - In the abstract, you might want to refer to binary weights somewhere.
