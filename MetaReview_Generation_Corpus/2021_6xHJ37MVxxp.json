We also showed that MixStyle * largely * outperforms Mixup ( Zhang et al.ICLR \u2019 18 ) and its extension ManifoldMixup ( Verma et al.ICML \u2019 19 ) in the DG setting , as well as outperforming other general-purpose regularization methods . Compared with the two referenced works [ B , C ] , MixStyle is novel . Specifically , [ B ] tackles domain adaptation by modeling intermediate domains between source and target via a domainness factor and learning a CycleGAN model for image translation . This is very different from mixing the style statistics at the feature level done in MixStyle , which is much simpler in implementation . Furthermore , compared with L2A-OT ( Table 1 ) , which shares a similar spirit with [ B ] in terms of generating novel images at the pixel level , MixStyle achieves highly comparable performance , despite consuming much less computing resources . Therefore , we think it is worth sharing our idea of MixStyle to the DG community and to encourage more research in the direction of exploiting feature-level style statistics .
