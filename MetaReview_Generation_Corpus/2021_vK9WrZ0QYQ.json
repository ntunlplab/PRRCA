Here the authors provided the dot-product versions of these two kernels . Why do the authors need to do these changes ? For the sphere , the shift-invariant versions are equivalent to the dot-product kernels ? A : Yes , on the sphere , the shift-invariant kernels are dot product kernels . If $ k ( \\|x-y\\| ) $ is a shift-invariant kernel , then we have $ k ( \\|x-y\\| ) =k ( \\sqrt { \\|x-y\\|^2 } ) = k ( \\sqrt { \\|x\\|^2+\\|y\\|^2-2x^\\top y } ) = k ( \\sqrt { 2-2x^\\top y } ) $ .

A : Theorem 2.17 of Saitoh & Sawano ( the second reference in the parentheses ) states exactly Lemma 4 .

A : We are sorry for this confusion . The condition that $ x $ and $ y $ live on the unit sphere means $ x^ { \\top } x=y^ { \\top } y=1 $ . This can not imply $ x^ { \\top } y=1 $ . Actually $ x^ { \\top } y $ can be any real number in the interval $ [ -1,1 ] $ . We emphasized this in the footnote of Lemma 5 in our revision . Q : The second one is under Lemma 5 .

Both statements should be $ H_ { K_\\text { exp } ^ { \\gamma_2 , \\sigma_2 } } \\subseteq H_ { K_\\text { exp } ^ { \\gamma_1 , \\sigma_1 } } $ , which means a smaller $ \\gamma $ leads to a larger RKHS .

The superficial explanations can not help us understand this point . We need to go deeper into the proof sketch to figure out what makes this phenomenon happen . I did n't go much deeper into the Appendix , so it is hard for me to check the correctness of the whole paper . Since ICLR is a highly selective conference , I will give a score 5 at present . After the authors solved my concerns and other reviewers verifies the correctness of all proofs , I may raise my score to 6 or 7 .", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Thank you so much for your time and insightful feedback ! We have incorporated the changes into the revised paper , and address the issues in detail here : Q : In Section 2.1 , the original Laplace kernels and exponential power kernels are all classic shift-invariant kernels . Here the authors provided the dot-product versions of these two kernels . Why do the authors need to do these changes ? For the sphere , the shift-invariant versions are equivalent to the dot-product kernels ? A : Yes , on the sphere , the shift-invariant kernels are dot product kernels . If $ k ( \\|x-y\\| ) $ is a shift-invariant kernel , then we have $ k ( \\|x-y\\| ) =k ( \\sqrt { \\|x-y\\|^2 } ) = k ( \\sqrt { \\|x\\|^2+\\|y\\|^2-2x^\\top y } ) = k ( \\sqrt { 2-2x^\\top y } ) $ . We use $ \\|x\\|=\\|y\\|=1 $ ( $ x $ and $ y $ are on the sphere ) in the last equality . We can see that it is a function of $ x^\\top y $ and therefore a dot-product kernel . We expressed it as a dot-product kernel in order to analyze the decay rate of its power series coefficients and determine its RKHS . Q : Under Lemma 3 , if $ \\Sigma_k ( x , x ) =1 $ , we can only get $ \\Sigma_k ( u ) =\\Sigma_ { k-1 } ( u ) $ . A : Thank you for the great point . Plugging $ \\Sigma_k ( x , x ) =1 $ into Eq . ( 2 ) , we get $ \\Sigma_k ( u ) = \\kappa_1 ( \\Sigma_ { k-1 } ( u ) ) $ . By induction , we obtain $ \\Sigma_k ( u ) = \\kappa_1^ { ( k ) } ( u ) $ . We present a detailed derivation of Eq . ( 4 ) in Appendix A.2 . in the revision . Q : What does the notation $ \\kappa_1^ { ( k ) } $ means here ? A : Thank you for pointing it out . We define it right below Eq . ( 4 ) .It means the $ k $ -th iterated composition of $ \\kappa_1 ( u ) $ . For example , $ \\kappa_1^ { ( 0 ) } ( u ) =u $ , $ \\kappa_1^ { ( 1 ) } ( u ) =\\kappa_1 ( u ) $ and $ \\kappa_1^ { ( 2 ) } ( u ) = \\kappa_1 ( \\kappa_1 ( u ) ) $ . We clarified it in the revision . Q : Theorem 1 in ( Aronszajn , 1950 , p. 354 ) just stated that if $ K_1\\preccurlyeq K_2 $ , then $ \\mathcal { K } _1\\subseteq \\mathcal { K_2 } $ . I am very curious and doubting about Lemma 4 . For any positive constant $ \\gamma > 0 $ , does Lemma 4 always exist ? A : Theorem 2.17 of Saitoh & Sawano ( the second reference in the parentheses ) states exactly Lemma 4 . In fact , Aronszajn \u2019 s version is equivalent because $ \\gamma^2 \\mathcal { K } _2 $ has the same RKHS as $ \\mathcal { K } _2 $ ( the positive constant does not influence the RKHS ) . We cited ( Aronszajn 1950 ) because to the best of our knowledge , it is the original literature . Q : I can not find the original documents of ( Schoenberg , 1942 ) and ( Cheney and Light , 2009 ) . Could you please provide these results in the Appendix such that we can check the correctness of these results ? A : Thank you for the great point . In Lemma 5 in the revision , we restated these results from the original documents . Q : In Section 3 , I have two doubting points . The first one is under the definition of $ \\Delta $ -domain . The authors used $ z $ to replace $ u $ and $ u=x^ { \\top } y $ as shown Section 2.1 . If we put $ u=x^ { \\top } y=1 $ , the Laplace kernels and exponential power kernels given in Section 2.1 will all become constant . Could the authors explain more about this assumption ? A : We are sorry for this confusion . The condition that $ x $ and $ y $ live on the unit sphere means $ x^ { \\top } x=y^ { \\top } y=1 $ . This can not imply $ x^ { \\top } y=1 $ . Actually $ x^ { \\top } y $ can be any real number in the interval $ [ -1,1 ] $ . We emphasized this in the footnote of Lemma 5 in our revision . Q : The second one is under Lemma 5 . The authors stated that `` Careful singularity analysis then gives ... '' . It is very difficult for me to easily get these two results about Maclaurin coefficients . Could you give the detailed steps for the derivation of these results ? A : Thank you for your comments . In this section , we present an overview of our proof for Theorem 1 . Careful singularity analysis refers to Section 3.1 and Section 3.2 . The detailed proofs for Theorem 6 and 7 in Section 3.1 and 3.2 are referred to in the Appendix . We added some clarification before Section 3.1 in our revision . Q : In Theorem 2 , I am very curious about the seemingly contrary results : $ H_ { K_ { \\text { exp } } ^ { \\gamma_1 , \\sigma_1 } } \\left ( \\mathbb { S } ^ { d-1 } \\right ) \\subseteq H_ { K_ { \\text { exp } } ^ { \\gamma_2 , \\sigma_2 } } \\left ( \\mathbb { S } ^ { d-1 } \\right ) $ and $ H_ { K_ { \\mathrm { exp } } ^ { \\gamma_2 , \\sigma_2 } } \\left ( \\mathbb { R } ^ { d } \\right ) \\subseteq H_ { K_ { \\mathrm { exp } } ^ { \\gamma_1 , \\sigma_1 } } \\left ( \\mathbb { R } ^ { d } \\right ) . $ Could you provide more explanations about this point in Section 4 . The superficial explanations can not help us understand this point . We need to go deeper into the proof sketch to figure out what makes this phenomenon happen . A : We are sorry about this confusion . Thank you for pointing it out . This is a typo in our manuscript . Both statements should be $ H_ { K_\\text { exp } ^ { \\gamma_2 , \\sigma_2 } } \\subseteq H_ { K_\\text { exp } ^ { \\gamma_1 , \\sigma_1 } } $ , which means a smaller $ \\gamma $ leads to a larger RKHS . We corrected this in our revision . Thank you so much again for your detailed comments . If you have any further questions , please do not hesitate to comment ."}, "3": {"review_id": "vK9WrZ0QYQ-3", "review_text": "This paper compares the reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces ( RKHSes ) generated by a deep neural tangent kernel ( NTK ) , a Laplacian kernel , and an exponential power kernel . The main result is twofold : 1 ) the RKHSes associated with a NTK and a Laplacian kernel contain the same set of functions when restricted to the sphere S^ { d-1 } ; and 2 ) the RKHS generated by the exponential kernel with a smaller power contains more functions when restricted to the sphere S^ { d-1 } or R^d . The key proof idea involves an analysis the asymptotic rates of the Maclaurin coefficients of the kernels . Aronszajn \u2019 s lemma is then used to establish the inclusion of the RKHS . A notable contribution in the proof is the application of analytic combinatorics to obtain the asymptotic rate O ( n^ { -3/2 } ) of the Maclaurin coefficients of the NTK which is intractable due to its recursive definition . The authors also provide numerical results showing the empirical rate matches the theoretical asymptotic rate of the Maclaurin coefficients of the Laplace kernel and NTKs . Overall , I think the paper is well-written , and the proof is solid . The proof technique using analytic combinatorics seems novel , and the main results are useful for theoretical understanding of neural networks .", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "reply_text": "Thank you so much for your time , insightful feedback , and positive evaluation : - )"}}
