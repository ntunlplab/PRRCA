While static disentanglement learning has been an active centre of interest , disentanglement with dynamic or sequential data has been relatively under studied . Even less so in the WAE framework . It would be indeed interesting to see how to adapt our TCWAE to dynamical data . One objective when working with such data sets is to disentangle the time independent factor ( e.g.object class in video , speaker identity in speech ) from the dynamical content ( e.g.motion in a video , linguistic content in speech ) . One approach consists in building a generative model with two sets of ( independent ) latent variables , encoding independently the time dependent information and the the shared and static information respectively [ Yingzhen \\ & Mandt ] . How to adapt the TCWAE and especially how to handle the marginals constraints , could be the subject of future works . Very recently , Recurrent Wasserstein Autoencoder ( R-WAE ) [ Anonymous authors ] has been used to learn to disentangle sequential data in the WAE framework . The R-WAE objective possesses two latent regularization terms matching separately the aggregated posteriors of the time-invariant and the time-variant latent to their respective priors . An interesting point is the divergence function chosen by the authors . Indeed , while they propose a version of the R-WAE with the Jensen-Shannon divergence for the time-invariant latent regularization , they argue against a likelihood-based divergence ( with min-max optimisation ) for the time-variant posterior . This is justified by the fact that the corresponding prior is also dynamically learned , making the min-max optimisation of the divergence harder . It would be interesting to see if a sampled-base estimation of the KL divergence such as the MWS , would be more adapted to such distributions . * * References : * * * Yingzhen \\ & Mandt .

This combination certainly makes sense , as it brings together methods that have previously been shown to work well in isolation . The main part of the paper is devoted to an empirical evaluation of the new autoencoder training procedure .

We will amend the paper so that the experiments and figures , and in general the paper , is easier to read and understand in detail . For example , the latent traversals shown in Figure 2 are obtained after encoding a single observation and traversing each latent dimension at the time , with the traversal range $ [ -2 , 2 ] $ . The reconstruction are then plotted , each row corresponding to a unique latent traversal with the central column corresponding to the true reconstruction . We also understand the importance of hyper parameters choices and will make sure that the parameters selection process is better described in our work . In particular , $ \\beta $ is chosen such that the resulting method achieves the best overall score defined as the sum of the ranking on each individual metric : $ score = r_ { MSE } + \\sum_ { metric } r_ { metric } $ where $ r_ { MSE } $ designed the ranking of the MSE ( lower is better ) and $ r_ { metric } $ , for $ metric $ in \\ { MIG , FactorVAE , SAP\\ } , is the ranking of the disentanglement performances as measured by the given metric ( higher is better ) . In the ablation study , we focused on the impact of using different latent divergence functions in the WAE framework , and thus , by setting the hyper parameters to be the same , we can perform a rigorous comparison of the TCWAE objective with the original WAE . Indeed , when $ \\beta=\\gamma $ , TCWAE is simply a WAE with the KL divergence acting as the latent divergence function . Thus , in this setting , we are able to isolate the impact of the latent divergence function on the learning performance of the WAE without any disentanglement performance considerations . Choosing different values for those regularization weights allows for a fine tuning of the reconstruction-disentanglement trade-off . $ \\beta $ enforces a low Total Correlation in the aggregated posterior , constraining the aggregated posterior to factorize , resulting in better statistical independence of the latent marginals as discussed in Section 2 . $ \\gamma $ controls the level of marginal-wise regularization to the prior . One would think that its role in disentanglement should be minimal as it mostly prevents the latent codes to drifted away from the prior , resulting in poor generalization and samples generation performances . However , when using a factorized prior , it also implicitly contributes to the factorization of the aggregated posterior ( via the the product of its marginal ) . This is observed in the heat maps Figures 5 to 8 of the Appendix where for several data sets , $ \\gamma > 1 $ achieves better disentanglement . Overall , the impact of the different latent regularization terms does not differ much from the corresponding VAE-based methods , which should not come as a surprise . The only difference in the latent regularization lies in absence of index-code MI term in the TCWAE . However , its role in disentanglement remains to be seen [ Chen et al ] . Exploring its role in the WAE framework , for example by modifying our objective ( Equation ( 8 ) ) by simply adding an extra regularization term in the form of the index-code MI , could be the subject of future work . However , the resulting objective would only form an upper bound of the original WAE . Finally , while we acknowledge the not so impressive marginal improvements on toy data sets ( Section 4.1 ) , we would argue that this could simply come from to the nature of these data sets ( e.g.synthetic , black and white , grey-scale , low resolution ) , which makes such improvements hard to achieve . On more realistic data sets ( Section 4.2 ) however , the flexibility in the reconstruction term improves the reconstruction and generation performance . While disentanglement remains hard to quantitatively assess when the generative factors are unknown , we would argue that or methods present competitive disentanglement when compared with existing methods . * * References : * * * Chen et al.Isolating Sources of Disentanglement in VAEs .

Perhaps the authors could elaborate on that with an alternative objective close to the classical KL term , and thus easier to optimize ?", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We thank the reviewer for their comments and remarks . While we did not intend to present our work as a fundamentally new approach , the use of the Wasserstein distance for disentanglement learning has been relatively under studied . Indeed , the use of a KL-based divergence for the latent regularization of the WAE , exploiting its decomposition when using factorized distributions and the role of the resulting terms with respect to information encoding , has never been studied . Thus , in our opinion , while combining existing methods , our work carries a non-negligible level of novelty and relevance . We recognize that the performance improvements of our method do not represent a step change on toy data sets ( Section 4.1 ) . However , we would argue that this can be due to the nature of these data sets ( e.g.synthetic , black and white , grey-scale , low resolution ) , which make such improvements hard to achieve . On more realistic data sets ( Section 4.2 ) , we argue that our method achieves better reconstruction and generation performance while retaining visually competitive disentanglement as compared to existing methods . As discussed in the paper , this improvement in the trade-off can be explained by the added flexibility in the reconstruction term of the Wasserstein distance . As rightly suggested by the reviewer , the impact of the index-code MI term on the disentanglement performance remains to be seen . Future work could modify our objective ( Equation ( 8 ) ) to add an extra regularization term in the form of the index-code MI . However , the resulting objective would not provide the same theoretical guaranties than the WAE-based objective , especially in the limit of infinite latent regularization parameter in Equation ( 8 ) , we would not necessary cover the whole space of possible couplings . Finally , the use of the KL divergence for latent regularization , motivated by its decomposition and the fine tuning it enables on the level of statistical independence in the latents , is totally legitimate in the WAE framework as both the choice of reconstruction ground-cost and divergence function are at the discretion of the practitioner . Thus , the choice of the KL divergence as a latent regularizer provides the best of both flexible reconstruction cost with a theoretically founded latent regularizer . This is in contrast to the reviewer 's comment questioning the justification of using the KL divergence within the Wasserstein framework . On that point , we would like to highlight that the latent divergence function in our objective is indeed the standard KL divergence between the aggregated posterior and the prior . The resulting decomposition in Equation ( 8 ) simply unfolds from the use of factorised prior and encoder distribution Q ( Z|X ) . Thus our objective is indeed using the classical KL term but on different distributions than in the VAE-based methods . As mentioned previously , the difference boils down to the presence ( in VAE-based methods ) or absence ( in WAE-based methods ) of the index-code MI term . Adding this extra term in our objective would break the WAE approach but could indeed be the object of future work ."}, {"review_id": "vnlqCDH1b6n-3", "review_text": "This paper extends the Wasserstein Autoencoder ( WAE ) work by splitting the divergence on the variational marginal into 2 terms , akin to what was done in TC-VAE . This enables directly controlling the explicit contribution of the total correlation term , which is likely to contribute to disentanglement more directly . They explore 2 variations of their model , based on different estimators of the TC term ( TCWAE-MWS , using minibatch-weighted sampling ; TCWAE-GAN , using a density ratio trick ) . Overall , I found this work to be a nicely complete exploration of a simple extension of an existing framework . They mostly rederive existing methods in the WAE framework , but results are promising and the paper addresses several datasets , compares to baselines well and seems well executed . It seems to lack comparison and discussion to a paper which seems directly related [ Xiao et al 2019 ] . But I feel this is still a worthy piece of research to showcase at ICLR . Questions/comments : 1 . A cursory search indicated the following paper which also addresses disentanglement with the Wassertein Total Correlation : [ Xiao et al 2019 ] . They use another estimator of the TC , instead opting for the Kantorovich-Rubinstein formulation . 1.Can you comment on how their work relates to this current paper ? 2.A direct comparison would be rather interesting , but might be out of scope for a rebuttal . 2.Reconstructions for the TCWAE-MWS appear rather bad ( Figures 13-19 in the Appendix ) , but Figure 1c doesn \u2019 t seem to reflect that , which is slightly surprising . 1.Could you comment on this discrepancy ? 3.Relatedly the TCWAE-GAN disentanglement doesn \u2019 t seem particularly exciting ( metric-wise ) , would you still recommend using it instead of TCWAE-MWS ? 1.It is still a clear improvement over vanilla WAE , so there \u2019 s value to the work in this current state ; but I \u2019 d wonder when one would prefer choosing this versus TCVAE ? 4.It might be appropriate to discuss 2-Stage VAE [ Dai et al 2019 ] and associated family of models , which currently obtain really good results on more complex datasets .

Indeed , it is related to our work in the sense that both methods study the impact on disentanglement of the latent divergence function in the OT framework . While we use the KL divergence , motivated by the works of [ Hoffman \\ & Johnson , Chen et al ] and the information theoretic meaning of its decomposition , [ Xiao et al ] choose instead the 1-Wasserstein distance and , using the triangle inequality , obtain a similar latent regularization decomposition . Thus , the difference boils down to the divergence function : the KL divergence in our case and the 1-Wasserstein distance ( in practice WGAN ) in [ Xiao et al ] . [ Xiao et al ] motivate the use of the 1-Wasserstein distance by the introduction of the Wasserstein total correlation ( WTC ) . In this way , they avoid the difficulty of estimating the KL divergence in a mini-batch setting with intractable distribution ( i.e.the aggregated posterior ) . However , while still a correlation measure , the WTC lacks an information-theoretic interpretation such as the one offered by the TC , namely the loss of information when assuming independent marginals . Moreover , the computation of the 1-Wasserstein distance also comes with its own challenges , especially enforcing the Lipschitz constraint of the critic network remains an open research of area [ Arjovsky et al , Gulrajani et al ] . At a higher level , the objective of [ Xiao et al ] differs from the original WAE , since it resorts to the triangle inequality to obtain the latent regularization decomposition , thus only optimizing an upper bound of the original WAE . * * Clarification of our results and observations : * * When looking at the Figure 1c ) , the point corresponding to the NoisydSprites reconstruction plots Figure 13a ) in the Appendix is the one for which $ \\beta=\\gamma=2 $ . For those values , the reconstruction performances of TCWAE-MWS lag behind both WAE and TCWAE-GAN . This is partially reflected in the reconstruction plots . However , it is worth remembering that in the ablation study in Figure 1 ) , we fixed $ \\beta=\\gamma $ while for the remaining of the experiments we tuned both $ \\beta $ and $ \\gamma $ ( especially in the reconstruction plots Figures 13 ) to 19 ) , $ \\beta $ and $ \\gamma $ can be different with the chosen values given in Table 1 ) and Table 7 ) respectively . Globally , we observe that , across all data sets of Section 4.1 bar dSprites , TCWAE-GAN and FactorVAE achieve similar reconstruction performances while TCWAE-MWS performs similarly to TCVAE , with the former methods reconstructing better than the later . This can be seen in Table 1b ) , where TCWAE-GAN and FactorVAE achieve really close MSE scores , while TCWAE-MWS obtains MSE scores comparable to the ones of TCVAE . This is also reflected in the reconstruction plots . This is not really surprising when looking at the construction of the TCWAE objectives . As discussed in Section 4.2 , TCWAE allow for a more flexible reconstruction cost term as the choice of ground cost function is let to the practitioner . We believe that this added freedom allows our methods to present better reconstruction while retaining the same disentanglement performances than their VAE counterparts . This especially manifests when working with more complex data sets . This is indeed the case in the experiments of Section 4.2 , especially with CelebA , where TCWAE show better reconstructions and samples than their VAE counterparts when looking both at the MSE and FID scores . Quantitatively assessing the disentanglement performances remains an open question in the case of unknown generative factors , but the visual inspections of the latent traversals in Figure 4 ) shows competitive disentanglement performances of our method . * * References : * * * Xiao et al.https : //arxiv.org/abs/1912.12818 , 2019 . * Hoffman \\ & Johnson .

On this last point : It remains unclear to me whether the original hypothesis of the paper ( page 3 ) , that the index-code MI term of the KL divergence may be detrimental to disentanglement , is supported by the current study , and thus whether the extra technicalities required to eliminate it are worth the effort . Perhaps the authors could elaborate on that with an alternative objective close to the classical KL term , and thus easier to optimize ?", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We thank the reviewer for their comments and remarks . While we did not intend to present our work as a fundamentally new approach , the use of the Wasserstein distance for disentanglement learning has been relatively under studied . Indeed , the use of a KL-based divergence for the latent regularization of the WAE , exploiting its decomposition when using factorized distributions and the role of the resulting terms with respect to information encoding , has never been studied . Thus , in our opinion , while combining existing methods , our work carries a non-negligible level of novelty and relevance . We recognize that the performance improvements of our method do not represent a step change on toy data sets ( Section 4.1 ) . However , we would argue that this can be due to the nature of these data sets ( e.g.synthetic , black and white , grey-scale , low resolution ) , which make such improvements hard to achieve . On more realistic data sets ( Section 4.2 ) , we argue that our method achieves better reconstruction and generation performance while retaining visually competitive disentanglement as compared to existing methods . As discussed in the paper , this improvement in the trade-off can be explained by the added flexibility in the reconstruction term of the Wasserstein distance . As rightly suggested by the reviewer , the impact of the index-code MI term on the disentanglement performance remains to be seen . Future work could modify our objective ( Equation ( 8 ) ) to add an extra regularization term in the form of the index-code MI . However , the resulting objective would not provide the same theoretical guaranties than the WAE-based objective , especially in the limit of infinite latent regularization parameter in Equation ( 8 ) , we would not necessary cover the whole space of possible couplings . Finally , the use of the KL divergence for latent regularization , motivated by its decomposition and the fine tuning it enables on the level of statistical independence in the latents , is totally legitimate in the WAE framework as both the choice of reconstruction ground-cost and divergence function are at the discretion of the practitioner . Thus , the choice of the KL divergence as a latent regularizer provides the best of both flexible reconstruction cost with a theoretically founded latent regularizer . This is in contrast to the reviewer 's comment questioning the justification of using the KL divergence within the Wasserstein framework . On that point , we would like to highlight that the latent divergence function in our objective is indeed the standard KL divergence between the aggregated posterior and the prior . The resulting decomposition in Equation ( 8 ) simply unfolds from the use of factorised prior and encoder distribution Q ( Z|X ) . Thus our objective is indeed using the classical KL term but on different distributions than in the VAE-based methods . As mentioned previously , the difference boils down to the presence ( in VAE-based methods ) or absence ( in WAE-based methods ) of the index-code MI term . Adding this extra term in our objective would break the WAE approach but could indeed be the object of future work ."}, "3": {"review_id": "vnlqCDH1b6n-3", "review_text": "This paper extends the Wasserstein Autoencoder ( WAE ) work by splitting the divergence on the variational marginal into 2 terms , akin to what was done in TC-VAE . This enables directly controlling the explicit contribution of the total correlation term , which is likely to contribute to disentanglement more directly . They explore 2 variations of their model , based on different estimators of the TC term ( TCWAE-MWS , using minibatch-weighted sampling ; TCWAE-GAN , using a density ratio trick ) . Overall , I found this work to be a nicely complete exploration of a simple extension of an existing framework . They mostly rederive existing methods in the WAE framework , but results are promising and the paper addresses several datasets , compares to baselines well and seems well executed . It seems to lack comparison and discussion to a paper which seems directly related [ Xiao et al 2019 ] . But I feel this is still a worthy piece of research to showcase at ICLR . Questions/comments : 1 . A cursory search indicated the following paper which also addresses disentanglement with the Wassertein Total Correlation : [ Xiao et al 2019 ] . They use another estimator of the TC , instead opting for the Kantorovich-Rubinstein formulation . 1.Can you comment on how their work relates to this current paper ? 2.A direct comparison would be rather interesting , but might be out of scope for a rebuttal . 2.Reconstructions for the TCWAE-MWS appear rather bad ( Figures 13-19 in the Appendix ) , but Figure 1c doesn \u2019 t seem to reflect that , which is slightly surprising . 1.Could you comment on this discrepancy ? 3.Relatedly the TCWAE-GAN disentanglement doesn \u2019 t seem particularly exciting ( metric-wise ) , would you still recommend using it instead of TCWAE-MWS ? 1.It is still a clear improvement over vanilla WAE , so there \u2019 s value to the work in this current state ; but I \u2019 d wonder when one would prefer choosing this versus TCVAE ? 4.It might be appropriate to discuss 2-Stage VAE [ Dai et al 2019 ] and associated family of models , which currently obtain really good results on more complex datasets .

Indeed , it is related to our work in the sense that both methods study the impact on disentanglement of the latent divergence function in the OT framework . While we use the KL divergence , motivated by the works of [ Hoffman \\ & Johnson , Chen et al ] and the information theoretic meaning of its decomposition , [ Xiao et al ] choose instead the 1-Wasserstein distance and , using the triangle inequality , obtain a similar latent regularization decomposition . Thus , the difference boils down to the divergence function : the KL divergence in our case and the 1-Wasserstein distance ( in practice WGAN ) in [ Xiao et al ] . [ Xiao et al ] motivate the use of the 1-Wasserstein distance by the introduction of the Wasserstein total correlation ( WTC ) . In this way , they avoid the difficulty of estimating the KL divergence in a mini-batch setting with intractable distribution ( i.e.the aggregated posterior ) . However , while still a correlation measure , the WTC lacks an information-theoretic interpretation such as the one offered by the TC , namely the loss of information when assuming independent marginals . Moreover , the computation of the 1-Wasserstein distance also comes with its own challenges , especially enforcing the Lipschitz constraint of the critic network remains an open research of area [ Arjovsky et al , Gulrajani et al ] . At a higher level , the objective of [ Xiao et al ] differs from the original WAE , since it resorts to the triangle inequality to obtain the latent regularization decomposition , thus only optimizing an upper bound of the original WAE . * * Clarification of our results and observations : * * When looking at the Figure 1c ) , the point corresponding to the NoisydSprites reconstruction plots Figure 13a ) in the Appendix is the one for which $ \\beta=\\gamma=2 $ . For those values , the reconstruction performances of TCWAE-MWS lag behind both WAE and TCWAE-GAN . This is partially reflected in the reconstruction plots . However , it is worth remembering that in the ablation study in Figure 1 ) , we fixed $ \\beta=\\gamma $ while for the remaining of the experiments we tuned both $ \\beta $ and $ \\gamma $ ( especially in the reconstruction plots Figures 13 ) to 19 ) , $ \\beta $ and $ \\gamma $ can be different with the chosen values given in Table 1 ) and Table 7 ) respectively . Globally , we observe that , across all data sets of Section 4.1 bar dSprites , TCWAE-GAN and FactorVAE achieve similar reconstruction performances while TCWAE-MWS performs similarly to TCVAE , with the former methods reconstructing better than the later . This can be seen in Table 1b ) , where TCWAE-GAN and FactorVAE achieve really close MSE scores , while TCWAE-MWS obtains MSE scores comparable to the ones of TCVAE . This is also reflected in the reconstruction plots . This is not really surprising when looking at the construction of the TCWAE objectives . As discussed in Section 4.2 , TCWAE allow for a more flexible reconstruction cost term as the choice of ground cost function is let to the practitioner . We believe that this added freedom allows our methods to present better reconstruction while retaining the same disentanglement performances than their VAE counterparts . This especially manifests when working with more complex data sets . This is indeed the case in the experiments of Section 4.2 , especially with CelebA , where TCWAE show better reconstructions and samples than their VAE counterparts when looking both at the MSE and FID scores . Quantitatively assessing the disentanglement performances remains an open question in the case of unknown generative factors , but the visual inspections of the latent traversals in Figure 4 ) shows competitive disentanglement performances of our method . * * References : * * * Xiao et al.https : //arxiv.org/abs/1912.12818 , 2019 . * Hoffman \\ & Johnson .
