A more thorough ablation study is required . We performed an ablation study to understand each component \u2019 s contribution to the enhanced performance . First , in Table 1 , the newly proposed memory component brings 2.26 performance gain , where all models apply simplified RPE and we control the computation and memory cost . Second , having multi-task improves the performance slightly by 0.15 , but its main purpose is to avoid overfitting as shown in Figure 3 ( a ) . Finally , the relative position \u2019 s ablation study is shown in Table 2 , and we apply it to all the baseline models . Q : I feel that the memory size of 32 is unsatisfactory . The author should provide a plausible explanation about why increasing memory size larger than 32 is not helpful . To add , Lample et al.propose product key memory using 512^2 memory slots [ 2 ] . As shown in Figure 3 ( c ) , the performance does not increase much after the memory size is bigger than 32 . One reason might be because the average length of the document is 3,600 tokens , which is enough to cover with 32 memory slots . Also , we want to clarify that our memory is fundamentally different from Lample et al. \u2019 s memory . In their work , 512^2 memory slots are used statically as weights for the model to memorize the entire dataset \u2019 s information . However , our memory slots only need to dynamically compress the previous text information in a document , which is way much smaller . Q : The setting of the main experiment is not valid . Comparison of Transformer-XL and Compressive Transformer with Memformer by reducing memory size ( attention length ) is not fair because they are designed to capture long-term context . In Transformer XL and Compressive Transformer , the attention length including memory is up to 1,600 . Notice that the average length of Wikipedia articles is 3.6K tokens . The computation cost of self-attention is O ( n^2 ) . A large memory size would be very inefficient , and it is against the purpose of using memory to compress information . Q : The number of parameters in Table 1 is quite far from the values in the original Transformer-XL paper . We are using a smaller size Transformer XL . Due to limited computation resources , we set the number of layers to 12 , and the hidden size to 512 . Also , we use BPE with vocabulary size 50,265 instead of 267,735 in the original Transformer XL , which also contributes to a smaller number of parameters . Q : Could you provide details of speed measurement in Table 1 ? The speed is measured on how many text segments of size 64 are trained in a second . We tested on 4 Nvidia V100 16GB GPUs on GCP and the total training time is about 10 hours Q : Can we try a memory replacement policy like LRU ( Least Recently Used ) via a sparse update ? It is an interesting idea , but Transformer XL \u2019 s memory is based on previously computed tokens \u2019 hidden states . Replacing some of the tokens might cause structure inconsistency between the current computed hidden states and the memory hidden states . Also , as mentioned in Compressive Transformer Section 5.5 , older memories are not accessed less frequently ."}, {"review_id": "_adSMszz_g9-3", "review_text": "Summary : The paper presents a new model for the task of language modeling especially suited for longer sequences . This new model dubbed as Memformer consists of Transformer encoder-decoder and a memory module to store the past information from the encoder outputs . The encoder bidirectionally attends to the immediate previous sequence/segment information and to the memory module , which is designed to capture useful information from the past history of the full sequence . The idea is that by bidirectionally attending simultaneously to the previous input segment and to a memory module , the decoder should be able to improve its generation capabilities . Pros : The motivation of the proposed model is interesting , which is to bidirectionally encode the past segment information and a memory module to capture rich signals from the entire history . Cons : - The main drawback of this paper is the lack of controlled experiments in the results section . Due to this , fair comparisons to the previous language modeling results in the literature is not possible and thus merits of the approach are neither convincing nor clear . - To evaluate performance of the Memformer model , the authors present results on the Wikitext-103 dataset . However , to compare with the perplexity results from baseline models such as Transformer-XL and Compressive Transformer , the authors do n't include the results from the original papers and instead re-compute it under simplified settings . However , to report progress in a widely studied task such as language modeling , it is not fair to not compare against highly-cited state-of-the-art results . - In Section 3.1 , it is mentioned that byte-pair encodings are used to represent words . Are the perplexity results also computed over BPE tokens ? If so , then I feel this evaluation scheme is inconsistent with the standard language modeling evaluation of tokens which is done over words ( or linguistic units ) . - Although the results in Table 3.2 show that Memformer models obtains small performance gains in perplexity over baselines , but these results are rather marginal improvements and in the absence of statistical significance testing results , it ca n't be really understood if these are actual performance gains or due to randomness in the training process . - As the core of the experimental results are on Wikitext-103 , it is unclear if the experimental findings would generalize . Currently , the paper lacks comparisons on other datasets such as PG-19 from Compressive Transformers . - The authors propose a multi-task training approach for language modeling . However , the motivation and benefits of why doing this is actually needed is not clearly illustrated and the perplexity gains seem to be small . - In Section 2.1 , the motivation of simplified relative position encoding is not presented . - In paragraph 3 , it is mentioned that due to uni-directional attention is Transformer-XL style language models , the memory may not have enough capacity to retain important information . However , this does not necessarily holds true for different tasks . Can the authors include a more detailed explanation or cite a prior work that illustrates this phenomenon ? Writing Issues : - abstract 1st line : The mention of `` remarkable accomplishments '' is very vague in the context of applicability of Transformer models . - compatible with other self-supervised tasks : compatibility does not necessarily imply that such language models would be useful in self-supervised tasks . - Introduction section is not well-written . For example , the transition from first paragraph to second paragraph is rather abrupt , paragraph 3 : Transformers and its followers : this is a very informal writing style , something that is not really suited when submitting to a publication . - Sec 2.2.1 : The first sentence in third paragraph - `` Figure 1b is an assumed language model . '' is grammatically incorrect .", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "reply_text": "Q : The main drawback of this paper is the lack of controlled experiments in the results section . Due to this , fair comparisons to the previous language modeling results in the literature is not possible and thus merits of the approach are neither convincing nor clear . We tried our best to provide a complete and fair comparison of our model against other popular related models under the constraints of similar computation costs . We control many different hyperparameters such as the number of layers , vocabulary , batch size , learning rate , etc . to ensure fair comparisons , which requires more effort than simply reporting the results . But due to computation cost constraints , we weren \u2019 t able to run all models with their largest versions . One of the advantages of our model is being more efficient . Without a controlled setting , it would be unfair to compare efficiency . For example , in Table 1 , we show that our model with 76.21M parameters can defeat the Transformer XL with 80.35M . We also measure the speed and find that the Compressive Transformer is actually not very efficient compared to the Transformer XL . Also , In the original baselines papers , the reported results are based on a much larger memory size of 1,600 , which is not efficient as the attention cost is O ( n^2 ) . Thus , we shrink the memory size to a reasonable number . Moreover , we believe that only simply reporting results from the original papers without careful analysis would make an approach less convincing and clear . We contribute not only to our method but also the previous baselines by giving a detailed analysis of them . As Compressive Transformer has not released any code , we implement it carefully to ensure a fair comparison . We welcome people to test our implementation of the baselines . Q : In Section 3.1 , it is mentioned that byte-pair encodings are used to represent words . Are the perplexity results also computed over BPE tokens ? If so , then I feel this evaluation scheme is inconsistent with the standard language modeling evaluation of tokens which is done over words ( or linguistic units ) . Yes.In the original Transformer XL , the perplexity is directly computed from the final loss . However , since Transformer XL did not use BPE , some UNKs ( unknown token ) are also included . We believe that it makes the comparisons less convincing . Therefore , we apply the widely used BPE instead , and the setting is consistent in all experiments including baselines . Q : Although the results in Table 3.2 show that Memformer models obtains small performance gains in perplexity over baselines , but these results are rather marginal improvements and in the absence of statistical significance testing results , it ca n't be really understood if these are actual performance gains or due to randomness in the training process . In our experiment , we improved the results from 22.44 to 21.26 . In the original baselines , Transformer XL only improved from 18.7 to 18.3 , and Comprive Transformer improved from 18.1 to 17.1 . We believe that the perplexity difference is unlikely due to randomness . Also notice that we set dropout to 0.0 to eliminate randomness as much as possible . Q : The authors propose a multi-task training approach for language modeling . However , the motivation and benefits of why doing this is actually needed is not clearly illustrated and the perplexity gains seem to be small . As we have mentioned in the paper , perplexity gain is not the purpose of multi-task training . If you check Figure 3 ( a ) , we show that multi-task learning helps to stabilize the training to avoid overfitting . Q : In Section 2.1 , the motivation of simplified relative position encoding is not presented . Our model needs relative position encoding to ensure when doing text continuation , the input segment for the encoder can adjust to different lengths . Moreover , we find that the RPE in Transformer XL can be simplified to have better performance . Q : In paragraph 3 , it is mentioned that due to uni-directional attention is Transformer-XL style language models , the memory may not have enough capacity to retain important information A similar analysis can be found in T5 [ 1 ] Table 2 , where a unidirection language model only achieves 73.78 in GLUE , but an encoder-decoder can achieve 79.60 . The finding is similar to our claim that unidirectional attention is limited . We tested the memory module on a unidirectional language model , but the performance is bad .

A more thorough ablation study is required . We performed an ablation study to understand each component \u2019 s contribution to the enhanced performance . First , in Table 1 , the newly proposed memory component brings 2.26 performance gain , where all models apply simplified RPE and we control the computation and memory cost . Second , having multi-task improves the performance slightly by 0.15 , but its main purpose is to avoid overfitting as shown in Figure 3 ( a ) . Finally , the relative position \u2019 s ablation study is shown in Table 2 , and we apply it to all the baseline models . Q : I feel that the memory size of 32 is unsatisfactory . The author should provide a plausible explanation about why increasing memory size larger than 32 is not helpful . To add , Lample et al.propose product key memory using 512^2 memory slots [ 2 ] . As shown in Figure 3 ( c ) , the performance does not increase much after the memory size is bigger than 32 . One reason might be because the average length of the document is 3,600 tokens , which is enough to cover with 32 memory slots . Also , we want to clarify that our memory is fundamentally different from Lample et al. \u2019 s memory . In their work , 512^2 memory slots are used statically as weights for the model to memorize the entire dataset \u2019 s information . However , our memory slots only need to dynamically compress the previous text information in a document , which is way much smaller . Q : The setting of the main experiment is not valid . Comparison of Transformer-XL and Compressive Transformer with Memformer by reducing memory size ( attention length ) is not fair because they are designed to capture long-term context . In Transformer XL and Compressive Transformer , the attention length including memory is up to 1,600 . Notice that the average length of Wikipedia articles is 3.6K tokens . The computation cost of self-attention is O ( n^2 ) . A large memory size would be very inefficient , and it is against the purpose of using memory to compress information . Q : The number of parameters in Table 1 is quite far from the values in the original Transformer-XL paper . We are using a smaller size Transformer XL . Due to limited computation resources , we set the number of layers to 12 , and the hidden size to 512 . Also , we use BPE with vocabulary size 50,265 instead of 267,735 in the original Transformer XL , which also contributes to a smaller number of parameters . Q : Could you provide details of speed measurement in Table 1 ? The speed is measured on how many text segments of size 64 are trained in a second . We tested on 4 Nvidia V100 16GB GPUs on GCP and the total training time is about 10 hours Q : Can we try a memory replacement policy like LRU ( Least Recently Used ) via a sparse update ? It is an interesting idea , but Transformer XL \u2019 s memory is based on previously computed tokens \u2019 hidden states . Replacing some of the tokens might cause structure inconsistency between the current computed hidden states and the memory hidden states . Also , as mentioned in Compressive Transformer Section 5.5 , older memories are not accessed less frequently ."}, "3": {"review_id": "_adSMszz_g9-3", "review_text": "Summary : The paper presents a new model for the task of language modeling especially suited for longer sequences . This new model dubbed as Memformer consists of Transformer encoder-decoder and a memory module to store the past information from the encoder outputs . The encoder bidirectionally attends to the immediate previous sequence/segment information and to the memory module , which is designed to capture useful information from the past history of the full sequence . The idea is that by bidirectionally attending simultaneously to the previous input segment and to a memory module , the decoder should be able to improve its generation capabilities . Pros : The motivation of the proposed model is interesting , which is to bidirectionally encode the past segment information and a memory module to capture rich signals from the entire history . Cons : - The main drawback of this paper is the lack of controlled experiments in the results section . Due to this , fair comparisons to the previous language modeling results in the literature is not possible and thus merits of the approach are neither convincing nor clear . - To evaluate performance of the Memformer model , the authors present results on the Wikitext-103 dataset . However , to compare with the perplexity results from baseline models such as Transformer-XL and Compressive Transformer , the authors do n't include the results from the original papers and instead re-compute it under simplified settings . However , to report progress in a widely studied task such as language modeling , it is not fair to not compare against highly-cited state-of-the-art results . - In Section 3.1 , it is mentioned that byte-pair encodings are used to represent words . Are the perplexity results also computed over BPE tokens ? If so , then I feel this evaluation scheme is inconsistent with the standard language modeling evaluation of tokens which is done over words ( or linguistic units ) . - Although the results in Table 3.2 show that Memformer models obtains small performance gains in perplexity over baselines , but these results are rather marginal improvements and in the absence of statistical significance testing results , it ca n't be really understood if these are actual performance gains or due to randomness in the training process . - As the core of the experimental results are on Wikitext-103 , it is unclear if the experimental findings would generalize . Currently , the paper lacks comparisons on other datasets such as PG-19 from Compressive Transformers . - The authors propose a multi-task training approach for language modeling . However , the motivation and benefits of why doing this is actually needed is not clearly illustrated and the perplexity gains seem to be small . - In Section 2.1 , the motivation of simplified relative position encoding is not presented . - In paragraph 3 , it is mentioned that due to uni-directional attention is Transformer-XL style language models , the memory may not have enough capacity to retain important information . However , this does not necessarily holds true for different tasks . Can the authors include a more detailed explanation or cite a prior work that illustrates this phenomenon ? Writing Issues : - abstract 1st line : The mention of `` remarkable accomplishments '' is very vague in the context of applicability of Transformer models . - compatible with other self-supervised tasks : compatibility does not necessarily imply that such language models would be useful in self-supervised tasks . - Introduction section is not well-written . For example , the transition from first paragraph to second paragraph is rather abrupt , paragraph 3 : Transformers and its followers : this is a very informal writing style , something that is not really suited when submitting to a publication . - Sec 2.2.1 : The first sentence in third paragraph - `` Figure 1b is an assumed language model . '' is grammatically incorrect .", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "reply_text": "Q : The main drawback of this paper is the lack of controlled experiments in the results section . Due to this , fair comparisons to the previous language modeling results in the literature is not possible and thus merits of the approach are neither convincing nor clear . We tried our best to provide a complete and fair comparison of our model against other popular related models under the constraints of similar computation costs . We control many different hyperparameters such as the number of layers , vocabulary , batch size , learning rate , etc . to ensure fair comparisons , which requires more effort than simply reporting the results . But due to computation cost constraints , we weren \u2019 t able to run all models with their largest versions . One of the advantages of our model is being more efficient . Without a controlled setting , it would be unfair to compare efficiency . For example , in Table 1 , we show that our model with 76.21M parameters can defeat the Transformer XL with 80.35M . We also measure the speed and find that the Compressive Transformer is actually not very efficient compared to the Transformer XL . Also , In the original baselines papers , the reported results are based on a much larger memory size of 1,600 , which is not efficient as the attention cost is O ( n^2 ) . Thus , we shrink the memory size to a reasonable number . Moreover , we believe that only simply reporting results from the original papers without careful analysis would make an approach less convincing and clear . We contribute not only to our method but also the previous baselines by giving a detailed analysis of them . As Compressive Transformer has not released any code , we implement it carefully to ensure a fair comparison . We welcome people to test our implementation of the baselines . Q : In Section 3.1 , it is mentioned that byte-pair encodings are used to represent words . Are the perplexity results also computed over BPE tokens ? If so , then I feel this evaluation scheme is inconsistent with the standard language modeling evaluation of tokens which is done over words ( or linguistic units ) . Yes.In the original Transformer XL , the perplexity is directly computed from the final loss . However , since Transformer XL did not use BPE , some UNKs ( unknown token ) are also included . We believe that it makes the comparisons less convincing . Therefore , we apply the widely used BPE instead , and the setting is consistent in all experiments including baselines . Q : Although the results in Table 3.2 show that Memformer models obtains small performance gains in perplexity over baselines , but these results are rather marginal improvements and in the absence of statistical significance testing results , it ca n't be really understood if these are actual performance gains or due to randomness in the training process . In our experiment , we improved the results from 22.44 to 21.26 . In the original baselines , Transformer XL only improved from 18.7 to 18.3 , and Comprive Transformer improved from 18.1 to 17.1 . We believe that the perplexity difference is unlikely due to randomness . Also notice that we set dropout to 0.0 to eliminate randomness as much as possible . Q : The authors propose a multi-task training approach for language modeling . However , the motivation and benefits of why doing this is actually needed is not clearly illustrated and the perplexity gains seem to be small . As we have mentioned in the paper , perplexity gain is not the purpose of multi-task training . If you check Figure 3 ( a ) , we show that multi-task learning helps to stabilize the training to avoid overfitting . Q : In Section 2.1 , the motivation of simplified relative position encoding is not presented . Our model needs relative position encoding to ensure when doing text continuation , the input segment for the encoder can adjust to different lengths . Moreover , we find that the RPE in Transformer XL can be simplified to have better performance . Q : In paragraph 3 , it is mentioned that due to uni-directional attention is Transformer-XL style language models , the memory may not have enough capacity to retain important information A similar analysis can be found in T5 [ 1 ] Table 2 , where a unidirection language model only achieves 73.78 in GLUE , but an encoder-decoder can achieve 79.60 . The finding is similar to our claim that unidirectional attention is limited . We tested the memory module on a unidirectional language model , but the performance is bad .
