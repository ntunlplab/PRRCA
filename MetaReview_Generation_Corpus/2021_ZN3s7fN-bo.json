This article contributes a framework and tool for visualising data collected from a policy during RL training . It also contributes a set of views for visualising RL training data that could be used in general . Finally , the paper contributes a high-level workflow and a set of example use cases for how this tool might impact debugging a training session . 2.Strengths a . Problem Motivation i . The visualisation process for debugging/understanding RL training is certainly different from supervised learning use case . There is a need for a general tool to perform debugging on RL-trained models . This could be partially satisfied using visualisation methods based on the samples collected during training . b.Clarity i . The article provides a supplementary link in the main manuscript to an anonymised demo of the tool on ( potentially ) simulated data . This really helps understand the use of the tool by interacting with it . This was particularly helpful to understand the descriptions in the static manuscript . ii.The article also used figures effectively providing a clear understanding of each type of viewport described . c. Technical Approach i . The usage of simple visual effects to guide the user 's attention and `` nudge '' them is useful . 3.Weaknesses a. Anonymisation Failure in References i . A reference uncited in the manuscript body contains a non-anonymised set of author names to a paper with the same title as the system presented in this paper . This was not detected during initial review . `` Shuby Deshpande and Jeff Schneider . Vizarel : A System to Help Better Understand RL Agents.arXiv:2007.05577 . '' b.Citations i . There is egregiously missing information in almost all citations . This is quite obvious in all the missing dates in the manuscript text . c. Clarity i . There are a few unclear or misleadingly worded statements made as below : 1 ) `` However , there is no corresponding set of tools for the reinforcement learning setting . '' - This is false . See references below ( also some in the submitted paper ) . 2 ) `` stronger feedback loop between the researcher and the agent '' - This is at least confusing . In any learning setting , there is a strong interaction loop between experimentation by the researcher and resulting outcomes for the trained model . 3 ) `` To the best of our knowledge , there do not exist visualization systems built for interpretable reinforcement learning that effectively address the broader goals we have identified '' - It is n't clear what these broader goals are that have been identified . Therefore it is n't possible to evaluate this claim . 4 ) `` For multi-dimensional action spaces , the viewport could be repurposed to display the variance of the action distribution , plot different projections of the action distribution , or use more sophisticated techniques ( Huber ) . '' - It would be clearer to actually state what the sophisticated techniques from Huber are here . ii.The framework could be clearer that it applies most directly as described on single agent RL . The same approach could be used with multi-agent RL but the observation state and visualisations around that get more confusing when there are multiple potentially different sets of observations . Is this not the case , please clarify ? d. Experimental rigour i . The paper does include 3 extremely brief examples of how the tool might be used . However , it does not include any experiments to suggest that this tool would actually improve the debugging process for training RL in a real user study . Not every paper requires a user study , however , the contributions proposed by this particular manuscript require validation at some level from actual RL users ( even a case study with some feedback from users would address this to some extent ) . e. Novelty in Related Work i . The manuscript contains references to several relevant publications that can be compared to the current work . However , the paper is also missing references to many related and relevant works in the space of debugging reinforcement learning using visualisations , especially with an eye towards explainable reinforcement learning .

It is recommended to use the TensorFlow whitepaper citation for TensorBoard ( https : //arxiv.org/abs/1603.04467 ) . This is the official response ( https : //github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/issues/3437 ) .", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "> 1 ) `` However , there is no corresponding set of tools for the reinforcement learning setting . '' - This is false . See references below ( also some in the submitted paper ) . We agree with the evaluation and have reworded this sentence to reflect more nuance . Our views are that the contribution here is not on any single technique to increase interpretability , but a whole suite of visualizations , built on an extensible platform to help researchers better design and debug RL agent policies . We \u2019 ve also added the suggested references to the related work section . > 2 ) `` stronger feedback loop between the researcher and the agent '' - This is at least confusing . In any learning setting , there is a strong interaction loop between experimentation by the researcher and resulting outcomes for the trained model . Yes , that \u2019 s a good observation . What we intended to claim here is that the interaction loop between researcher and agent is stronger and more direct in the case of RL compared to the supervised learning setting . The example offered of experimentation and observing resulting outcomes is true also in the case of RL but is one step \u201c meta \u201d to the original process . The process of an agent \u201c interacting \u201d with the environment and collecting data samples conditional on the quality of the current policy is more unique to the RL setup and could be more aptly compared to the active learning setting . We make this claim since we believe that there should exist tools specifically designed around this \u201c interactive \u201d framework . > 3 ) `` To the best of our knowledge , there do not exist visualization systems built for interpretable reinforcement learning that effectively address the broader goals we have identified '' - It is n't clear what these broader goals are that have been identified . Therefore it is n't possible to evaluate this claim . Yes , this is a valid critique . The broader goals weren \u2019 t explicitly stated , however , we intended to convey that using existing tools it is harder to answer questions of the nature we \u2019 ve stated : * How does the agent state-visitation distribution change as training progresses ? * What effect do noteworthy , influential states have on the policy ? * Are there repetitive patterns across space and time that result in the observed agent behavior ? > ii.The framework could be clearer that it applies most directly as described on single agent RL . The same approach could be used with multi-agent RL but the observation state and visualisations around that get more confusing when there are multiple potentially different sets of observations . Is this not the case , please clarify ? Yes , this is the case . The current system is designed with single agent RL in mind . For multi-agent systems , two possible extensions are : 1. store additional metadata to associate logs with specific agent IDs and then filter / visualize these 2. spawn multiple vizarel sessions to keep track of agents based on IDs ( if being logged ) We \u2019 ve attempted to rectify and work on the other suggestions raised , and have also fixed numerous minor errors both in the main text and in the references . > The paper does include 3 extremely brief examples of how the tool might be used .

For our own testing , we \u2019 ve been using stable-baselines3 , but the API is agnostic to the specific choice of the library .

We emphasize that Vizarel is not constrained to answering these specific questions , but rather can be used to facilitate interactive debugging .

The article provides a supplementary link in the main manuscript to an anonymised demo of the tool on ( potentially ) simulated data . This really helps understand the use of the tool by interacting with it . This was particularly helpful to understand the descriptions in the static manuscript . ii.The article also used figures effectively providing a clear understanding of each type of viewport described . c. Technical Approach i . The usage of simple visual effects to guide the user 's attention and `` nudge '' them is useful . 3.Weaknesses a. Anonymisation Failure in References i . A reference uncited in the manuscript body contains a non-anonymised set of author names to a paper with the same title as the system presented in this paper . This was not detected during initial review . `` Shuby Deshpande and Jeff Schneider . Vizarel : A System to Help Better Understand RL Agents.arXiv:2007.05577 . '' b.Citations i . There is egregiously missing information in almost all citations . This is quite obvious in all the missing dates in the manuscript text . c. Clarity i . There are a few unclear or misleadingly worded statements made as below : 1 ) `` However , there is no corresponding set of tools for the reinforcement learning setting . '' - This is false . See references below ( also some in the submitted paper ) . 2 ) `` stronger feedback loop between the researcher and the agent '' - This is at least confusing . In any learning setting , there is a strong interaction loop between experimentation by the researcher and resulting outcomes for the trained model . 3 ) `` To the best of our knowledge , there do not exist visualization systems built for interpretable reinforcement learning that effectively address the broader goals we have identified '' - It is n't clear what these broader goals are that have been identified . Therefore it is n't possible to evaluate this claim . 4 ) `` For multi-dimensional action spaces , the viewport could be repurposed to display the variance of the action distribution , plot different projections of the action distribution , or use more sophisticated techniques ( Huber ) . '' - It would be clearer to actually state what the sophisticated techniques from Huber are here . ii.The framework could be clearer that it applies most directly as described on single agent RL . The same approach could be used with multi-agent RL but the observation state and visualisations around that get more confusing when there are multiple potentially different sets of observations . Is this not the case , please clarify ? d. Experimental rigour i . The paper does include 3 extremely brief examples of how the tool might be used . However , it does not include any experiments to suggest that this tool would actually improve the debugging process for training RL in a real user study . Not every paper requires a user study , however , the contributions proposed by this particular manuscript require validation at some level from actual RL users ( even a case study with some feedback from users would address this to some extent ) . e. Novelty in Related Work i . The manuscript contains references to several relevant publications that can be compared to the current work . However , the paper is also missing references to many related and relevant works in the space of debugging reinforcement learning using visualisations , especially with an eye towards explainable reinforcement learning .

I recommend this paper for rejection as the degree of change needed to validate the contribution through a user study or other validation is likely not feasible in the time and space needed . However , the contribution is potentially valuable to RL , so with the inclusion of this missing evaluation and additions to related work/contextualisation of the contribution , I would consider increasing my score and changing my recommendation . 5.Minor Comments/Suggestions a . It is recommended to use the TensorFlow whitepaper citation for TensorBoard ( https : //arxiv.org/abs/1603.04467 ) . This is the official response ( https : //github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/issues/3437 ) .", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "> 1 ) `` However , there is no corresponding set of tools for the reinforcement learning setting . '' - This is false . See references below ( also some in the submitted paper ) . We agree with the evaluation and have reworded this sentence to reflect more nuance . Our views are that the contribution here is not on any single technique to increase interpretability , but a whole suite of visualizations , built on an extensible platform to help researchers better design and debug RL agent policies . We \u2019 ve also added the suggested references to the related work section . > 2 ) `` stronger feedback loop between the researcher and the agent '' - This is at least confusing . In any learning setting , there is a strong interaction loop between experimentation by the researcher and resulting outcomes for the trained model . Yes , that \u2019 s a good observation . What we intended to claim here is that the interaction loop between researcher and agent is stronger and more direct in the case of RL compared to the supervised learning setting . The example offered of experimentation and observing resulting outcomes is true also in the case of RL but is one step \u201c meta \u201d to the original process . The process of an agent \u201c interacting \u201d with the environment and collecting data samples conditional on the quality of the current policy is more unique to the RL setup and could be more aptly compared to the active learning setting . We make this claim since we believe that there should exist tools specifically designed around this \u201c interactive \u201d framework . > 3 ) `` To the best of our knowledge , there do not exist visualization systems built for interpretable reinforcement learning that effectively address the broader goals we have identified '' - It is n't clear what these broader goals are that have been identified . Therefore it is n't possible to evaluate this claim . Yes , this is a valid critique . The broader goals weren \u2019 t explicitly stated , however , we intended to convey that using existing tools it is harder to answer questions of the nature we \u2019 ve stated : * How does the agent state-visitation distribution change as training progresses ? * What effect do noteworthy , influential states have on the policy ? * Are there repetitive patterns across space and time that result in the observed agent behavior ? > ii.The framework could be clearer that it applies most directly as described on single agent RL . The same approach could be used with multi-agent RL but the observation state and visualisations around that get more confusing when there are multiple potentially different sets of observations . Is this not the case , please clarify ? Yes , this is the case . The current system is designed with single agent RL in mind . For multi-agent systems , two possible extensions are : 1. store additional metadata to associate logs with specific agent IDs and then filter / visualize these 2. spawn multiple vizarel sessions to keep track of agents based on IDs ( if being logged ) We \u2019 ve attempted to rectify and work on the other suggestions raised , and have also fixed numerous minor errors both in the main text and in the references . > The paper does include 3 extremely brief examples of how the tool might be used . However , it does not include any experiments to suggest that this tool would actually improve the debugging process for training RL in a real user study . Not every paper requires a user study , however , the contributions proposed by this particular manuscript require validation at some level from actual RL users ( even a case study with some feedback from users would address this to some extent ) . We \u2019 ve added a section to the appendix that has preliminary results from a user study we are currently running . In addition , we \u2019 ve added a section that shows a visualization of using this tool on a representative hard exploration task ( Montezuma \u2019 s Revenge ) . We will have more results from both the user study in the upcoming weeks , along with examples of more such use cases where this tool could be used . In addition to this , we \u2019 ve added a section on a basic set of performance measures . We have also added all of the suggested references to the related work ( Section 2 ) , made additional changes based on suggestions , and fixed the errors from the main text and in the references ."}, "3": {"review_id": "ZN3s7fN-bo-3", "review_text": "This paper is introducing a tool intended for analysing RL processes based on visual information , in order to help the researchers to understand what is happening with the agent environment interaction . The system has varied options for plotting useful information that researchers/engineers normally have to analyze for debugging , but additionally it allows the user to have interaction data in the plots and visualizations of the environments . - This kind of works are promising and have some valuable contribution in order to unify and standardize the tools in the community , so that the reproducibility is more straightforward , as it has been with some RL libraries , sets of environments , or even the libraries for deep learning . However , the paper is too much focused on the side of showing what can be visualized by the users interactively , and it is missing more technical information about it . I assume there will be manuals , readmes , or so , but some technical information about the implementation of the tool would make the paper more useful for the readers , otherwise , going through this paper will not be necessary at all once the repo of the tool is released along with its documentation ( making the published paper only useful for citing the use of the tool ) . - Does the tool bring a library of algorithms and environments ? or is it built to be compatible with any implementation ? If that is the case , what is the architecture of the system ? which helps the users to understand how to connect their code with the tool . Without this information , it is not possible for the users to extend its use to other applications . - Figures need to be more connected with text in the paragraphs , some are not mentioned and some are mentioned very far from its place . - In temporal views it could be also possible to visualize value functions , advantage functions , returns , and also the cost functions computed for training the models ( NNs ) . - In Section 4.1.2 it is mentioned `` This idea can easily be extended to agents with stochastic actions , where we could generate a viewport using histograms to visualize the change in action distribution over time '' , this indeed might be a better example rather than the one given in Figure 2 . - Also in Section 4.1.3 it is mentioned `` The viewports discussed so far can be combined to provide the user more insight into the correspondence between states ( stateviewport ) , actions ( action viewport ) , and the components of the reward function ( reward viewport ) that the agent is attempting to maximize . Such a visualization could help alert the researcher toreward hacking ( Amodei et al . ) and thus design reward functions that are immune to this problem . `` , a good example in a Figure would be very depicting . - Can this tool be used to interactively change settings while running learning processes ? e.g.graphically modifying reward functions , selecting regions of points in the replay buffer to be sampled more often or to be ignored , etc . - In section 4.2.1 it is mentioned `` We can instead visualize the data samples by transforming the points ( van der Maaten & Hinton , 2008 ) to a lower-dimensional representation . This technique helps visualize the distribution of samples in the replaybuffer , which is a visual representation of the replay buffer diversity '' . It would be good to add the name of the technique , not only the reference . - What does `` ask questions '' means in Section 4.2.2 , in the sentence : `` The distribution viewport ( Figure 4 ) complements the replay buffer viewport by allowing the user to select clusters of data samples and ask questions ...

However , we believe that the paper in its current form is structured to provide context as to how this tool differs from existing tools ( Section 1 & 2 ) , along with comments with context about potential use cases in the remaining sections . The tool is designed to be compatible with popular implementations of algorithms and environments . For our own testing , we \u2019 ve been using stable-baselines3 , but the API is agnostic to the specific choice of the library . We felt providing an architecture diagram wouldn \u2019 t provide as much insight into how the tool is used , and hence provided a workflow diagram instead . However , we are eager to release this along with the documentation if that would be helpful . We \u2019 ve expanded with more clarifications in the appendix as well about an ongoing user study , usage in alternate environments , and preliminary performance metrics . > Also in Section 4.1.3 it is mentioned `` The viewports discussed so far can be combined to provide the user more insight into the correspondence between states ( stateviewport ) , actions ( action viewport ) , and the components of the reward function ( reward viewport ) that the agent is attempting to maximize .

Yes , we agree , these could be interesting examples to visualize ! > Can this tool be used to interactively change settings while running learning processes ? e.g.graphically modifying reward functions , selecting regions of points in the replay buffer to be sampled more often or to be ignored , etc . Yes , it could be . However , we made the design choice to not implement this functionality at the moment due to state synchronization issues when making changes to live running agents . We found that it was simpler to operate over policy checkpoints for the purpose of visualizations . That said , we are currently working on this feature . > What does `` ask questions '' means in Section 4.2.2 , in the sentence : `` The distribution viewport ( Figure 4 ) complements the replay buffer viewport by allowing the user to select clusters of data samples and ask questions ... '' Users might ask questions like : * What is the distribution of actions the agent took for these groups of similar states ? * What is the distribution of rewards for the state action transitions ? * What is the overall diversity of states which the agent has visited ? We emphasize that Vizarel is not constrained to answering these specific questions , but rather can be used to facilitate interactive debugging . We have added this clarification to Section 4.2.2 . > It would be good to add some comments about computational performance and limitations . We have added a section to the appendix on preliminary performance metrics . Beyond this , we are in the process of designing a more comprehensive set of measures that might be useful , which we plan to release along with the tool . > Is it useful for doing experiments with real physical systems ? Yes , this definitely could be . However , one question would be whether the policy rollout mechanism for the physical system is robust enough , with safe auto reset capability . We have not tried this with an actual physical system , however , since all of our experiments have been with agents in simulated environments ."}}
