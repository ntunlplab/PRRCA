They propose to take a meta learning approach, in which a set of i.i.d. IRL tasks are provided to the learner and the learner aims to learn a strategy to quickly recover a good reward function for a new task that is assumed to be sampled from the same task distribution. Particularly, they adopt the gradient-based meta learning algorithm, MAML, and the maximal entropy (MaxEnt) IRL framework, and derive the required meta gradient expression for parameter update. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a synthetic grid-world problem, SpriteWorld. The experimental results suggest the proposed algorithm can learn to mimic the optimal policy under the true reward function that is unknown to the learner. Strengths: 1) The use of meta learning to improve sample efficiency of IRL is a good idea. 2) The combination of MAML and MaxEnt IRL is new to my knowledge. 3) Providing the gradient expression is useful, which is the main technical contribution of this paper. (But it needs to be corrected; see below.) 4) The paper is well motivated and clearly written \"in a high level\" (see below). Weakness: 1) The derivation of (5) assumes the problem is tabular, and the State-Visitations-Policy procedure assumes the dynamics/transition of the MDP is known. These two assumption are rather strong and therefore should be made explicitly in the problem definition in Section 3. 2) Equation (8) is WRONG. The direction of the derivation takes is correct, but the final expression is incorrect. This is mostly because of the careless use of notation in derivation on p 15 in the appendix (the last equation), in which the subscript i is missed for the second term. The correct expression of (8) should have a rightmost term in the form (\\partial_\\theta r_\\theta) D (\\partial_\\theta r_\\theta)^T, where D is a diagonal matrix that contains \\partial_{r_i} (\\E_{\\tau} [ \\mu_\\tau])_i and i is in 1,...,|S||A|. 3) Comparison with imitation learning and missing details of the experiments. a) The paper assumes the expert is produced by the MaxEnt model. In the experiments, it is unclear whether this is true or not, as the information about the demonstration and the true reward is not provided. b) While the experimental results suggest the algorithm can recover the similar performance to the optimal policy of the true reward function, whether this observation can generalize outside the current synthetic environment is unclear to me. In imitation learning, it is known that the expert policy is often sub-optimal, and therefore the goal in imitation learning is mostly only to achieve expert-level performance. Given this, the way this paper evaluate the performance is misleading and improper to me, which leads to an overstatement of the benefits of the algorithm. c) It would be interesting to compare the current approach with, e.g., the policy-based supervised learning approach to imitation learning (i.e. behavior cloning). 4) The rigorousness in technicality needs to be improved.

The primary insight here is that there exists a smaller set of unique tasks, the knowledge from which is transferable to new tasks and using these to learn an initial parametrized reward function improves the coverage for IRL. With experiments on the SpriteWorld synthetic data-set, the authors confirm this hypothesis and demonstrate performance benefits - showcasing better correlation with far fewer number of demonstrations. Pros: + The solution proposed here in novel - combining meta-learning on tasks to alleviate a key problem with IRL based approaches. The fact that this is motivated by the human-process of learning, which successfully leverages tranferability of knowledges across a group of basic tasks for any new (unseen) tasks, makes it quite interesting. + Unburdens the needs for extensive datasets for IRL based approach to be effective + To a large extent, circumvents the need of having to manually engineered features for learning IRL reward functions Cons: - Although the current formulation is novel, there is a close resemblance to other similar approaches - mainly, imitation learning. It would be good if the authors could contrast the differences between the proposed approach and approach based on imitation learning (with similar modifications). Imitation learning is only briefly mentioned in the related work (section-2), it would be helpful to elaborate on this. For instance, with Alg-1 other than the specific metric used in #3 (MaxEntIRLGrad), the rest seems close similar to what would be done with imitation learning? - One of main contributions is avoiding the need for hand-crafted features for the IRL reward function. However, even with the current approach, the sampling of the meta-learning training and testing tasks seem to be quite critical to the performance of the overall solution and It seems like this would require some degree of hand-tuning/picking. Can the authors comment on this and the sensitivity of the results to section of meta-learning tasks and rapid adaption? - The results are limited, with experiments using only the synthetic (seemingly quite simple) SpriteWorld data-set. Given the stated objective of this work to extend IRL to beyond simple cases, one would expect more results and with larger problems/data-sets. - Furthermore, given that this work primarily attempts to improve performance with using meta-learned reward function instead of default initialization - it might make sense to also compare with method such as Finn 2017, Ravi & Larochelle 2016. Minor questions/issues: > section1: Images are referred to as high dimensional observation spaces, can this be further clarified? > section3: it is not immediately obvious how to arrive at eqn.2.

We have addressed the clarifications requested by the reviewer and added comments regarding requested comparisons . \u201c there is a close resemblance to other similar approaches - mainly , imitation learning. \u201d Behavior cloning is a simple solution , but only tends to succeed with large amounts of data . This is due to the problem of compounding error due to covariate shift which has been studied in prior work ( e.g.Ross AISTATS 2010 , Ross 2011 ) . Learning reward functions that reason about outcomes , and prioritize entire trajectories over others , can mitigate this effect by avoiding per time-step fitting . The difference between these two approaches has been further discussed in prior work in the literature ( e.g.MacGlashan et al.2015 ) and IRL has been shown to be a better solution in settings where lots of data is not available ( e.g.Finn et al.2016 , Fu et al.2017 ) . \u201c Furthermore , given that this work primarily attempts to improve performance with using meta-learned reward function instead of default initialization - it might make sense to also compare with method such as Finn 2017 , Ravi & Larochelle 2016 \u201d Thank you for the suggestion . Neither Finn et al.2017 nor Ravi & Larochelle 2016 actually tackle the inverse reinforcement learning problem , so these methods are not directly applicable . Our method is an extension of Finn et al.2017 to the IRL setting . An extension of Ravi & Larochelle is likely also possible , but would itself constitute a novel method . We do compare to an alternative meta-learning approach based on recurrent models , which is somewhat similar to Duan et al.2017 ( see Figure 6 red line ) , and we find that our approach substantially outperforms this alternative method . \u201c The results are limited , with experiments using only the synthetic ( seemingly quite simple ) SpriteWorld data-set . Given the stated objective of this work to extend IRL to beyond simple cases , one would expect more results and with larger problems/data-sets \u201d The complexity of the experiments presented in the IRL literature are generally less complex than the RL literatures . Our experiments however are able to scale to high-dimensional image inputs , in contrast to many prior methods in IRL ( see below ) . The complexity of the experiments should be judged relative to the literature , rather than a different problem formulation . In the IRL literature , it is not uncommon to report results in domains which we summarize here : Ratliff et al.ICML '06 consider a discretized driving domain , Ziebart et al. , AAAI '08 considered a driver route modelling setting with roads featurized by 22 dimensional vectors , Hadfield-Menell et al.NIPS '16 considered a tabular domain and used a featurized state representation with dimensionality 3 or 10 , Hadfield-Menell et al.NIPS '17 considered 4 variants of a tabular domain with a featurized state representation of 50 dimensions , Malik et al.ICML '18 considered a tabular domain on the order of a 5 x 5 grid with 4 object classes and 4 objects . We also emphasize that our domain is more challenging than those in prior work as it requires scaling to high-dimensional observations spaces . \u201c Images are referred to as high dimensional observation spaces , can this be further clarified ? \u201d The observation spaces considered in recent prior IRL work typically operates on features spaces on the order of 10-50 dimensions ( e.g.Hadfield-Menell et al.NIPS \u2019 16 , Hadfield-Menell el al . NIPS \u2019 17 ) or tabular states ( e.g.Malik et al.ICML '18 ) . In contrast , our reward function is defined directed on image observations , which in the case of our 84 x 84=7056 images is much higher dimensional ."}, {"review_id": "SyeLno09Fm-2", "review_text": "The paper defines a new machine learning problem setup by applying the meta-learning concept to inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). The motivation behind this setup is that expert demonstrations are scarce, yet the reward functions of related tasks are highly correlated. Hence, there is plenty of transferrable knowledge across tasks. Strengths: -- * The proposed setup is indeed novel and very ecologically-valid, meaning meta-learning and IRL are natural counterparts for providing a remedy to an important problem. * The paper is well-written, technically sound, and provides a complete and to-the-point literature survey. The positioning of the novelty within literature is also accurate. Weaknesses: -- * The major weakness of the paper is that its hypothesis is not tested exhaustively enough to draw sound conclusions. The paper reports results only on the SpriteWorld data set, which is both synthetic and grid-based. Having acknowledged that the results reported on this single data set are very promising, I do not find this evidence sufficient to buy the proposed hypothesis. After all, IRL is meant mainly for real-world tasks where rewards are not easy to model. A single result on a simplified computer game does not shed much light on where an allegedly state-of-the-art model stands toward such an ambitious goal. I would at least like to see results on some manipulation tasks, say on half-cheetah, ant etc. * Combination of MaxEnt IRL and MAML is novel. That said, the paper combines them in the most straightforward way, which does not incur any complications that call for technical solution that can be counted as a contribution to science. Overall, I find the novelty of this work overly incremental and its impact potential very limited. * A minor issue regarding clarity. Equation 3 is not readable at all. The parameter \\phi and the loss \\mathcal{L}_{IRL} have not been introduced. This paper consists of a mixture of strong and weak aspects as detailed above. While the proposed idea is novel and the first results are very promising, I view this work to be at a too early stage to appear in ICLR proceedings as a full-scale paper.

However , we believe that this criticism is somewhat unfair : the tasks in our evaluation are comparable in complexity or more complex than prior work in IRL . IRL is a difficult problem , and almost all prior IRL papers employ tabular domains . Our domains have raw pixel observations for the reward , which makes them more complex . We summarize the evaluation domains in prior work here : Ratliff et al.ICML '06 consider a discretized driving domain , Ziebart et al. , AAAI '08 considered a driver route modelling setting with roads featurized by 22 dimensional vectors , Hadfield-Menell et al.NIPS '16 considered a tabular domain and used a featurized state representation with dimensionality 3 or 10 , Hadfield-Menell et al.NIPS '17 considered 4 variants of a tabular domain with a featurized state representation of 50 dimensions , Malik et al.ICML '18 considered a tabular domain on the order of a 5 x 5 grid with 4 object classes and 4 objects . Regardless of what experiments are presented , it is always the case that more experiments on more complex domains provides stronger evidence for an approach . From this perspective , an approach should provide results comparable to prior work in the literature . It is not uncommon for prior work in the IRL domain to demonstrate the benefits their approach in a single domain as demonstrated above . In addition , to our knowledge there is no prior work on the problem of meta-IRL . There is also no prior work demonstrating IRL on half-cheetah to the best of our knowledge .

It is easy to see that few-shot learning is one such example of this ."}, "1": {"review_id": "SyeLno09Fm-1", "review_text": "This paper attempts to the solve data-set coverage issue common with Inverse reinforcement learning based approaches - by introducing a meta-learning framework trained on a smaller number of basic tasks. The primary insight here is that there exists a smaller set of unique tasks, the knowledge from which is transferable to new tasks and using these to learn an initial parametrized reward function improves the coverage for IRL. With experiments on the SpriteWorld synthetic data-set, the authors confirm this hypothesis and demonstrate performance benefits - showcasing better correlation with far fewer number of demonstrations. Pros: + The solution proposed here in novel - combining meta-learning on tasks to alleviate a key problem with IRL based approaches. The fact that this is motivated by the human-process of learning, which successfully leverages tranferability of knowledges across a group of basic tasks for any new (unseen) tasks, makes it quite interesting. + Unburdens the needs for extensive datasets for IRL based approach to be effective + To a large extent, circumvents the need of having to manually engineered features for learning IRL reward functions Cons: - Although the current formulation is novel, there is a close resemblance to other similar approaches - mainly, imitation learning. It would be good if the authors could contrast the differences between the proposed approach and approach based on imitation learning (with similar modifications). Imitation learning is only briefly mentioned in the related work (section-2), it would be helpful to elaborate on this. For instance, with Alg-1 other than the specific metric used in #3 (MaxEntIRLGrad), the rest seems close similar to what would be done with imitation learning? - One of main contributions is avoiding the need for hand-crafted features for the IRL reward function. However, even with the current approach, the sampling of the meta-learning training and testing tasks seem to be quite critical to the performance of the overall solution and It seems like this would require some degree of hand-tuning/picking. Can the authors comment on this and the sensitivity of the results to section of meta-learning tasks and rapid adaption? - The results are limited, with experiments using only the synthetic (seemingly quite simple) SpriteWorld data-set. Given the stated objective of this work to extend IRL to beyond simple cases, one would expect more results and with larger problems/data-sets. - Furthermore, given that this work primarily attempts to improve performance with using meta-learned reward function instead of default initialization - it might make sense to also compare with method such as Finn 2017, Ravi & Larochelle 2016. Minor questions/issues: > section1: Images are referred to as high dimensional observation spaces, can this be further clarified? > section3: it is not immediately obvious how to arrive at eqn.2. Perhaps additional description would help. > section4.1 (MandRIL) meta-training: What is the impact/sensitivity of computing the state visitation distribution with either using the average of expert demos or the true reward? In the reported experiments, what is used and what is the impact on results, if any ? > section4.2: provides an interesting insight with the concept of locality of the prior and establishes the connection with Bayesian approaches. > With the results, it seems like that other approaches continue to improve on performance with increasing number of demonstrations (the far right part of the Fig.4, 5) whereas the proposed approach seems to stagnate - has this been experimented further ? does this have implications on the capacity of meta-learning ? > Overall, given that there are several knobs in the current algorithm, a comprehensive sensitivity study on the relative impact would help provide a more complete picutre", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "We thank the reviewer for their comments . We have addressed the clarifications requested by the reviewer and added comments regarding requested comparisons . \u201c there is a close resemblance to other similar approaches - mainly , imitation learning. \u201d Behavior cloning is a simple solution , but only tends to succeed with large amounts of data . This is due to the problem of compounding error due to covariate shift which has been studied in prior work ( e.g.Ross AISTATS 2010 , Ross 2011 ) . Learning reward functions that reason about outcomes , and prioritize entire trajectories over others , can mitigate this effect by avoiding per time-step fitting . The difference between these two approaches has been further discussed in prior work in the literature ( e.g.MacGlashan et al.2015 ) and IRL has been shown to be a better solution in settings where lots of data is not available ( e.g.Finn et al.2016 , Fu et al.2017 ) . \u201c Furthermore , given that this work primarily attempts to improve performance with using meta-learned reward function instead of default initialization - it might make sense to also compare with method such as Finn 2017 , Ravi & Larochelle 2016 \u201d Thank you for the suggestion . Neither Finn et al.2017 nor Ravi & Larochelle 2016 actually tackle the inverse reinforcement learning problem , so these methods are not directly applicable . Our method is an extension of Finn et al.2017 to the IRL setting . An extension of Ravi & Larochelle is likely also possible , but would itself constitute a novel method . We do compare to an alternative meta-learning approach based on recurrent models , which is somewhat similar to Duan et al.2017 ( see Figure 6 red line ) , and we find that our approach substantially outperforms this alternative method . \u201c The results are limited , with experiments using only the synthetic ( seemingly quite simple ) SpriteWorld data-set . Given the stated objective of this work to extend IRL to beyond simple cases , one would expect more results and with larger problems/data-sets \u201d The complexity of the experiments presented in the IRL literature are generally less complex than the RL literatures . Our experiments however are able to scale to high-dimensional image inputs , in contrast to many prior methods in IRL ( see below ) . The complexity of the experiments should be judged relative to the literature , rather than a different problem formulation . In the IRL literature , it is not uncommon to report results in domains which we summarize here : Ratliff et al.ICML '06 consider a discretized driving domain , Ziebart et al. , AAAI '08 considered a driver route modelling setting with roads featurized by 22 dimensional vectors , Hadfield-Menell et al.NIPS '16 considered a tabular domain and used a featurized state representation with dimensionality 3 or 10 , Hadfield-Menell et al.NIPS '17 considered 4 variants of a tabular domain with a featurized state representation of 50 dimensions , Malik et al.ICML '18 considered a tabular domain on the order of a 5 x 5 grid with 4 object classes and 4 objects . We also emphasize that our domain is more challenging than those in prior work as it requires scaling to high-dimensional observations spaces . \u201c Images are referred to as high dimensional observation spaces , can this be further clarified ? \u201d The observation spaces considered in recent prior IRL work typically operates on features spaces on the order of 10-50 dimensions ( e.g.Hadfield-Menell et al.NIPS \u2019 16 , Hadfield-Menell el al . NIPS \u2019 17 ) or tabular states ( e.g.Malik et al.ICML '18 ) . In contrast , our reward function is defined directed on image observations , which in the case of our 84 x 84=7056 images is much higher dimensional ."}, "2": {"review_id": "SyeLno09Fm-2", "review_text": "The paper defines a new machine learning problem setup by applying the meta-learning concept to inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). The motivation behind this setup is that expert demonstrations are scarce, yet the reward functions of related tasks are highly correlated. Hence, there is plenty of transferrable knowledge across tasks. Strengths: -- * The proposed setup is indeed novel and very ecologically-valid, meaning meta-learning and IRL are natural counterparts for providing a remedy to an important problem. * The paper is well-written, technically sound, and provides a complete and to-the-point literature survey. The positioning of the novelty within literature is also accurate. Weaknesses: -- * The major weakness of the paper is that its hypothesis is not tested exhaustively enough to draw sound conclusions. The paper reports results only on the SpriteWorld data set, which is both synthetic and grid-based. Having acknowledged that the results reported on this single data set are very promising, I do not find this evidence sufficient to buy the proposed hypothesis. After all, IRL is meant mainly for real-world tasks where rewards are not easy to model. A single result on a simplified computer game does not shed much light on where an allegedly state-of-the-art model stands toward such an ambitious goal. I would at least like to see results on some manipulation tasks, say on half-cheetah, ant etc. * Combination of MaxEnt IRL and MAML is novel. That said, the paper combines them in the most straightforward way, which does not incur any complications that call for technical solution that can be counted as a contribution to science. Overall, I find the novelty of this work overly incremental and its impact potential very limited. * A minor issue regarding clarity. Equation 3 is not readable at all. The parameter \\phi and the loss \\mathcal{L}_{IRL} have not been introduced. This paper consists of a mixture of strong and weak aspects as detailed above. While the proposed idea is novel and the first results are very promising, I view this work to be at a too early stage to appear in ICLR proceedings as a full-scale paper. I would like to encourage the authors to submit it to a workshop, strengthen its empirical side and resubmit to a future conference.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "Thanks for your review . We have addressed the clarifications requested by the reviewer and added clarifying comments on the additional domains required by the reviewers . \u201c The major weakness of the paper is that its hypothesis is not tested exhaustively enough to draw sound conclusions \u2026 A single result on a simplified computer game does not shed much light on where an allegedly state-of-the-art model stands toward such an ambitious goal . I would at least like to see results on some manipulation tasks , say on half-cheetah , ant etc . .. Combination of MaxEnt IRL and MAML is novel . That said , the paper combines them in the most straightforward way \u201d We appreciate the feedback . However , we believe that this criticism is somewhat unfair : the tasks in our evaluation are comparable in complexity or more complex than prior work in IRL . IRL is a difficult problem , and almost all prior IRL papers employ tabular domains . Our domains have raw pixel observations for the reward , which makes them more complex . We summarize the evaluation domains in prior work here : Ratliff et al.ICML '06 consider a discretized driving domain , Ziebart et al. , AAAI '08 considered a driver route modelling setting with roads featurized by 22 dimensional vectors , Hadfield-Menell et al.NIPS '16 considered a tabular domain and used a featurized state representation with dimensionality 3 or 10 , Hadfield-Menell et al.NIPS '17 considered 4 variants of a tabular domain with a featurized state representation of 50 dimensions , Malik et al.ICML '18 considered a tabular domain on the order of a 5 x 5 grid with 4 object classes and 4 objects . Regardless of what experiments are presented , it is always the case that more experiments on more complex domains provides stronger evidence for an approach . From this perspective , an approach should provide results comparable to prior work in the literature . It is not uncommon for prior work in the IRL domain to demonstrate the benefits their approach in a single domain as demonstrated above . In addition , to our knowledge there is no prior work on the problem of meta-IRL . There is also no prior work demonstrating IRL on half-cheetah to the best of our knowledge . The only example on Ant comes from ( Fu et al.2017 ) but this environment is not suited to generating a large diversity of tasks for meta-learning . \u201c The parameter \\phi and the loss \\mathcal { L } _ { IRL } have not been introduced. \u201d That equation was meant to provide the definition of the Max-Ent IRL loss .
