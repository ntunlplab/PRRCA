The proposed method uses advantages to as weight in regression, which is an extension of the known method of reward-weighted regression. The paper is in general nicely written, and it comes with a set of theoretical analyses and experiments. While all reviewers admit that the approach is interesting and the work makes an attempt to solve an important yet open problem, there are several aspects of the paper that make it not ready for publication in its current form:\n\n- Novelty: As pointed out by reviewers, the proposed method appears to be a minor modification of existing off-policy solvers. Although the use of advantages as weights makes intuitive sense, it is unclear why and how the new method significantly differs from and outperforms existing methods. Going forward, it would be helpful if the authors could present more convincing arguments/experiments to demonstrate the power of ARW, relative to similar existing methods.\n\n- Experiments provide some insights into the difference between several algorithms, but the results are not strong enough to support the claim of the paper. Please see reviewers' comments for more details. We strongly recommend the authors to take these comments into consideration and develop more rigorous experiments to demonstrate advantages of AWR.\n\n- Theoretical analysis is limited. As R#2, R#3 mentioned, the theory analysis in the paper seems to not match the algorithm, and there remain bugs, this it doesn't add to the paper. Although theory might not be the focus of the paper, if the authors decide into include theoretical analysis, the analysis would hopefully provide insights into why and by how much the approach is better.\n\n", "reviews": [{"review_id": "ToWi1RjuEr8-0", "review_text": "This study presents a deep reinforcement learning method , Advantage-Weighted Regression ( AWR ) . The policy update of AWR is constrained as in a similar manner as REPS ( Peters et al. , 2010 ) . Although the benefit of AWR is not clear in the reinforcement learning tasks , AWR exhibits its advantages in the context of imitation learning and off-policy learning with static datasets . The paper is well-organized and easy to follow . However , there are some unclear points . I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points . My main concern is the novelty of the method because the difference between MPO and AWR is not clear to me . In my understanding , both MPO and AWR solve the same optimization problem to satisfy the KL divergence constraint , and both MPO and AWR update the policy by maximizing the weighted log-likelihood . The difference I \u2019 m aware of is 1 ) MPO uses the Q-function , while AWR uses the advantage function 2 ) MPO uses Retrace , while AWR uses TD ( \\lambda ) The use of Retrace may not be important because Retrace can also be used for AWR . If we remove the baseline from AWR and uses Retrace instead of TD ( \\lambda ) , is it equivalent to MPO ? Please correct me if I misunderstand anything .

Minor points - Although the \u201c simplicity \u201d of AWR is claimed several times , I \u2019 m not sure whether AWR is really simple because the difference between AWR and MPO is not big .", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Re : Difference wrt to MPO A crucial difference between MPO and AWR that allows AWR to work well with offline datasets is the actions used to update the policy . During policy updates for MPO , new actions are sampled from the policy , which may be different from the actions observed during the rollouts . These actions are then scored by the Q function and used to update the policy . However , one problem with this update scheme is that it can cause out-of-distribution errors when querying the Q function with actions that were not observed in the rollouts . This is one of the reasons why other off-policy algorithms such as DDPG and SAC generally do not work well for offline RL . This is also the out-of-distribution action problem that recent offline RL algorithms like BCQ and BEAR attempt to address . Unlike MPO , during the AWR updates ( Eq 10 ) , the policy is updated using only actions observed in the replay buffer . We do not need to query a Q function with new actions that may be different from those in the replay buffer . Therefore , AWR is not susceptible to issues due to errors in the value estimation on out-of-distribution actions . This is also the main reason why AWR is able to learn effective policies in the fully offlines setting . For regular RL tasks , MPO , like other DDPG style algorithms , requires a number of stabilization techniques such as double Q-learning and target networks , none of which are needed for AWR . AWR does use some standard normalization techniques , but as we show in E.2 , AWR still performs well even when these additions are disabled . AWR is therefore quite a bit simpler than algorithms like MPO . Re : SAC and TD3 on imitation tasks We have not been able to successfully apply SAC or TD3 on the motion imitation tasks with complex simulated agents . We are also not aware of any prior work that has demonstrated successful results with SAC and TD3 on learning these complex motion skills . While we are not certain of the reasons why those algorithms do not work on these tasks , off-policy algorithms such as SAC and TD3 tend to be more unstable than policy gradient algorithms . The AWR updates are more reminiscent of policy gradient methods than Q-learning based techniques , such as SAC and TD3 , which might be one of the reasons why AWR is more effective for these tasks ."}, {"review_id": "ToWi1RjuEr8-1", "review_text": "This paper focuses on developing an RL learning algorithm that is simple and can significantly improve performance over existing algorithms . The paper presents the algorithm AWR , which is an extension of the algorithm reward weighted regression .

Experiments on common environments are conducted to evaluate the performance of AWR and compare it to other algorithms . There are ablation experiments to justify the choice of some of the extensions . The development of simple , effective off-policy algorithms for reinforcement learning is still an open problem , and this paper tries to take a step towards addressing it . The paper gives a detailed derivation of the proposed algorithm , and the ablation studies provide some information as to what components in the algorithm make it useful . However , I do not believe this paper is ready for publication because the extensions are minor , and experiments lack scientific rigor , making it unclear what is to be learned from the paper .

Therefore , one should expect the presented algorithm to be a significant increase in performance . However , this can not be concluded based on the experimental methodology used . The main issues are with how hyperparameters are selected and the lack of statistical analysis of the results .

This is analogous to the advantage normalization technique used in frameworks such as OpenAI Baselines ."}, "3": {"review_id": "ToWi1RjuEr8-3", "review_text": "This paper presents a reinforcement learning algorithm that applies advantage-weighted regression . In each iteration , it samples trajectories from a mixture of previous policies , estimates the value function and then computes the advantage value to estimate the policy . The idea is very similar to the work published in \u201c Neumann , Gerhard and Peters , Jan R , Fitted Q-iteration by advantage weighted regression , Advances in neural information processing systems , 2009 \u201d , starting from reward-weighted regression and further developing to advantage weighted regression . The difference in this paper is to add a constraint on the policy search , requiring the policy to be similar to the sampling policy . However , this constraint has also been studied in the paper `` Christian Wirth and Johannes Furnkranz and Gerhard Neumann , Model-Free Preference-based Reinforcement Learning , AAAI 2017 '' ( It seems not in reference ) . Overall , it may enhance this paper if it has more technical novelty when developing a new algorithm . My major concern is that this paper has been submitted last year and resubmitted this year without new additions . Moreover , this paper has been available to the public since last year with information on authors and affiliations , which may violate the double-blind review policy ( e.g.the version updated on Oct 7 , 2019 at https : //arxiv.org/abs/1910.00177 ) .", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "reply_text": "Re : resubmission without new work We would like to point out that since the submission last year , we have added the following : More thorough discussion of similar algorithms in the related work section , and comparisons to prior algorithms such as LAWER and REPS ( Fig 8 ) Tuned and improved performance of baseline algorithms ( e.g.SAC and TD3 ) Ran experiments with more trials ( 10 seeds per algorithm ) Additional ablation experiments for design decisions such as weight clipping ( E.1 ) and normalization techniques ( E.2 ) . A more in-depth discussion of the similarities and differences to policy gradient algorithms ( Sec D ) as suggested by last year \u2019 s reviewers .
