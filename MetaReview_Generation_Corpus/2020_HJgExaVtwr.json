The idea is to model the per-sample loss distribution with a mixture model to dynamically DIVIDE the training data into (a labeled set with clean samples) and (an unlabeled set with noisy samples) and trains the model on both the labeled and unlabeled data in a semi-supervised manner. The novelty is borderline. In the area of learning with noisy labels, it is known that SSL can work under this problem setting for several years, for example, the famous method \"virtual adversarial training\" from ICLR 2016 and a recent method \"smooth neighbors on teacher graphs\" from CVPR 2018. As a consequence, it is not surprising that the latest MixMatch can work as well, since MixMatch comes from mixup, virtual adversarial training and entropy minimization.

Their algorithm tries to exploit the noisy samples by assigning a \u2018correct\u2019 label through MixMatch. It borrows the idea from both semi-supervised learning and learning with label noise. Suggestions: 1. When the author talked about \u201ccorrect the loss function\u201d, there are in fact two types of corrections: the first type tries to correct the loss function by equally treating all the samples, e.g., classical Huber loss, or F-correction. The second type tries to either re-weight samples or separate clean and noisy samples explicitly, which also results in correcting the loss function. It would be more clear if Section 2.1 can emphasize the difference between the two. 2. Also, there are other papers providing different but insightful ideas to label noise problem. The authors addressed the idea of using co-learning to avoid confirmation bias. However, it should be noted that this is not the only way to avoid confirmation bias, and their are other methods without using two networks [1-2], both providing some theoretical insights to the problem. It would be good to include them in the related work as well. 3. I would like to see a comparison of running time other than the accuracy, understanding the efficiency of each algorithm is important from a practical perspective.

Pros: -The paper bridges the area of learning with noisy labels with semi-supervised learning and proposes an interesting method to learn with noisy labels in a semi-supervised manner.
