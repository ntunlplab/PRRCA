Detailed feedback : The proposed split Poisson-Gamma ( SPG ) process seems reasonable , but in technical terms is a fairly straightforward hierarchical structure and can be constructed using standard properties of Poisson-Gamma .

Section 5.2 now states : \u201c The theoretical foundations of negative binomial regression and SPG are similar , both built upon the classical Poisson-gamma model . SPG differs from NBR in three key ways that help explain its improved performance : 1 ) SPG models mutation patterns over arbitrary sets of positions enabling it to dynamically pool information across positions after a single training ; in contrast , NBR operates on fixed regions and must be retrained for every new region size . 2 ) SPG 's variational inference method estimates the gamma parameters for each region independently ; NBR estimates only the shape parameter independently for each window and uses a single scale parameter for all windows . 3 ) SPG 's CNN data reduction enables non-linear mapping of spatial covariate information to mutation rate , whereas NBR can perform only linear inference and disregards the spatial organization of the genome. \u201d * * Comment : * * In addition to estimating mu_R and sigma_R^2 , how to place hyper priors over these parameters , and perform MAP estimations ? * * Response : * * Since mu_R and sigma_R^2 are inferred using a Gaussian process , placing hyperpriors over these terms is equivalent to the choice of GP kernel function and hyperpriors placed over the kernel parameters . We explored multiple choices of kernel function and hyperpriors and found results were robust to any particular choice .

We have updated the text to specify that all random variables are scalars in the first paragraph of section 2.2 . In our application the dimension of the covariates is 735x100 . We have revised Section 3 to clearly state this dimensionality . Thank you for the suggestion to include a plate diagram . We agree this is helpful and have added one as Figure 1e . * * Comment : * * Why was CNN chosen for dimensionality reduction ? * * Response : * * We agree that we did not clearly justify the use of a CNN in the original submission . We have now revised section 3.3 , \u201c Estimating dynamic regional rates with uncertainty , \u201d to explain that the columns encode the high-resolution spatial organization of the epigenome which have recently been shown to be important determinants of local mutation rate in particular instances ( Gonzalez-Perez et al. , 2019 ; Akdemir et al. , 2020 ) . We thus hypothesized that a convolutional neural network would provide a powerful and general approach to produce a low-dimensional embedding that retains information about this local structure ; the supervised nature of a CNN further enables the resulting embedding to be optimized for the cancer of interest , which is crucial to performance since the epigenetic organization that determines mutation rate varies drastically between cancer types ( Polak et al. , 2015 ) . We now clearly present this justification for the use of CNNs in section 3.3 . * * Comment : * * Were other non neural architectures used for dimensionality reduction ? * * Response : * * Yes , we investigated multiple other approaches for dimensionality reduction ( appendix section C.3.1 ) including linear regression-based methods , unsupervised methods ( PCA and UMAP ) and other neural architectures ( fully connected and autoencoder ) . Results from these approaches were included in the original submission as Appendix Figure 6 . We have strengthened the language in section 3.3 and section 5.1 to reinforce that we investigated other methods for dimensionality reduction including non-neural architectures and include a pointer to the Appendix . * * Comment : * * What is the significance of \u2018 735 \u2019 epigenetic tracks ? * * Response : * * Thank you for pointing out that this number is mysterious . As we described in Section 3 , the ways the genome is chemically modified and organized are crucial determinants of mutation rate . Epigenetic tracks are datasets that assay the presence of these chemical modifications all across the genome . The 735 tracks we use represent the largest set of uniformly processed human epigenome data currently available . We have now added this statement to section 3.1 to clarify to the reader why we chose this particular set of data as input . * * Comment : * * How valid is the assumption that events are distributed independently in the mutation space ? I think this is too restrictive but at the same time simplifies the problem . A discussion of this simplification will be essential for the medical/biology audience . * * Response : * * A good point and one that has been recently considered in the literature : perhaps surprisingly , previous work has established that somatic mutations are approximately independent given the immediate nucleotide composition around a genomic position ( Martincorena et al. , 2017 , Dietlein et al. , 2019 ) . Indeed , work from Martincorena and colleagues established that just the trinucleotide composition , as used in our work , is nearly always sufficient to render neighboring positions approximately independent . We have added this information and justification for the independence assumption to the second paragraph of discussion . * * Comment : * * Title of paper has 'causes ' . Title on ICLR webpage has 'cusses ' . Please correct if possible . * * Response : * * Thank you for pointing out this embarrassing typo !

We thus hypothesized that a convolutional neural network would provide a powerful and general approach to produce a low-dimensional embedding that retains information about this local structure ; the supervised nature of a CNN further enables the resulting embedding to be optimized for the cancer of interest , which is crucial to performance since the epigenetic organization that determines mutation rate varies drastically between cancer types ( Polak et al. , 2015 ) . We now clearly present this justification for the use of CNNs in section 3.3 . * * Comment : * * Were other non neural architectures used for dimensionality reduction ? * * Response : * * Yes , we investigated multiple other approaches for dimensionality reduction ( appendix section C.3.1 ) including linear regression-based methods , unsupervised methods ( PCA and UMAP ) and other neural architectures ( fully connected and autoencoder ) . Results from these approaches were included in the original submission as Appendix Figure 6 . We have strengthened the language in section 3.3 and section 5.1 to reinforce that we investigated other methods for dimensionality reduction including non-neural architectures and include a pointer to the Appendix . * * Comment : * * What is the significance of \u2018 735 \u2019 epigenetic tracks ? * * Response : * * Thank you for pointing out that this number is mysterious . As we described in Section 3 , the ways the genome is chemically modified and organized are crucial determinants of mutation rate . Epigenetic tracks are datasets that assay the presence of these chemical modifications all across the genome . The 735 tracks we use represent the largest set of uniformly processed human epigenome data currently available . We have now added this statement to section 3.1 to clarify to the reader why we chose this particular set of data as input . * * Comment : * * How valid is the assumption that events are distributed independently in the mutation space ? I think this is too restrictive but at the same time simplifies the problem . A discussion of this simplification will be essential for the medical/biology audience . * * Response : * * A good point and one that has been recently considered in the literature : perhaps surprisingly , previous work has established that somatic mutations are approximately independent given the immediate nucleotide composition around a genomic position ( Martincorena et al. , 2017 , Dietlein et al. , 2019 ) . Indeed , work from Martincorena and colleagues established that just the trinucleotide composition , as used in our work , is nearly always sufficient to render neighboring positions approximately independent . We have added this information and justification for the independence assumption to the second paragraph of discussion . * * Comment : * * Title of paper has 'causes ' . Title on ICLR webpage has 'cusses ' . Please correct if possible . * * Response : * * Thank you for pointing out this embarrassing typo ! We have corrected the online title ."}}
