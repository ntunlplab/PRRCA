Can the link be made more precise, by explaining what a deformation of a signal would be on a graph, or by applying arguments from the proposed construction to the Euclidian case? - the paper is heavy on terminology from wavelets and harmonic analysis, a more detailed presentation of diffusion wavelets and related concepts such as localization would be beneficial. Also, it seems like the chosen wavelets in the construction favor spatial over frequential localization - is this due to a trade-off? if so, can it be avoided?

Thank you for your understanding . * REVIEW : \u201c Nevertheless , some parts of paper would benefit from further discussions and more clarity : - other than empirically , one aspect that 's missing compared to the original study of the scattering transform is energy preservation . The authors could at least provide a discussion of whether such a property can be obtained here as well ( does it depend on the spectral gap through C ( beta ) ? ) \u201d RESPONSE : Thank you for bringing up this important point . Energy preservation in scattering representations requires a unitary wavelet decomposition . In the original scattering paper ( Mallat , 2012 ) , it was proved for a restricted class of unitary wavelets in R^d , and later extended to more general families of analytic wavelets ( Wiatowski , Grohs and B\u00f6lcskei , 2017 ) . Extending energy preservation to graph scattering thus amounts to constructing graph wavelets that are unitary and analytic . Whereas constructing unitary wavelets on graphs is easily achieved ( for instance designing the wavelets in the spectral domain ) , the analytic property in general graphs requires a notion of frequency \u2018 pairings \u2019 ( analogously as one associates sine and cosine in an Euclidean domain ) . This is a fascinating direction of future research . We note that our diffusion wavelets are neither unitary nor analytic . However , as you correctly observed , the frame bounds do depend on the domain via the spectral gap . The lower bound is ( 1-beta ) ^2 , so the smaller 1-beta is , the less \u201c unitary \u201d our diffusion wavelets are . We have mentioned this issue after Proposition 4.1 which establishes bounds on the energy change when applying the graph diffusion wavelet bank . REVIEW : \u201c - what is the role of the spectral gap in the stability bounds ? is this a drawback of the diffusion metric / choice of wavelets ? \u201d RESPONSE : The spectral gap is tightly linked with diffusion processes on graphs , and thus it does emerge from the choice of a diffusion metric . Graphs with values of beta closer to 1 , exhibit weaker diffusion paths , and thus a small perturbation on the edges of these graphs would lead to a larger diffusion distance . The contrary holds as well . In other words , the tolerance of the graph to edge perturbations ( i.e. , d ( G , G \u2019 ) being small ) depends on the spectral gap of the graph . Another interpretation of the spectral gap is as the \u2018 bandwidth \u2019 of the domain . The larger the gap ( thus smaller beta ) , the faster the domain diffusion blurs an input arbitrary signal , therefore limiting our ability to discriminate high-frequency information . A byproduct of this reduced bandwidth ( small beta ) are improved stability bounds . We have added a remark about this aspect at the end of section 5 ."}, {"review_id": "BygqBiRcFQ-1", "review_text": "The paper introduces scattering transforms on graphs by adopting diffusion wavelet constructions, and gives an extension of the scattering transforms to non-Euclidean domains.

We would like to let the reviewer know that the choice of diffusion distance and consequently , diffusion wavelets , is rooted in mathematical tractability . Nevertheless , the general framework for the proof is extensible to any other domain or deformation measure that offers bounds similar to those in Lemmas 5.1 and 5.2 . In fact , we are currently working on extensions to general wavelet graph filters and Gromov-Hausdorff distances , as well as continuous domains .

We consider this work to be of theoretical value , showing stability of deep learning constructions on graphs . In this sense , the objective of the simulation section is to illustrate , as well , the ability of the graph scattering transforms to obtain meaningful representations . By no means is our intention to claim that we perform better than the state of the art , and we apologize for any such misunderstanding that might have arised from our writing in that section . The choice of comparison methods is guided by the following rationale . We know that linear methods are unstable under deformations , and we propose an alternative representation that we prove is stable . Therefore , for the numerical sections , we chose two widely used linear models : one data-based ( SVM ) and one structural-based ( GFT ) with the aim of showing that there is no loss in the representation capability by using a stable representation . In other words , our main goal of this section is to prove that we can do as well as linear models , while guaranteeing for stability . As a byproduct , we observed that the proposed representation outperforms these linear models , but this , by no means , implies that this is the best possible solution for these problems . With respect to comparing with graph convnets , we find that the methods are conceptually different since graph scattering representations do not involve any training . In this respect , we could compare with graph convnets with a minimal training set of one ( or zero ) in which case scattering transforms would do better , or we could compare with graph convnets for the case in which we have a large training set , in which case graph convnets will surely fare better . Therefore , we believe these methods not to be comparable . Finally , we note that the stability analysis that we carried out for diffusion scattering also applies to Graph Convnets ( see corollary 5.3 ) . In this case , our stability bounds depend on the trainable parameters , and are generally not tight . Similarly as in the case of images , and as illustrated by adversarial examples , there is an underlying tradeoff between discriminability and stability . All in all , we have completely rewritten the simulation section making emphasis on the illustrative nature of these examples , and have carefully worded every claim to avoid any misunderstanding .

Similarly to the Euclidian domain , it is shown that linear filters can not provide representations that are simultaneously rich and stable. \u201d RESPONSE : Thank you very much for the time spent in reviewing this manuscript and the valuable insights provided . REVIEW : \u201c Generally , the paper is pretty complete , interesting and sufficiently well presented . One might wonder if the choice of the diffusion framework for both the representation construction , and the deformation analysis , is a simplistic choice , and how similar ideas could extend to different domain deformation for example. \u201d RESPONSE : We thank the reviewer for bringing up this point . We would like to let the reviewer know that the choice of diffusion distance and consequently , diffusion wavelets , is rooted in mathematical tractability . Nevertheless , the general framework for the proof is extensible to any other domain or deformation measure that offers bounds similar to those in Lemmas 5.1 and 5.2 . In fact , we are currently working on extensions to general wavelet graph filters and Gromov-Hausdorff distances , as well as continuous domains . We have added comments on this after Def . 3.1 where the diffusion distance is introduced , and in the conclusions to highlight future work . REVIEW : \u201c The experiments and comparisons are also very minimal , and hard to interpret . Comparing things only with GFT and SVM is probability a 'easy ' choice , with the advent of a plethora of new graph convnets architectures ( GFT is probably not a 'graph baseline ' , as mentioned in the conclusion ) . \u201d RESPONSE : First and foremost , we would like to apologize for the statements included in the numerical section that might have accidentally misrepresented the claims made in that section . We consider this work to be of theoretical value , showing stability of deep learning constructions on graphs . In this sense , the objective of the simulation section is to illustrate , as well , the ability of the graph scattering transforms to obtain meaningful representations . By no means is our intention to claim that we perform better than the state of the art , and we apologize for any such misunderstanding that might have arised from our writing in that section . The choice of comparison methods is guided by the following rationale . We know that linear methods are unstable under deformations , and we propose an alternative representation that we prove is stable . Therefore , for the numerical sections , we chose two widely used linear models : one data-based ( SVM ) and one structural-based ( GFT ) with the aim of showing that there is no loss in the representation capability by using a stable representation . In other words , our main goal of this section is to prove that we can do as well as linear models , while guaranteeing for stability . As a byproduct , we observed that the proposed representation outperforms these linear models , but this , by no means , implies that this is the best possible solution for these problems . With respect to comparing with graph convnets , we find that the methods are conceptually different since graph scattering representations do not involve any training . In this respect , we could compare with graph convnets with a minimal training set of one ( or zero ) in which case scattering transforms would do better , or we could compare with graph convnets for the case in which we have a large training set , in which case graph convnets will surely fare better . Therefore , we believe these methods not to be comparable . Finally , we note that the stability analysis that we carried out for diffusion scattering also applies to Graph Convnets ( see corollary 5.3 ) . In this case , our stability bounds depend on the trainable parameters , and are generally not tight . Similarly as in the case of images , and as illustrated by adversarial examples , there is an underlying tradeoff between discriminability and stability . All in all , we have completely rewritten the simulation section making emphasis on the illustrative nature of these examples , and have carefully worded every claim to avoid any misunderstanding . REVIEW : \u201c This is however an interesting work , that will likely generate exciting discussions at ICLR. \u201d RESPONSE : We would like to thank the reviewer again for their time and effort spent in providing valuable feedback on our work ."}}
