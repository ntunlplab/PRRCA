Most spatio-temporal graph neural network based methods can be easily trapped into bad local optima due to overfitting when the size of training set is limited , resulting in a significant drop of classification accuracy .

Building on previously introduced Graph Scattering Transform ( GST ) , the authors investigate the technical question of how to use both the spatial and temporal dimensions , proposing either a joint construction ( GST applied on product graph ) or a separate one ( keeping both dimensions separate conceptually , while mixing ) . Theoretical results valid in both cases guarantee stability to noise in the input signal or the spatial graph . Numerical experiments show that the proposed method outperforms graph convolutional networks in the small data regime , and get a performance close to the state-of-the-art in the large data regime . 2/ Acceptance decision Accept .

Further , the authors provide theoretical guarantees of the stability of the ST-GST representation with respect to input and spatial graph variations , based on assumptions on the pre-defined filters used in the transform . - Experimental results show that in the very low data regime ( MSR Action3D dataset with only 288 training samples ) , the proposed approach improves upon the graph convolutional networks SOTA by ~5 % of accuracy ( 87 vs 82.2 ) . In the large data regime , the proposed method reaches a performance close to SOTA ( 73.1 vs 75.8 % accuracy ) . The authors also show that the gap between GCN and ST-GST widens as the number of samples decreases . - This paper is well motivated and well written . Although it is quite dense and with involved mathematical operations , it is quite easy to follow . 4/ Additional comments - The authors do a very nice job of putting the joint and separable graph filters under similar notations ( Eq.1 and 2 ) .When it comes to comparing both approaches at the end of Sec 3.2 , I am not sure to understand correctly the statement that the separable approach is more \u00ab flexible \u00bb than the joint one . While I understand that separability brings an easier interpretability of filter responses in the spatial and temporal domain , it seems also that in terms of polynomials with atoms of the form $ \\lambda_s^p \\otimes \\Lambda_t^q $ for various $ p $ , $ q $ , the family spanned by separable transforms might be smaller than e.g.the strong product ( although I \u2019 m not sure ) . Do you have any more insights in this direction ? - In the numerical results of Table 1 , the separable approach gets the better results with much more scales in the temporal dim ( 20 ) than in the spatial one ( 5 ) . In the joint approaches , a single number of scales ( 15 ) is used , and it spans both dimensions .

This thus makes the separable graph filters more flexible than the joint graph filters . However , in terms of the representation power of these two formulations , the family spanned by joint graph filters ( either Kronecker , Cartesian or strong product ) and the family spanned by separable graph filters do not have a clear relationship that one is a subset of the other . We can show this through a toy example . Consider a graph filter with a strong product graph and the filter order $ K=3 $ , we can write the kernel of strong product graph filter as $ \\mathbf\\ { H\\ } ( \\mathbf\\ { \\Lambda\\ } _s\\otimes \\mathbf\\ { \\Lambda\\ } _t+\\mathbf\\ { \\Lambda\\ } _s\\otimes \\mathbf\\ { I\\ } _T+\\mathbf\\ { I\\ } _N\\otimes \\mathbf\\ { \\Lambda\\ } _t ) =\\sum_\\ { k=0\\ } ^2 h_k ( \\mathbf\\ { \\Lambda\\ } _s\\otimes \\mathbf\\ { \\Lambda\\ } _t+\\mathbf\\ { \\Lambda\\ } _s\\otimes \\mathbf\\ { I\\ } _T+\\mathbf\\ { I\\ } _N\\otimes \\mathbf\\ { \\Lambda\\ } _t ) ^k $ . By expanding the expression and rearranging the coefficients , we can have the following coefficient matrix $ $ C=\\begin\\ { bmatrix\\ } h_0 & h_1 & h_2 \\\\\\\\ h_1 & h_1+2h_2 & 2h_2 \\\\\\\\ h_2 & 2h_2 & h_2 \\end\\ { bmatrix\\ } , $ $ where $ C_\\ { ij\\ } $ means the coefficient of term $ \\mathbf\\ { \\Lambda\\ } _s^\\ { i-1\\ } \\otimes \\mathbf\\ { \\Lambda\\ } _t^\\ { j-1\\ } $ . On other hand , the kernel of separable graph filter with $ P=Q=3 $ can be written as $ \\mathbf\\ { A\\ } ( \\mathbf\\ { \\Lambda\\ } _s ) \\otimes \\mathbf\\ { B\\ } ( \\mathbf\\ { \\Lambda\\ } _t ) = ( \\sum_\\ { k=0\\ } ^2 a_k \\mathbf\\ { \\Lambda\\ } _s^k ) \\otimes ( \\sum_\\ { k=0\\ } ^2 b_k \\mathbf\\ { \\Lambda\\ } _t^k ) $ . By the same rearranging procedure , we can have the coefficient matrix for separable graph filter as $ $ D=\\begin\\ { bmatrix\\ } a_0b_0 & a_0b_1 & a_0b_2 \\\\\\\\ a_1b_0 & a_1b_1 & a_1b_2 \\\\\\\\ a_2b_0 & a_2b_1 & a_2b_2 \\end\\ { bmatrix\\ } = \\begin\\ { bmatrix\\ } a_0 \\\\\\\\ a_1 \\\\\\\\ a_2 \\end\\ { bmatrix\\ } \\begin\\ { bmatrix\\ } b_0 & b_1 & b_2 \\end\\ { bmatrix\\ } . $ $ If the family spanned by one method is a subset of the other , then one of the coefficient matrix must be a special case of the other one . On one hand , it is obvious that $ D $ is always a rank 1 matrix , while $ C $ could have rank 1 , 2 , or 3 . So $ C $ is not a special case of $ D $ . On the other hand , $ C $ is always a symmetric matrix , but $ D $ can be either symmetric or non-symmetric . Furthermore , the ratio between several pairs of elements in $ C $ is fixed , for example $ C_\\ { 32\\ } /C_\\ { 31\\ } $ is always 2 in this case ; however , $ D_\\ { 32\\ } /D_\\ { 31\\ } =b_1/b_0 $ can be an arbitrary value . So $ D $ is also not a special case of $ C $ . Therefore , the families spanned by two different methods do not have any simple relationship that one is a subset of the other . This conclusion also holds for the Kronecker and Cartesian products . In short , the joint and separable graph filters are two different design methods for spatio-temporal graphs . Though the representation power of separable graph filters is not necessarily much stronger than joint ones , separable design enjoys the flexibility , computation efficiency and straightforward interpretation ."}, {"review_id": "CF-ZIuSMXRz-3", "review_text": "I will add it tomorrow", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We thank Reviewer 1 for her/his review of the manuscript .
