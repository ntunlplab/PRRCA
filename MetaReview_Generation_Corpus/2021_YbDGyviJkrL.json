It is composed of two components trained sequentially.  A first one learns embedding from observations using a seq2seq approach, where the embeddings are constrained to follow linear dynamics. This is inspired by approximation schemes for Koopman operators. These embeddings are then used as the spatio-temporal series representions and are fed to a transformer trained as an autoregressive predictor. Experiments are performed on different problems using data generated from PDEs through numerical schemes. Comparisons are performed with different ML baselines.\n\nThe paper is well written with experiments on problems with different complexities. The original contributions of the paper are 1) the combination of pretrained embeddings with a transformer auto-regressor, 2) a seq2seq architecture for learning time series representations constrained by linear dynamics.\n\nOn the cons side, the paper original contribution and significance are over claimed. Closely related ideas for learning approximate Koopman operators and observables have already been developed and used in similar contexts. Besides there is no discussion here on the properties or physical interpretability (which is often an argument for Koopman) of the learned representations. Then the baselines are mainly composed of simple regressors (LSTM, conv-LSTM, etc.) and this is not a surprise that they cannot learn dynamics over long term horizons. There is no comparison with dynamical models incorporating numerical integration schemes that could model the temporal dynamics of the system. There is now a large literature on this topic exploiting discrete (ResNet like) or continuous formulations (as started with Neural ODE).", "reviews": [{"review_id": "YbDGyviJkrL-0", "review_text": "# # # Summary : The paper proposes to use transformers for modelling dynamical systems .

Have you considered training the embeddings jointly with the transformer parameters ? I think this baseline is needed to motivate the need for pretrained embeddings and it could alleviate the concern that the model limitations are due to the `` inaccuracies of the embedding model '' . * * * The authors did indeed consider training the embedding model and transformer together as well as fine tuning the embedding model once the transformer has been trained . However we selected , that a pre-training approach of the embedding model would be a preferred approach for two main reasons as stated in the paper : the first is to remain as parallel as possible to NLP approaches ( such as the use of word2vec and Byte Pair Encodings ) to help support the idea that the default transformer is directly applicable to physical dynamics . The second is to make the training of the transformer models more computationally tractable . Due to the potential domain sizes of physical systems and the size of modern transformers , training such transformers in the state space would prove to be very difficult with the needed memory requirements . * * * * The authors did however refactor the code base to test the reviewer 's suggestion for the Lorenz numerical test case . Using the same loss approach used to train the transformer but in the state-space ( avoiding any back-prop through time ) , the authors found that jointly training the embedding model and transformer optimizes correctly but yields extremely poor predictions . We believe that this is largely due to the model simply disregarding the transformer/self-attention and predicting the reconstruction of only next time-step . Thus time-integration using the transformer in the embedding space does not work properly . We speculate that without a fixed embedding , it is likely a back-prop through time or sequential training methodology maybe required but this would be going against one of the key benefits of the transformer . * * * * Regarding the comment of `` inaccuracies of the embedding model '' in the paper , this was intended to refer to the required dimensionality reduction ( from 65536 to a 512-dimensional vector ) . We believe this is fairly aggressive for the reaction diffusion system . We have added a note to make this clear .

The authors agree that this should be more explicitly stated and have added a discussion prior to Section 2.1 . Additionally , we have added a schematic that shows the two distinct training phases . * * * My second concern is about the experimental part . The dynamical systems are also limited in complexity , but this is not crucial here .

These concerns are not individually prohibitive for such a article , and maybe the paper could be improved before publication . Nevertheless , the ideas are really interesting . * * * The selected numerical examples are based on classical dynamical systems that are typically investigated in scientific machine learning . Namely , the Lorenz and the cylinder numerical examples . Thus we placed a priority on examples that could directly resonate with the physical modeling and ML communities . The 3D Gray-Scott model was an additional choice to demonstrate the potential of this methodology to more complex , higher-dimensional systems . * * * * Regarding the results of the CNN for the flow around a cylinder , we note that the convolutional model does n't perform poorly in the sense that it is still able to produce physically accurate vortex shedding ( one of the reasons we included Figs.13 and 14 in the appendix ) . The CNN model struggles with the initial transition from laminar to vortex shedding . Due to the Markovian dependence , once the model deviates , it will continue to be inconsistent with the numerical solver . We added a comment at the end of Section 4 to clarify this for the reader . * * * In the introduction , authors claim that : `` Standard deep neural network architectures such as auto-regressive , recurrent and LSTM based models have been largely demonstrated to be effective at modeling various physical dynamics ( ... ) However , the current literature is focused on systems of limited complexity and domain size .

Have you considered training the embeddings jointly with the transformer parameters ? I think this baseline is needed to motivate the need for pretrained embeddings and it could alleviate the concern that the model limitations are due to the `` inaccuracies of the embedding model '' . * * * The authors did indeed consider training the embedding model and transformer together as well as fine tuning the embedding model once the transformer has been trained . However we selected , that a pre-training approach of the embedding model would be a preferred approach for two main reasons as stated in the paper : the first is to remain as parallel as possible to NLP approaches ( such as the use of word2vec and Byte Pair Encodings ) to help support the idea that the default transformer is directly applicable to physical dynamics . The second is to make the training of the transformer models more computationally tractable . Due to the potential domain sizes of physical systems and the size of modern transformers , training such transformers in the state space would prove to be very difficult with the needed memory requirements . * * * * The authors did however refactor the code base to test the reviewer 's suggestion for the Lorenz numerical test case . Using the same loss approach used to train the transformer but in the state-space ( avoiding any back-prop through time ) , the authors found that jointly training the embedding model and transformer optimizes correctly but yields extremely poor predictions . We believe that this is largely due to the model simply disregarding the transformer/self-attention and predicting the reconstruction of only next time-step . Thus time-integration using the transformer in the embedding space does not work properly . We speculate that without a fixed embedding , it is likely a back-prop through time or sequential training methodology maybe required but this would be going against one of the key benefits of the transformer . * * * * Regarding the comment of `` inaccuracies of the embedding model '' in the paper , this was intended to refer to the required dimensionality reduction ( from 65536 to a 512-dimensional vector ) . We believe this is fairly aggressive for the reaction diffusion system . We have added a note to make this clear . Thank you . * *"}}
