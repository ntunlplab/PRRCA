Given that all the reviewers agreed the paper is well written, I'm inclined to think the paper will be a useful contribution to the literature. The authors also highlight the analysis of the discretization, which seems to be missed by the most critical reviewer. I would suggest to the reviewers that they use the criticisms to rework the paper's introduction, to better explain which parts of the work are novel and which parts are standard. I would also suggest that standard background be moved to the appendix so that it is there for the nonexpert, while making the body of the work more focused on the novel aspects.", "reviews": [{"review_id": "SJfPFjA9Fm-0", "review_text": "The paper considers 'replica exchange' Langevin dynamics.
