R2 : ( Role of the results of Theorem 1 ) Response : The theoretical results in Theorem 1 indicate that our proposed method is robust against label noise given a particular noise level ( presented by the number of noisy label triplets in the problem setup ) in the sense of the Bayesian inference framework . Without those results , we can not guarantee that the learning performance won \u2019 t be significantly affected , even with a small noise level -- this is crucial due to the sensitivity of deep models under noisy labels . R2 : ( Robustness in [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] ) Response : First , we would like to emphasize that the main idea of our paper is to introduce the use of Bayesian inference targeting a robust deep metric learning under noisy labels , while both [ 1 ] & [ 2 ] do not take the robustness against noisy labels into account . We agree with the reviewer that the definition of the robustness of metric learning in those papers is interesting since they can provide an explicit generalization bound . However , they are not associated with the robustness under noisy labels considered in our paper . We , therefore , plan to work on a more concrete definition/verification robustness based on those papers , e.g. , to provide an upper bound for the generalization error when training with noisy labels . We will add that to the revised version of our paper with the clarification above .
