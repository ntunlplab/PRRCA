The novelty is in proposing a weighted reconstruction error that penalizes the mapping of data with high reconstruction errors (mostly anomalies) into high probability regions. The idea being that an outlier would have a higher reconstruction error, and hence should be mapped to low-probability region of the latent distribution. Experimental Results: As a distribution mapping auto-encoder model, OP-DMA outperforms the deep learning based state-of-the-art models in the same domain. Overall Assessment: The authors have a nice idea of forcing the latent mappings of inputs to correlate with their reconstruction error. Overall, the method is promising, but I have the following concerns: * Using the reconstruction error as an anomaly score has been explored many years ago (check replicator neural networks), the novelty here is to enforce that on the latent space in the context of a variational auto-encoder. I am not sure if, from anomaly detection perspective, this is any better than simply using the reconstruction score. Why go the VAE route at all? * Is there a possibility that assuming a single multi-variate Gaussian, as a prior, too restrictive? Could it result in a high false alarm rate as well? I guess this could be answered by more experimental results on richer data sets (even synthetic is fine). * In most score based algorithms, the anomaly score is computed without assuming any prior knowledge about the contamination proportion. However, in the case of OP-DMA, the contamination parameter is used to train the auto-encoder that scores the data. This might result in an optimization that is very specific to the parameter setting. I strongly recommend a sensitivity analysis to study the robustness of the model against different values of contamination parameter. * Performance on synthetic data-set has not been presented. The set H in theorem 3 has not been defined. * Additional comparison with other non-distribution mapping state-of-the-art models such as LOF, oc-SVM, KNN would give a clearer idea of the performance. This is important, because in my past experience, non-deep learning methods give much better results on the benchmark data sets that the authors have evaluated their method on. In fact, a comparative analysis (See - https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0152173) gives a very nice comparison. However, since the authors provide results using Avg F1-score, instead of AUC curve, it was not possible to compare them myself. * In figure 3, in the training process, the authors have describe to add the divergence between the latent and prior distribution to the loss function, however, nothing like this is clearly shown in the figure.The references of figures in the text are either out of place or incorrect. Figure 1(a) and (b) in reference to the text are incorrect. Figure 2 is the misleading figure as it doesn't illustrate the anomaly detection process.

", "rating": "3: Weak Reject", "reply_text": "We thank you for your detailed feedback and time on our work . Your insights are very much appreciated . We have fixed the typos , incorrect references to figures and added in reference to AAEs in our experimental section . QUESTION 1 . \u201c the novelty here is to enforce that on the latent space in the context of a variational auto-encoder . I am not sure if , from anomaly detection perspective , this is any better than simply using the reconstruction score . Why go the VAE route at all ? \u201d OUR RESPONSE . To address your question , the reason the distribution mapping framework is important is that it allows us to calculate the likelihood of each point in the latent space , which can be leveraged to weight the reconstruction error of each point by its likelihood . The reason we do this weighting rather than just directly using this reconstruction error is that in standard autoencoders the average reconstruction error for outliers and the average reconstruction error for inliers often tends to converge to the same value . This is in fact what we show experimentally in Figure 4 ( a ) . As can be seen , the autoencoder initially has a higher reconstruction error for outliers than inliers , but iit is quickly able to reproduce both inliers and outliers roughly equally well before converging . Our OP-DMA solution , on the other hand , succeeds to maintain this difference in reconstruction error throughout the training process . We accomplish this by weighting the reconstruction loss for outliers by their likelihood in the latent space . By performing distribution mapping and making the distribution of the latent space match a prior distribution for which the PDF is known and tractible , we can calculate the likelihood of each point in the latent space . Also , just to be clear , we indeed use a WAE architecture rather than a VAE solution in our work as you can see in Section 3 . The reason for this is that , unlike a VAE , the WAE encourages the latent representations as a whole to match the prior , as also detailed in our Section 3 . QUESTION 2 : \u201c Is there a possibility that assuming a single multi-variate Gaussian , as a prior , is too restrictive ? Could it result in a high false alarm rate as well ? \u201d OUR RESPONSE . A multivariate Gaussian prior for the latent space of VAEs and WAEs has been shown to be sufficient to represent data in well in a variety of domains including those characterized by very complicated data , including images [ 1 ] and text [ 2 ] . QUESTION 3 : \u201c In most score-based algorithms , the anomaly score is computed without assuming any prior knowledge about the contamination proportion . However , in the case of OP-DMA , the contamination parameter is used to train the auto-encoder that scores the data. \u201d OUR RESPONSE . No , this observation is incorrect . The autoencoder of OP-DMA does * * * NOT * * * use the contamination parameter . Only the EllipticEnvelope method requires the contamination parameter , in order to fit a robust covariance estimate to the encoded data . This means that one could switch out another algorithm for the anomaly detection step , such as OC-SVM , that does not require the contamination parameter and nothing about the OP-DMA network training procedure would change . Still , to address your concern , we have now added an additional sensitivity analysis of OP-DMA on the Satellite dataset to the Appendix of our paper . This analysis shows that the performance of EllipticEnvelope on the encoded data is robust as long as the contamination percentage is not grossly underestimated . QUESTION 4 \u201c Additional comparison with other non-distribution mapping state-of-the-art models such as LOF , oc-SVM , KNN would give a clearer idea of the performance. \u201d OUR RESPONSE . As you have requested , we have now added additional experiments with the state-of-the-art models including the ones you have suggested , namely , OC-SVM and LOF , into our paper . The results are shown in Table 2 . It is apparent from the results that indeed our OP-DMA solution consistently outperforms these state-of-the-art methods in all but 2 of the datasets .

We have added this to the statement of theorem 3 . QUESTION 4 : \u201c In figure 3 , in the training process , the authors have describe to add the divergence between the latent and prior distribution to the loss function , however , nothing like this is clearly shown in the figure. \u201d OUR RESPONSE : Thank you for alerting us to this . We have added an arrow from the divergence to the loss function in Figure 3 . [ 1 ] Pu , Yunchen , et al . `` Variational autoencoder for deep learning of images , labels and captions .
