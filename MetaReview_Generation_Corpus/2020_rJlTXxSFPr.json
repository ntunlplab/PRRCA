The aim of this loss method to control the trade off between quality vs diversity while generating the text data.

The details of the approach are provided clearly. 3. The experiments are provided in two different datasets and also the experiments support the two major claims in the paper. Cons: 1.

The only difference is the introduction of \\pi, which controls the percentage of labelled data to be considered between the generated data and original data. Basically, Li et al.
