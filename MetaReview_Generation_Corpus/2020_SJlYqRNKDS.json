'' - When we make Assumptions 2 , 4 $ \\ & $ 8 , constants $ D_b $ , $ \\sigma_b $ and $ G_b $ are already the unknown `` \\textit { smallest } '' ( tight ) constants . Given that constants $ D_b $ , $ \\sigma_b $ and $ G_b $ are the smallest ones , the corresponding inequalities $ D_b^2 \\leq \\sum_ { i \\in \\mathcal { G } _b } D_i^2 $ and $ \\sqrt { \\frac { \\max_b\\max_ { i\\in\\tilde { \\mathcal { G } } _b } G_ { i } ^2 + \\epsilon^2 } { \\max_b G_b^2 + \\epsilon^2 } } \\geq 1 $ hold . - We add extra experiment to estimate $ \\sqrt { \\frac { \\bar { v } _ { T , d } + \\epsilon^2 } { \\bar { v } _ { T , \\tilde { B } } + \\epsilon^2 } } $ and $ \\min ( r_1 , r_2 , r_3 ) $ for B.2 , B.3 and B.4 . The numbers are shown in Appendix B of the revision . `` assess performance against previously proposed layer wise stepwise approaches mentioned in the introduction. `` - As requested , we add comparison to LARS ( You et al. , 2017 ) , the results on CIFAR-10 and Wikitext-2 are : LARS : $ 6.60 \\pm 0.17 $ on ResNet56 , $ 6.15 \\pm 0.21 $ on ResNet110 , and $ 65.38 \\pm 0.08 $ on AWD-LSTM . LARS improves over NAG and Adam . However , it is still worse than BAGM-B.1 and BAGM-B.4 on CIFAR-10 , and is worse than BAGM-B.2 on training AWD-LSTM . For the experiment on ImageNet , we have tried a number of hyper-parameters , but none of them allow LARS to converge . `` These related approaches should also be discussed more deeply and contrasted against qualitatively . '' - These approaches are heuristic and do not have convergence analysis . Algorithmically , these layer-wise methods consider incorporating gradient normalization into the learning rate , while our method averages the estimate of the second moments of each block , which is more related to coordinate-wise adaptive methods . `` The empirical results are not substantially superior ... `` - Improvements on these competitive datasets are usually not very substantial . Here , we compare our improvements with those of other papers ( that are not addressing the same problem as ours ) on the same dataset . For example , on ImageNet , BAGM-B.1 has 0.15 % better accuracy than NAG ; while in Table 8 , `` Wide residual networks '' , changing from ResNet152 to WRN-50-2-bottleneck achieves a similar 0.26 % improvement . On language modeling , BAGM-B.2 reduces perplexity by 0.46 compared to NAG ; while in Table 2 , ( Merity et al. , 2017 ) , changing from a 2-layer skip connection LSTM to AWD-LSTM only improves perplexity by 0.1 . On the other hand , the test error of BAGM-B.1 on ResNet56 is lower than those of NAG and Adam on ResNet110 . - From Tables 1,2 & 3 , it can be seen that standard deviation of all methods are already very small relative to the error rate ( % ) ."}}
