However, the aggregated initial scores for this work were past the threshold for acceptance. Reviewer 2 was the most critical of the work but did not engage in dialog or comment on the author response. \n\nConsensus:\nThe two positive reviewers felt that this work is worth of presentation at ICLR.

The proposed approach is apply CycleGAN, which was developed for image style transfer, to transfer spectrograms. The synthesis is done using WaveNet. The paper is interesting in the core idea. It demonstrates that this combination of building blocks can indeed map recordings while achieving certain characteristics of the target instrument. The paper correctly describes \"timbre\" as a catch-all term for characterizing instruments besides pitch and volume. The success of the method should be judged along two dimensions, which are both very subjective: - Does the method transfer \"enough\" of the target instrument's characteristics? - Is the resulting audio quality sufficient? The paper is easy to follow for someone with background in signal processing. I believe it is sufficiently easy to follow for readers with general computer-science and machine-learning background. The paper focusses a lot on the choice of spectral representation. It compares short-term Fourier transform (STFT), which is the generic standard, and Constant-Q Transforms (CQT), a variant of STFT that uses a logarithmic frequency axis. To someone with signal-processing background, the choice of CQT seems logical and not something that would be challenged strongly as long as a simple comparison to STFT confirms that it works a bit better. I find the comparison between the two too dominant in the paper, and distracting from the other issues that I feel are more important (see below). For example, Section 6.2 states \"We demonstrate that the aforementioned translation does indeed result in a perceivable pitch shift when fed to our conditional WaveNet.\" But that is trivial: Since changing the playback sample rate by a few half steps does not fundamentally alter the perceived timbre of an instrument, and such a change will, by construction of CQT, shift the CQT representation, and since the WaveNet has seen examples of the source instrument for all notes, shifting the CQT respresentation must necessarily result in a perceived pitch change in the re-synthesized wveform that does not fundamentally change its timbre. The real question here is whether the reconstructed signal is of the same quality as, for example, a simple PSOLA-based pitch change would be. A larger problem of the paper is that the result section seems to only test two instrument mappings, violin to flute, and piano to harpsichord. One notes that these instrument pairs mostly differ in spectral envelope, while they are rather similar in longer-term temporal variations, such as what is sometimes characterized as the ADSR curve (attack-decay-sustain-release) and vibrato. These, in my view, are very important aspects of a musical instrument's characteristics, which are not addressed by the paper. (Whether they are considered part of \"timbre\" is not clear, but without mapping these, one cannot meaningfully speak of mapping instruments, which is the end goal of this paper.) Another big problem in my view is that the audio quality is just not good. I hear a lot of musical-noise artifacts and local timbre modulations. Also it is not clear why the source material is of poor quality (sounds quite noisy, most likely in part due to mu-law 8-bit encoding, and they sound like 11 kHz recordings), for which there is no justification in 2018. Lastly, I am not happy with the \"beam-search\" approach. That approach is used to post-correct imperfections in the WaveNet synthesis. It samples multiple generation hypotheses, and re-weights hypotheses by how well they match the original CQT when converted back. The need for this indicates a fundamental flaw in the WaveNet synthesizer. The authors explicitly say they did not want to fix the WaveNet algorithm itself. In my view, this is what should have been done. The authors should focus much more on how to achieve sufficient WaveNet synthesis quality. This should be the main bulk of the paper, and would be a requirement for me to accept the paper. So overall, the paper feels a little too much of combining black boxes. In terms of significance, I would not think that this paper is getting near solving this problem, hence I rate it of less significance in the current state of results. Pros: - interesting idea - reasonable approach by combining existing building blocks Cons: - too much focus on STFT vs. CQT - too little focus on getting WaveNet synthesis right - too limited experimental validation (too restricted choice of instruments) - poor resulting audio quality - feels too much of combining black boxes As a result I rate the paper \"not good enough\" in its current form.

It has allowed us to greatly improve our work and our paper . We hope the revised draft of the paper with the clarifications and improvements made below serve to increase your rating of our work . 1.In choosing a CQT rather than STFT representation , we agree that , devoid of any other context , such a choice might indeed not be contentious , especially from a signal processing perspective . But the context here is that we are not just using this for discrimination or analysis purposes , but optimizing reconstruction is also essential : since Griffin-Lim is not possible for CQT , then in this case , switching from STFT to CQT means that we need to fundamentally change the pipeline . Furthermore , STFT and Grifflin-Lim is still widely used in state of the art speech and music research , for example in Tacotron 2 by Shen et al . ( 2018 ) and Deep Voice 3 by Ping et al . ( 2018 ) . Hence , we needed to demonstrate that the improvement from CQT in this context is significant enough to justify the added complexity of the WaveNet synthesizer . 2.In advance of our experiments , it would certainly be a reasonable conjecture that the spectrogram-shifting trick would work for pitch shifting . But we don \u2019 t think this was so \u201c obvious \u201d as to not require experimental confirmation . 3.Thank you for suggesting the comparison of our pitch shifted samples with PSOLA-based pitch change . We did some PSOLA experiments for baseline to address your concern . The results can be found here : https : //1drv.ms/f/s ! ApC93lRyk9iagZ5pKpRLdBcdJ1xJbw As you can see , PSOLA performs well on simple samples , like notes_shifted.wav However , it completely fails on more complicated monophonic samples . We think that \u2019 s due to the fact that for PSOLA to work well , fundamental frequency needs to be precisely detected , which itself is not a trivial task for a complex monophonic musical piece . We haven \u2019 t put this in the paper yet because we are not sure this is a proper baseline and we are still working on better baseline comparison , and will add the comparison on to paper later . 4.We did in fact run more than two instrument pairs , and we encourage you to take a look at the example outputs we provided in the OneDrive folder , as well as our final demo video ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=aT4D4mTITko ) . In the OneDrive folder Section 7 ( which corresponds to the Section 7.Conclusion of the paper ) , we also included Violin to Flute and Piano to Violin in our original submission . ( The main obstacle to reporting more instrument pairs was simply the computational cost of training additional CycleGANs ; our computational resources were much more limited than some prominent groups publishing on deep learning for music . ) The idea of this work is not to develop a commercial level product for artists , but rather we are only aiming at empirically verifying that our methodology is a practical approach to the problem of Timbre Transfer , a proof of concept . But we agree that the more instrument pairs the better , thus in this folder : https : //1drv.ms/f/s ! ApC93lRyk9iagZ5M91jko9nSAiYMiA , we also included some samples of Violin - > Piano ( Sample 19 ) and Harpsichord - > Piano ( Samples 16 and 18 ) and Piano - > Flute ( sample 17 ) . The latter is a particularly interesting failure case where TimbreTron dreamed up all the \u201c piano vibrato \u201d from the long notes in the source flute sample .

These are indeed interesting cases where it \u2019 s ambiguous what the \u201c correct \u201d mapping is . Because TimbreTron does not simulate the physics of the instruments , it sometimes transfers effects that would be impossible or unusual for the target instrument . We highlighted two such examples in our demo video : a crescendo on a sustained piano note , and a string ensemble pausing to breathe . In the context of TimbreTron , we consider these to be interesting artifacts . If one wants to build a commercial system to produce convincing instrument samples , one would want to somehow remove these artifacts . ( On the other hand , they might be beneficial , insofar as they enable a broader range of expression in the target instrument , as was the case for our generated harpsichord for the Moonlight Sonata . ) ( due to characters limit , more response will follow in the next post ) ..."}, {"review_id": "S1lvm305YQ-1", "review_text": "Main Idea: The authors use multiple techniques/tools to enable neural timbre transfer (converting music from one instrument to another, ex: violin to flute) without paired training examples. The authors are inspired by the success of CycleGANs for image style transfer, and by the success of Wavenet for generating realistic audio waveforms. Even without the CycleGAN, the use of CQT->WaveNet for time stretching and pitch shifting of a single piece is an interesting and valuable contribution. Methodology: Figure 1 captures the overall timbre-conversion methodology concisely. In general the details of the methodology look sound. The lengthy appendices offer additional implementation details, but without access to a source code repository, it is hard to say if the results are perfectly reproducible. Experiment and Results: Measuring the quality of generated audio is challenging. To do so, subjective listening tests are conducted on Amazon mechanical turk, but without a comparison to a baseline system except for another performance of the target piece. Note that there are few published timbre-transfer methods (see Similar Work). One issue with the AMT survey is that the total number of workers is not reported, and as such the significance of the results can be questioned. Significance: In my mind, the paper offers validation of the three techniques used. CycleGANs, originally designed for images, are shown to work for style transfers on audio spectrograms. Wavenet's claim to be a generic technique for audio generation is tested and validated for this domain (CQT spectrogram to audio). That CQT outperforms STFT on musical data seems to be a well established result already, but this offers further validation. This paper also offers practical advice for adapting the techniques/tools (Wavenet, CycleGAN, CQT) to the timbre-transfer task.

The proposed method uses constant-Q transform magnitudes as the input representation, transfers between domains (timbres) by a CycleGAN-like architecture, and resynthesizes the generated CQT representation by a modified WaveNET-like decoder. The system is evaluated by human (mechanical turk) listening studies, and the results indicate that the proposed system is effective for pitch and tempo transfer, as well as timbre adaptation. High-level comments ------------------- This paper is extremely well written, and the authors clearly have a great attention to detail in both the audio processing and machine learning domains. Each of the modifications to prior work was well motivated, and the ablation study at the end, while briefly presented, provides a good sense of the contributions of each piece. I was unable to listen to the examples provided by the link in section 6, which requires a Microsoft OneDrive login to access. However, the youtube link provided in the ICLR comments gave a reasonable sample of the results of the system. Overall, the outputs sound compelling, and match my expectations given the reported results of the listening studies. On the quantitative side, it would have been nice to see a measurement of phase retrieval of the decoder component, which could be done in isolation from the transfer components by feeding in original CQT magnitudes. This might help give a sense of how well the model can be expected to perform, particular as it breaks down along target timbres. I would expect some timbres to be easier to model than others, and having a quantitative handle on that could help put the listener study in a bit more perspective. Detailed comments ----------------- The paper contains numerous typos and grammatical quirks, e.g.: - page 5: \"GP can stable GAN training\" - page 7: \"CQT is equivalent to pitch\" The reverse-generation trick in section 3.2 was clever!

GP means Gradient Penalty ; sorry for not writing down the abbreviation in the first place , it is now fixed . As for quantitative measurement of phase retrieval of the decoder component , we will include qualitative comparison of rainbowgram ( which encodes phase information with color ) of the source audio and the wavenet reconstruction ( wavenet ( CQT ( source audio ) ) and you can find the samples here : https : //1drv.ms/f/s ! ApC93lRyk9iagZ5NBNV_ERqOJFK_3w . The reason why we don \u2019 t think in our particular case that quantitative measurement can provide much insight in this regard is because phase retrieval is neither the focus nor a sub-goal of our work : so if , for example , our system produces an output that 's shifted by some number of time steps , it would be a perfectly good output , even though the phases are all completely wrong . We apologize for the complexity of listening to samples via OneDrive\u2026 In testing it anonymously in advance , we did not have any of these errors , so we did not anticipate such a problem .

However, the youtube link provided in the ICLR comments gave a reasonable sample of the results of the system. Overall, the outputs sound compelling, and match my expectations given the reported results of the listening studies. On the quantitative side, it would have been nice to see a measurement of phase retrieval of the decoder component, which could be done in isolation from the transfer components by feeding in original CQT magnitudes. This might help give a sense of how well the model can be expected to perform, particular as it breaks down along target timbres. I would expect some timbres to be easier to model than others, and having a quantitative handle on that could help put the listener study in a bit more perspective. Detailed comments ----------------- The paper contains numerous typos and grammatical quirks, e.g.: - page 5: \"GP can stable GAN training\" - page 7: \"CQT is equivalent to pitch\" The reverse-generation trick in section 3.2 was clever! ", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "reply_text": "Thanks for catching the typos ! They are now fixed . GP means Gradient Penalty ; sorry for not writing down the abbreviation in the first place , it is now fixed . As for quantitative measurement of phase retrieval of the decoder component , we will include qualitative comparison of rainbowgram ( which encodes phase information with color ) of the source audio and the wavenet reconstruction ( wavenet ( CQT ( source audio ) ) and you can find the samples here : https : //1drv.ms/f/s ! ApC93lRyk9iagZ5NBNV_ERqOJFK_3w . The reason why we don \u2019 t think in our particular case that quantitative measurement can provide much insight in this regard is because phase retrieval is neither the focus nor a sub-goal of our work : so if , for example , our system produces an output that 's shifted by some number of time steps , it would be a perfectly good output , even though the phases are all completely wrong . We apologize for the complexity of listening to samples via OneDrive\u2026 In testing it anonymously in advance , we did not have any of these errors , so we did not anticipate such a problem . We are glad you were able to access the youtube link , and we are in the progress of making a project page for our camera ready version , and by then it should be easier to go through all the samples ."}}
