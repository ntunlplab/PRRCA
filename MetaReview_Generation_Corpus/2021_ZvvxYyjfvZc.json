It is interesting how differently you have interpreted our work than what we thought its message was . Our primary goal was not to \u201c extend \u201d momentum for TD , after all , virtually every deep RL paper already uses an optimizer with momentum , rather , our goal was to argue that these deep RL papers were using momentum _incorrectly_ , and that it is possible to correct it by taking into account the nature of TD learning . As you point out , there are already many momentum-like methods for TD , eligibility traces and related methods ( discussed at length in appendix A ) , but these are restricted to the linear setting , including the work of Sun et al.The novel claim we make is not that of \u201c using momentum for TD learning \u201d , this has been done for a very long time , but rather that in the non-linear ( deep ) case there are particularly useful corrections to be made that arise from staleness ( itself arising from interference , an important phenomenon in deep nets ) . 1. \u201c Can the authors provide some more citations to support this besides the 1-d regression task \u201d , Figure 2 shows the effect of our proposed method on an SVHN classifier , and shows that even the oracle has little to no effect . Additionally , momentum in the supervised setting is usually viewed as benefiting from this bias ( what we call staleness ) . This bias is actually useful in that it performs some kind of local ensemble averaging which smooths the optimization landscape . This analogy does not hold in TD where said landscape changes as the target changes . \u201c How do we know that we can safely ignore these for large networks ? \u201d , it is true that we may be missing valuable information , but consider that using the outer product approximation of the Hessians yields performance relatively close to the oracle , meaning that not much information is lost . 2.The Deadly Triad suggests that some settings , especially in the deep case , are bound to diverge . We did not rigorously test this , but such diverging settings seem to diverge , momentum or not , Adam or not . Instead what we find is that for settings that would converge with SGD ( no-momentum ) , using momentum or Adam simply speeds up convergence . This was especially visible in Atari where learning rates can be an issue for convergence . 3. \u201c maybe the authors can have the MSE plot for just Adam updates for a better comparison ? \u201d , perhaps we should make this clearer , in Figure 9 the Baseline line is just Adam . Or did you mean something else ? 4.This is a fair criticism , we have added Figure 18 in the appendix for mountain car , and can add more . Extending the figures to include more steps simply shows gradual convergence over time . 5.This is also a fair criticism of no-target momentum methods , there is some inherent instability that ( it seems ) can only be resolved by decreasing learning rates or freezing the target network , but note that the X axis of Figure 17 spans 500k steps , 50 times the standard bootstrapping time of DQN . One thing we \u2019 ve found is that while our method is more precise in the short term , _it does not change the ordering of actions_ , even compared to frozen-target DQN . That means that if an agent quickly identifies the optimal action it doesn \u2019 t matter how precise the underlying value estimation is , their performance in terms of reward will be the same . We believe our contribution is fundamentally to show that _deep_ RL methods are using momentum incorrectly , because the underlying assumptions of the supervised setting no longer hold . We find surprising the qualification of this work as incrementally building upon works such as that of Sun et al , since these are not the basis upon which this work is founded , as the linear framework of RL is quite limiting . Instead , we depart from Deep RL methods , pointing out a shared weakness , and providing a potential solution ."}, {"review_id": "ZvvxYyjfvZc-1", "review_text": "This paper proposes a modification to momentum . Extra terms are added to account for the drift in parameters through the gradient updates that contribute to the momentum . The effect of this modification is studied on supervised learning and TD learning and on different representations . The conclusion is that while the original momentum is good enough for supervised learning , this modification matters when there is bootstrapping , especially on representations with high interference . Overall , the empirical study highlights a direction for improving TD learning and the experiments are diverse and conclusive . Although the proposed approximations to the extra terms show limited improvement , experiments show that if the extra terms can be approximated more accurately , there will be a considerable gain . Computing the extra terms exactly is computationally expensive but it is possible that better approximations will be introduced later on . There are a few weaknesses that I describe below . 1.There is little discussion on why we would want to account for the drift in parameters in momentum .

On weaknesses : 1 . Discussion on drift : this is mostly discussed at the end of section 1.2 , as well as throughout the exposition of experimental results , but indeed is a bit lacking . When we point out that momentum staleness ( caused by drift ) incurs bias , we imply that this bias adds to the biases of TD , which are commonly understood to slow down convergence or even cause divergence . Thus , reducing this bias should improve the rate of convergence . We will make this explicit . 2.Learning rates : We have run more experiments and reported the results in a new appendix figure , Figure 19 . We note that the differences between algorithms have been consistent even if we select each method \u2019 s optimal learning rate . 3.In our initial exploratory testing of this method we tried a variety of simple functions for supervised learning which all had the same behaviour , we could include these results explicitly in the appendix .

The two concerns we understand you have is that this method does not scale and that the paper needs more investigations . We address the first below , and note that the suggested investigations already appear in the paper , albeit in the appendix . - Oracle computation : the oracle is included in experiments as a reference point of the \u201c best possible \u201d scenario . The oracle represents what our method would be like if the Taylor approximation was perfect , it is not meant to be compared in wall-time to other methods or prior work , nor do we recommend using the oracle practically . This is purely a scientific tool . - This effective horizon formula is commonly used in RL , and indeed does come from the geometric series . Again , since the oracle exists for purely illustrative and comparative reasons , simply choosing a \u201c long enough \u201d horizon is what matters , we could have just as well chosen $ h=512 $ out of convenience . - On scalability : It is fair to point out that the method we propose is computationally expensive , but in writing this paper we also wanted to invite the reader to take a step back , by pointing out that \u201c deep RL methods are not always best served by directly importing techniques from the supervised setting. \u201d By showing the existence of such an inconsistency , we hope to encourage deep RL researchers to consider what ( possibly wrong ) assumptions they are ( re ) using from supervised learning through their tools -- perhaps more than we hope deep RL researchers are going to adopt the particular method we propose . \u201c The most important question about this work is its scalability \u201d , we would respectfully disagree , progress in machine learning is not only done by proposing new methods , but also by understanding existing methods and their weaknesses . An important question about any scientific work is , what does it teach us ? In this work we provide evidence of a previously unreported phenomenon . We do propose _a_ method to combat this phenomenon , but it would vain of us to claim victory over it ; we certainly hope that future methods will be able to address this with better tools than Taylor expansions . - \u201c authors have not used frozen targets , which seems to be misleading when it comes to the experiments and results . It would be useful to see a comparison between these two approaches since they try to solve a similar problem. \u201d We did run frozen target experiments , please refer to Figure 16 and 17 for such results . They show that the use of frozen targets considerably slows down learning . - \u201c Here the term multiplying \u2206\u03b8 is not exactly the Hessian\u2026 \u201d , what the rest of this sentence in the paper explains is this : the Hessian is the second derivative of the loss $ \\delta^2 $ , but that this is not what we want so we must be careful . In $ \\delta^2 $ , $ V_\\theta ( s \u2019 ) $ is held constant , but since we update $ \\theta $ , then $ V_\\theta $ is going to change . Since we care about how the _gradient_ $ g $ changes , rather than how $ \\delta^2 $ changes , and that $ g $ depends on $ V_\\theta ( s \u2019 ) $ , then when computing the derivative of the $ g $ we must take $ V_\\theta ( s \u2019 ) $ into account rather than holding it constant ( which taking the second derivative of $ \\delta^2 $ would ) . We will attempt to make this more explicit in the paper ."}, {"review_id": "ZvvxYyjfvZc-3", "review_text": "The paper studies the approach to 'correct the bias ' of momentum in supervised learning and reinforcement learning ( especially , in the temporal-difference algorithm ) . The proposed approach can maintain a moving average of the 'correct ' gradient direction over past objective functions via extra updates . And the experiments show that it does speed up the convergence . ( ps : I did not find the comparisons over the loss functions at the stationary points ) . As we know TD learning uses a semi/partial/biased gradient with respect to the mean square Bellman error . Thus , the effect of applying momentum to training is an open question . I feel very glad to see such a paper studying it and adding a reasonable modification . The approach averages the TD update over different steps via a modified momentum update . Such an approach reduces the variance , which is usually very large in TD , but also uses additional computational power . I found the motivation not very convincing for me . The paper seems to claim that a good momentum should carry the information of past objective function and calculate their gradients only with respect to the parameter in the current iterate . However , momentum terms do have the reason to use the gradient wrt previous parameters , as it can speed up the convergence in many situations , e.g.ravines.Another concern is that TD is not typically an online learning problem . The objective function in the early phase is not informative to the update in the later phases as the values of the next states are inaccurate . Therefore , I feel the theoretical reason for 'correcting ' the 'bias ' , which is defined by this paper , is not warranted very well . I suggest the paper to rigorously discuss more on why such 'bias ' has to be corrected . Alternatively , the proposed method is designed simply for the purpose of reducing the variance of the stochastic gradient for the case of minibatch update . But the paper needs to argue how it is better than using a larger batch or compare itself with other variance reduction approaches .", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "Thank you for your comments . It is indeed on us to explain our motivation better . In this case we respectfully believe that you may not have understood the text correctly , so we will work to make this part clearer . We offer a more complete explanation below by pointing out where we believe there are misunderstandings . We hope it is clearer and that you will find that our work is well motivated . - On loss at stationary points , in classical environments all the methods seem to converge to the same result . We have added a new figure , Figure 18 , which shows longer training . - \u201c momentum should carry the information of past objective function \u201d , for TD , that is not quite what we claim , we claim that momentum does carry the information of past _states_ ( and their gradients ) but that as it is , it carries the _wrong_ information about the past objective function , since that objective function has changed ( and we propose a correction to this ) . - \u201c momentum terms do have the reason to use the gradient wrt previous parameters , as it can speed up the convergence in many situations \u201d This conjecture is probably true when the loss landscape is constant , as in supervised learning , but in TD the loss landscape changes at every iteration . Since this conjecture has , to the best of our knowledge , not been proved for stochastic gradient momentum supervised learning , it is not clear that there is a good framework to think about it in the case of an evolving loss landscape , nor that it should readily apply to TD . - \u201c Another concern is that TD is not typically an online learning problem \u201d . Our proposed method is agnostic of the data distribution , online or not , in fact we show improvements for both the online case and the offline replay-buffer case ( Figures 3 and 4 ) . - \u201c The objective function in the early phase is not informative to the update in the later phases as the values of the next states are inaccurate. \u201d This is _precisely_ what our method aims to correct . The gradients accumulated in momentum contain information about the \u201c values of next states \u201d which is not informative ( since it is inaccurate , since parameters change ) . Our proposed method corrects those gradients so that they reflect the latest predictions of the \u201c value of next states \u201d and become accurate . - \u201c the paper needs to argue how it is better than using a larger batch or compare itself with other variance reduction approaches. \u201d That is a fair point , the effect of our method indeed lessens as the batch size grows ( see Figure 10 ) , but using a large batch size is not always possible ( e.g.for online learning ) or desirable ( large batches are associated with overfitting in deep learning literature ) . Furthermore , using a large batch does not negate the evolution of the loss landscape due to bootstrapping in TD ( which we refer to as value drift ) . This evolution induces staleness when using momentum , and can still be compensated for via our method , since it exists regardless of batch size ."}], "0": {"review_id": "ZvvxYyjfvZc-0", "review_text": "Summary : This paper extends the idea of momentum , commonly used in optimization literature , to Temporal Difference ( TD ) learning which is a widely used algorithm for policy evaluation in Reinforcement learning literature .

The two concerns we understand you have is that this method does not scale and that the paper needs more investigations . We address the first below , and note that the suggested investigations already appear in the paper , albeit in the appendix . - Oracle computation : the oracle is included in experiments as a reference point of the \u201c best possible \u201d scenario . The oracle represents what our method would be like if the Taylor approximation was perfect , it is not meant to be compared in wall-time to other methods or prior work , nor do we recommend using the oracle practically . This is purely a scientific tool . - This effective horizon formula is commonly used in RL , and indeed does come from the geometric series . Again , since the oracle exists for purely illustrative and comparative reasons , simply choosing a \u201c long enough \u201d horizon is what matters , we could have just as well chosen $ h=512 $ out of convenience . - On scalability : It is fair to point out that the method we propose is computationally expensive , but in writing this paper we also wanted to invite the reader to take a step back , by pointing out that \u201c deep RL methods are not always best served by directly importing techniques from the supervised setting. \u201d By showing the existence of such an inconsistency , we hope to encourage deep RL researchers to consider what ( possibly wrong ) assumptions they are ( re ) using from supervised learning through their tools -- perhaps more than we hope deep RL researchers are going to adopt the particular method we propose . \u201c The most important question about this work is its scalability \u201d , we would respectfully disagree , progress in machine learning is not only done by proposing new methods , but also by understanding existing methods and their weaknesses . An important question about any scientific work is , what does it teach us ? In this work we provide evidence of a previously unreported phenomenon . We do propose _a_ method to combat this phenomenon , but it would vain of us to claim victory over it ; we certainly hope that future methods will be able to address this with better tools than Taylor expansions . - \u201c authors have not used frozen targets , which seems to be misleading when it comes to the experiments and results . It would be useful to see a comparison between these two approaches since they try to solve a similar problem. \u201d We did run frozen target experiments , please refer to Figure 16 and 17 for such results . They show that the use of frozen targets considerably slows down learning . - \u201c Here the term multiplying \u2206\u03b8 is not exactly the Hessian\u2026 \u201d , what the rest of this sentence in the paper explains is this : the Hessian is the second derivative of the loss $ \\delta^2 $ , but that this is not what we want so we must be careful . In $ \\delta^2 $ , $ V_\\theta ( s \u2019 ) $ is held constant , but since we update $ \\theta $ , then $ V_\\theta $ is going to change . Since we care about how the _gradient_ $ g $ changes , rather than how $ \\delta^2 $ changes , and that $ g $ depends on $ V_\\theta ( s \u2019 ) $ , then when computing the derivative of the $ g $ we must take $ V_\\theta ( s \u2019 ) $ into account rather than holding it constant ( which taking the second derivative of $ \\delta^2 $ would ) . We will attempt to make this more explicit in the paper ."}, "3": {"review_id": "ZvvxYyjfvZc-3", "review_text": "The paper studies the approach to 'correct the bias ' of momentum in supervised learning and reinforcement learning ( especially , in the temporal-difference algorithm ) . The proposed approach can maintain a moving average of the 'correct ' gradient direction over past objective functions via extra updates . And the experiments show that it does speed up the convergence . ( ps : I did not find the comparisons over the loss functions at the stationary points ) . As we know TD learning uses a semi/partial/biased gradient with respect to the mean square Bellman error . Thus , the effect of applying momentum to training is an open question . I feel very glad to see such a paper studying it and adding a reasonable modification . The approach averages the TD update over different steps via a modified momentum update . Such an approach reduces the variance , which is usually very large in TD , but also uses additional computational power . I found the motivation not very convincing for me . The paper seems to claim that a good momentum should carry the information of past objective function and calculate their gradients only with respect to the parameter in the current iterate . However , momentum terms do have the reason to use the gradient wrt previous parameters , as it can speed up the convergence in many situations , e.g.ravines.Another concern is that TD is not typically an online learning problem . The objective function in the early phase is not informative to the update in the later phases as the values of the next states are inaccurate . Therefore , I feel the theoretical reason for 'correcting ' the 'bias ' , which is defined by this paper , is not warranted very well . I suggest the paper to rigorously discuss more on why such 'bias ' has to be corrected . Alternatively , the proposed method is designed simply for the purpose of reducing the variance of the stochastic gradient for the case of minibatch update . But the paper needs to argue how it is better than using a larger batch or compare itself with other variance reduction approaches .", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "Thank you for your comments . It is indeed on us to explain our motivation better . In this case we respectfully believe that you may not have understood the text correctly , so we will work to make this part clearer . We offer a more complete explanation below by pointing out where we believe there are misunderstandings . We hope it is clearer and that you will find that our work is well motivated . - On loss at stationary points , in classical environments all the methods seem to converge to the same result . We have added a new figure , Figure 18 , which shows longer training . - \u201c momentum should carry the information of past objective function \u201d , for TD , that is not quite what we claim , we claim that momentum does carry the information of past _states_ ( and their gradients ) but that as it is , it carries the _wrong_ information about the past objective function , since that objective function has changed ( and we propose a correction to this ) . - \u201c momentum terms do have the reason to use the gradient wrt previous parameters , as it can speed up the convergence in many situations \u201d This conjecture is probably true when the loss landscape is constant , as in supervised learning , but in TD the loss landscape changes at every iteration . Since this conjecture has , to the best of our knowledge , not been proved for stochastic gradient momentum supervised learning , it is not clear that there is a good framework to think about it in the case of an evolving loss landscape , nor that it should readily apply to TD . - \u201c Another concern is that TD is not typically an online learning problem \u201d . Our proposed method is agnostic of the data distribution , online or not , in fact we show improvements for both the online case and the offline replay-buffer case ( Figures 3 and 4 ) . - \u201c The objective function in the early phase is not informative to the update in the later phases as the values of the next states are inaccurate. \u201d This is _precisely_ what our method aims to correct . The gradients accumulated in momentum contain information about the \u201c values of next states \u201d which is not informative ( since it is inaccurate , since parameters change ) . Our proposed method corrects those gradients so that they reflect the latest predictions of the \u201c value of next states \u201d and become accurate . - \u201c the paper needs to argue how it is better than using a larger batch or compare itself with other variance reduction approaches. \u201d That is a fair point , the effect of our method indeed lessens as the batch size grows ( see Figure 10 ) , but using a large batch size is not always possible ( e.g.for online learning ) or desirable ( large batches are associated with overfitting in deep learning literature ) . Furthermore , using a large batch does not negate the evolution of the loss landscape due to bootstrapping in TD ( which we refer to as value drift ) . This evolution induces staleness when using momentum , and can still be compensated for via our method , since it exists regardless of batch size ."}}
