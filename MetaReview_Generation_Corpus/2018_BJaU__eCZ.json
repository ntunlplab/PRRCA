The contribution seems to mix two objectives: on one hand to prove that it is possible to do data augmentation for fMRI brain decoding, on the other hand to design (or better to extend) a new model (to be more precise two models). Concerning the first objective the empirical results do not provide meaningful support that the generative model is really effective. The improvement is really tiny and a statistical test (not included in the analysis) probably wouldn't pass a significant threshold. This analysis is missing a straw man. It is not clear whether the difference in the evaluation measures is related to the greater number of examples or by the specific generative model. Concerning the contribution of the model, one novelty is the conditional formulation of the discriminator. The design of the empirical evaluation doesn't address the analysis of the impact of this new formulation. It is not clear whether the supposed improvement is related to the conditional formulation.

The pairwise brain maps would support the interpretation of the generated data. It is worthwhile to remember that the location of brain activations is crucial to detect whether the brain decoding (classification) relies on artifacts or confounds.
