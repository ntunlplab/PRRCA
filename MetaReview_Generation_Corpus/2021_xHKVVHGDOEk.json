Below we summarize our responses : - \u201c The \u2018 retraining \u2019 phase to get the ground truth seems like an interesting idea ... The paper fails to clarify why such an approximation will provide any insights on the performance of neural networks . Including a summary , and intuition of the approach will be helpful to the reader \u201d : To evaluate the ground-truth influence estimates , re-training from optimal model parameters is a proposal which we borrow from [ 1 ] . Note that training from scratch to obtain the ground-truths even for small models and datasets is very computationally expensive , that is why such an approximation is proposed in the literature . To further validate the approach followed by [ 1 ] , we carried out two new experiments : ( a ) For a 4-layered shallow network trained on Iris , we observe that both training from scratch and re-training from optimal model parameters lead to similar correlation estimates across different initialisations ( See Fig.5 ( b ) ) .We also compute the norm of the difference in parameters obtained by training from scratch vs. re-training from optimal model parameters as suggested by [ 1 ] . For the same network trained on Iris , we observe that the norm of the difference in parameters is relatively small ( in the order of $ e^ { -7 } $ ) across different training samples ( See Fig.5 ( a ) ) . ( b ) Similarly for a CNN architecture ( with depth 6 ) trained on MNIST , the norm of the difference in parameters is also small and is of the order of $ e^ { -6 } $ ( See Fig.14 - Appendix ) . These results highlight that re-training from optimal parameters ( although an approximation ) is indeed close to training from scratch but saves substantially in terms of running time . The impact of a training sample on the model is often understood with an answer to the counterfactual question : \u201c How would the model change if a certain training sample was excluded ? \u201d . The answer to this counterfactual question leads to a fine-grained understanding of model behaviour and its performance [ 1,2,3 ] . Training a model from scratch ( although prohibitively expensive ) by excluding a particular training sample is one way to answer this counterfactual . In our new experiments , we validate that re-training from optimal parameters ( as proposed in [ 1 ] ) closely approximates training the model from scratch , thus answering the same counterfactual question which provides insights into the model performance . - \u201c Most of the neural networks used have a relu activations ( with linear layers ) , making them a piecewise linear function with respect to the parameters , more importantly , nonsmooth .

Below we summarize our responses : - \u201c I would have loved to see some more discussion on why weight decay led to improved influence estimates \u201d : In our experiments , we observe that for deeper networks where the quality of influence estimation is inferior , a high-value of weight-decay helps . In those networks , a relatively high-value of weight-decay decreases the curvature values of the loss function ( therefore reduces the Taylor \u2019 s approximation gap in influence estimation ) and improves the quality of influence estimates . We have updated the paper adding this new experiment ( on the Iris dataset ) and this additional discussion ( See Sec 3-Appendix ) . - \u201c Do you intend to release the code for all experiments \u201d : Yes ! we are working on making our codebase user-friendly and will release the code by the end of the review period . - \u201c Can you provide intuition or details for how to scale influence to larger networks ? \u201d : Improving and scaling influence estimates for large overparameterized networks is an important research direction . In our work , we observe that a high value of loss curvature reduces the quality of influence estimates , especially for deeper networks . While outside the scope of the current paper , we propose to train deep networks with curvature regularization in the parameter space to improve influence estimates in deeper models ( by reducing the Taylor \u2019 s approximation gap in influence estimation ) . - \u201c Did you ever run group influence estimation ? \u201d : Influence estimation for groups , especially in the non-convex regime is indeed a challenging problem . ( First-order ) influence functions assume that the changes in the model on up-weighting a training example is infinitesimal [ 1,2 ] . However , in the case of up-weighting a group ( instead of a single sample ) , the model perturbation is substantially large . Upon your suggestion , we have conducted new experiments on group influence estimation using the method proposed by [ 2 ] on Iris , MNIST and CIFAR-100 . In our new experiments , we observe that for small networks where the exact Hessian matrix can be computed , group influence is fairly accurate for small group sizes . However , even for small models , group influence estimates are inaccurate for large group sizes where the perturbation to the model is considerably large . For large overparameterized networks , we notice that the group influence estimations are still erroneous for both small and large groups . We have updated the paper with the additional experiments on group influence ( See Sec 12 - Appendix ) . - \u201c Providing theoretical intuitions for the observed phenomena would strengthen the paper 's findings . I.e.does overparameterization always lead to imprecise influence estimates \u201d : We agree that understanding the theoretical underpinnings behind the observations in our paper is an extremely interesting and important research direction . While our paper is empirical , we do provide some intuitions about why influence estimates are erroneous for certain networks ( e.g.importance of the Taylor \u2019 s approximation gap ) . To further understand if overparameterization leads to imprecise influence estimates , we perform an additional experiment . We take a simple one-layered network and increase its width gradually from 8 to 300 . We observe that the correlations decrease from 0.8 to 0.18 ( Fig.15 - Appendix ) , which indeed points to the fact that overparameterization plays an important role in controlling the quality of influence estimates .

Influence functions allow one to estimate the effect of weighting a training point at test time ( for instance , dropping a training point from the training set with a weight of $ \\frac { -1 } { n } $ under assumptions about the convexity of the loss function and the models Hessian $ H_ { \\theta } $ .The authors note that successful applications of influence functions are rare in the literature , despite their potential applications . The authors investigate the effects of model width , depth , regularization schedule , Hessian approximation techniques , and dataset size on the accuracy of influence functions . In general , they find that each of these can cause issues with influence function calculation . As model width and depth increases , the Spearman correlation decreases between the calculated influence functions and the ground truth obtained by retraining . They also find that the top eigenvalue of $ H_\\theta $ increases quite dramatically as depth increases . Weight regularization was found to be important for successful influence functions calculation , while factors such as the huge size of the ImageNet dataset proved prohibitive at this point .

We further investigated the quality of influence estimates for CIFAR-100 . This is a more challenging dataset than CIFAR-10 , but less complex than ImageNet-1000 , both for which we have presented results in the paper . With ResNet-18 , when trained with a weight-decay factor of 0.0005 , across multiple test-points and initialisations , we find that the influence estimates have poor quality . This is similar to our observations with ImageNet , thus holding up the fragile notion of influence functions especially for large models and datasets . In the case of CIFAR-100 , for certain test-points , we notice inconsistencies in the semantic similarity of the top influential points to the given test-point ( similar to our observations with CIFAR-10 and ImageNet experimental results ) .

However influence estimates for the training samples with the lowest influential scores are poor ( i.e.low correlation with the respective ground-truths ) . For the lowest influential training samples , we observe that the influence estimates suffer from large approximation errors and are of the order of 1e-7 , in contrast to the ground-truth estimates which are of the order of 1e-3 .

Below we summarize our responses : - \u201c I would have loved to see some more discussion on why weight decay led to improved influence estimates \u201d : In our experiments , we observe that for deeper networks where the quality of influence estimation is inferior , a high-value of weight-decay helps . In those networks , a relatively high-value of weight-decay decreases the curvature values of the loss function ( therefore reduces the Taylor \u2019 s approximation gap in influence estimation ) and improves the quality of influence estimates . We have updated the paper adding this new experiment ( on the Iris dataset ) and this additional discussion ( See Sec 3-Appendix ) . - \u201c Do you intend to release the code for all experiments \u201d : Yes ! we are working on making our codebase user-friendly and will release the code by the end of the review period . - \u201c Can you provide intuition or details for how to scale influence to larger networks ? \u201d : Improving and scaling influence estimates for large overparameterized networks is an important research direction . In our work , we observe that a high value of loss curvature reduces the quality of influence estimates , especially for deeper networks . While outside the scope of the current paper , we propose to train deep networks with curvature regularization in the parameter space to improve influence estimates in deeper models ( by reducing the Taylor \u2019 s approximation gap in influence estimation ) . - \u201c Did you ever run group influence estimation ? \u201d : Influence estimation for groups , especially in the non-convex regime is indeed a challenging problem . ( First-order ) influence functions assume that the changes in the model on up-weighting a training example is infinitesimal [ 1,2 ] . However , in the case of up-weighting a group ( instead of a single sample ) , the model perturbation is substantially large . Upon your suggestion , we have conducted new experiments on group influence estimation using the method proposed by [ 2 ] on Iris , MNIST and CIFAR-100 . In our new experiments , we observe that for small networks where the exact Hessian matrix can be computed , group influence is fairly accurate for small group sizes . However , even for small models , group influence estimates are inaccurate for large group sizes where the perturbation to the model is considerably large . For large overparameterized networks , we notice that the group influence estimations are still erroneous for both small and large groups . We have updated the paper with the additional experiments on group influence ( See Sec 12 - Appendix ) . - \u201c Providing theoretical intuitions for the observed phenomena would strengthen the paper 's findings . I.e.does overparameterization always lead to imprecise influence estimates \u201d : We agree that understanding the theoretical underpinnings behind the observations in our paper is an extremely interesting and important research direction . While our paper is empirical , we do provide some intuitions about why influence estimates are erroneous for certain networks ( e.g.importance of the Taylor \u2019 s approximation gap ) . To further understand if overparameterization leads to imprecise influence estimates , we perform an additional experiment . We take a simple one-layered network and increase its width gradually from 8 to 300 . We observe that the correlations decrease from 0.8 to 0.18 ( Fig.15 - Appendix ) , which indeed points to the fact that overparameterization plays an important role in controlling the quality of influence estimates .

Influence functions allow one to estimate the effect of weighting a training point at test time ( for instance , dropping a training point from the training set with a weight of $ \\frac { -1 } { n } $ under assumptions about the convexity of the loss function and the models Hessian $ H_ { \\theta } $ .The authors note that successful applications of influence functions are rare in the literature , despite their potential applications . The authors investigate the effects of model width , depth , regularization schedule , Hessian approximation techniques , and dataset size on the accuracy of influence functions . In general , they find that each of these can cause issues with influence function calculation . As model width and depth increases , the Spearman correlation decreases between the calculated influence functions and the ground truth obtained by retraining . They also find that the top eigenvalue of $ H_\\theta $ increases quite dramatically as depth increases . Weight regularization was found to be important for successful influence functions calculation , while factors such as the huge size of the ImageNet dataset proved prohibitive at this point . Strengths : * The paper has excellent presentation . The authors establish the background and relevant literature succinctly but with proper depth * I do think that the authors demonstrated that most of the factors they consider do contribute to the difficulty of accurately computing influence functions , but see ( weaknesses ) Weaknesses : * The authors use the term `` significant '' or `` significantly '' 10+ times throughout the paper but I think this word should generally be reserved for when a test of statistical significance is performed .

I rate it a 6 on this basis .", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We thank the reviewer for the insightful comments .

The authors suggest that the estimation via influence functions can be quite fragile depending on various architectures of neural networks . To point out such information , approximation with inverse-Hessian Vector product techniques might be incorrect , which leads to low quality influence estimates . They show several meaningful findings which address the true nature of using influence functions in deep neural networks . One of their findings through various experimental study is that the network depth and width strongly affect influence estimates . # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Reasons for score : The introduced through experimental settings seem to be highly interesting and reasonable . I like the idea of addressing weakness of influence functions in deep neural network and the authors \u2019 findings are interesting . I believe it will be better if the authors perform the ablation studies with different parameters and more datasets to generalize their findings . # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Pros : 1 . The paper address the important issue of influence functions , which can affect the field of model interpretability . 2.The introduced experimental settings seem to be reasonable to empirically show that using influence functions in deep neural networks can be very sensitive depending on the architectures of neural networks , the use of weight decay , and the choice of hyper-parameters . 3.The experiments are well designed with multiple architectures of neural networks and detasets . In the case of non-convex loss functions , the assumption of fist-order influence functions is not generally true . They empirically found that the Taylor \u2019 s gap is strongly affected by common hyper-parameters for deep networks . # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Cons : More ablation studies with different set of hyper parameters and multiple datasets can improve the quality of this paper . # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Questions during rebuttal period : In the case study using a CNN architecture on the small MNIST , the authors need to perform the experiments with different number of selected training samples with both the highest and the lowest influence scores to amplify their point . # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Thank you for your detailed comments and positive feedback on the relevance of our work . Below we summarize our responses : - \u201c More ablation studies with different set of hyper parameters and multiple datasets can improve the quality of this paper \u201d : Thank you for the suggestion to include experimental results on more datasets to strengthen our paper . We further investigated the quality of influence estimates for CIFAR-100 . This is a more challenging dataset than CIFAR-10 , but less complex than ImageNet-1000 , both for which we have presented results in the paper . With ResNet-18 , when trained with a weight-decay factor of 0.0005 , across multiple test-points and initialisations , we find that the influence estimates have poor quality . This is similar to our observations with ImageNet , thus holding up the fragile notion of influence functions especially for large models and datasets . In the case of CIFAR-100 , for certain test-points , we notice inconsistencies in the semantic similarity of the top influential points to the given test-point ( similar to our observations with CIFAR-10 and ImageNet experimental results ) . We have included these results along with a discussion in the updated version of the paper ( See Fig.4 , Sec 5.3 ; Section 11 - Appendix ) . - \u201c In the case study using a CNN architecture on the small MNIST , the authors need to perform the experiments with different number of selected training samples with both the highest and the lowest influence scores to amplify their point \u201d : Upon your suggestion , we have added new experiments for the CNN architecture trained on small MNIST with different training samples ( with the highest and lowest influence scores respectively ) . We compute the correlation estimates with the top and the bottom [ 10,20,40,60,80,100,120 ] influential training samples with three different initialisations . We find that the influence estimates for training samples with the highest influence scores are good ( i.e.high correlations with the respective ground-truths ) . However influence estimates for the training samples with the lowest influential scores are poor ( i.e.low correlation with the respective ground-truths ) . For the lowest influential training samples , we observe that the influence estimates suffer from large approximation errors and are of the order of 1e-7 , in contrast to the ground-truth estimates which are of the order of 1e-3 .
