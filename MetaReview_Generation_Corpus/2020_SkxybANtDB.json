The Bayesian approach is very common , what is the highlighted content ? In other problems ( e.g.natural language processing and translation ) , the correspondence between the input/cause series $ x ( i ) $ and the output/effect series $ y ( i ) $ is most often handled using bidirectional approaches or by exploiting the fact that input sentences and output sentences are mapped one-to-one . Bidirectional approaches were not considered due to the intended usage of the model : one only sees the sequence up to now in order to predict the future .

The novelity of the problem posed is that the time lag g(x(t)) is allowed to be non-stationary and supposed to be unknown. The authors outlie a a Bayesian approach.
