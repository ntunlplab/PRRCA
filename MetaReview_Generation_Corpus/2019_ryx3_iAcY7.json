On top of this, the method adds some additional complexity on top of the original model.\n\nGiven that no reviewer was strongly in favor of the paper, I am not going to recommend acceptance at this time.", "reviews": [{"review_id": "ryx3_iAcY7-0", "review_text": " [Summary] This paper proposes a \u201crole interaction layer\u201d (RIL) to capture the context-dependent (latent) role for each token.
