They aim to provide an algorithm that outputs a classifier that minimizes the risk of any group ( of sufficient size ) while at the same time being Pareto efficient . They do this by first showing that this problem is equivalent to the case when there are only two groups and then using no-regret dynamics to provide an algorithm which asymptotically converges to the optimal solution . They also show empirically , using multiple datasets , that their algorithm is marginally better than the state of the art in terms of fairness and in some cases , efficiency . # # Strengths # # This is clearly a very relevant problem since ( as they mention ) in a lot of cases , we may not have the group labels for each point in the dataset . Furthermore , being robust to any subgroup allows for the algorithm to be fair to groups who have not yet been declared as protected groups . The algorithm asymptotically converges to the optimal solution . This algorithm not only minimizes the risk of the worst case group but also does not do any unnecessary harm to other groups while ensuring fairness . The experimental section is very comprehensive and compares their algorithm to the state of the art using multiple datasets . It shows that in almost all of them , their algorithm does marginally better than the state of the art . This section also gives us an idea about the trade-off between efficiency and fairness . Weaknesses : * The improvement over the current state of the art in this problem ( DRO ) is very marginal and in some cases ( the Compas Dataset ) , DRO does slightly better than BPF . * There is no discussion about the result in Lemma 3.3 . It is unclear whether this bound is reasonable or whether the loss in efficiency is significant . * Lastly , in a lot of cases , the accuracy of groups which are not the worst-off group is significantly worse than that of the baseline while the accuracy of the worst off group is only marginally better than that of the baseline . While it is clear that this loss in accuracy is necessary to improve the accuracy of the worst off group , there is very little discussion on why this tradeoff is worth it , or whether there exists another way to address this trade-off . # # Typos # # * Unnecessary Parenthesis around Utsun et al ( 2019 ) ( Introduction ) * $ Y $ should be $ \\mathcal Y $ ( Section 3.1 , Line 6 ) * $ \\Delta^ { |Y| - 1 } $ should be $ \\Delta^ { |Y| } $ ( Section 3.1 ) * $ p ( A = a ) \\ge \\rho $ should be $ p ( A = 1 ) \\ge \\rho $ ( Proof of Lemma 3.1 , Line 6 ) * There is a typo in the equation $ P ( Y|A = 0 , X ) = \\dots $ ( Proof of Lemma 3.2 ) * $ a^ * $ is not defined ( Proof of Lemma 3.3 ) # # Other structural feedback # # The classes of hypothesis functions that can be used is unclear throughout .

BPF and DRO both tackle similar problems , and can indeed be used almost interchangeably to reason about these issues , but the additional Pareto efficiency constraint in BPF ( which is not present in DRO ) ensures that , for any given worst group performance , the BPF risk on the best group is lower or equal than the corresponding risk for DRO .

I think the changes made to the algorithm do seem substantial : you 've changed a complicated combination of multiplicative and best response updates on alpha to a simpler projected gradient update ( I am assuming that the experimental results have also been revised accordingly ) . The description is now easier to follow and the convergence results now follow directly from Chen et al.I 'm raising my score to 6 , but still find the novelty in the formulation to be somewhat limited . One pending concern is that the algorithm maintains one parameter \\alpha_i per training example , which can be prohibitively expensive for large datasets . Of course , one way to alleviate this difficulty would be to replace \\alpha_i with a parameterized function of the features , which however , would make your formulation very similar to Lahoti et al . ( 2020 ) .Is there a way you could measure the violation in the pareto constraint in your experiments , to showcase how the classifiers learned by your method are different from those learned by the approach of Lahoti et al ? * * * * * * The authors seek to learn a classifier which is a pareto-efficient and achieves the min-max risk across different subgroups . They are particularly interested in a setting where neither the group memberships nor the number of groups is known a priori . Prior work by Martinez et al . ( 2020 ) propose an approach for learning min-max pareto fair classifier when the group identities are known beforehand . This paper 's proposal is to formulate a min-max optimization problem : like Martinez et al.the minimization is over the space of pareto-efficient classifiers , whereas the maximization is over all ( soft ) partitions of the data into two groups . The authors show that the solution to this problem degenerates into a trivial classifier when the size of the smallest group is below a certain threshold . They then propose an algorithm inspired from Chen at al . ( NeurIPS 2017 ) to solve the min-max problem . I like the problem formulation and find the problem setup to be practically relevant ( given that there 's an increasing emphasis in the fairness community on addressing scenarios where the protected group information is noisy or unknown ) . However , I 'm unable to verify correctness of algorithm and guarantee - The authors say they adapt Algorithm 3 from Chen at al. , but I find the proposed algorithm to be different from the one in Chen et al.Unfortunately , the textual description does n't delve into any of these differences . I am also unable to see how the no-regret guarantee the authors provide in Lemma 4.1 follows from results in Chen et al.They provide a one line proof stating `` Immediate application of Theorem 11 in Chen et al . ( 2017 ) '' but I do n't see how Theorem 11 directly applies to the specific problem setup the authors consider . Below , I elaborate the discrepancy I see with Chen et al.Algorithm 3 in Chen et al. , which the authors adapt , consider the following setup : there 's an objective L ( x , w ) which is possibly non-convex in `` x '' and is convex in `` w '' , and the goal is to minimize L over x and maximize it over w. They assume access to an oracle that can minimize L ( . , w ) over `` x '' for a fixed `` w '' , and provide an algorithm which performs gradient ascent updates on `` w '' and performs full optimization over `` x '' using the oracle . They show convergence guarantees for this algorithm . The min-max problem considered in the present paper also has two sets of parameters `` alpha '' and classifiers `` h '' . The objective is non-convex in alpha ( see eq.6 ) , and convex w.r.t . `` h '' ( Sec 3.1 ) . So the natural analogue of the algorithm of Chen et al.for this setup , would be to perform full optimization over alpha ( which the authors do ) , and to perform ( projected ) gradient updates on `` h '' . However , instead what the authors use for `` h '' is some form of a multiplicative weights update , which I find confusing . What you have is a multiplicative update again on alpha , and an invocation of another algorithm by Martinez et al.to learn a pareto-efficient classifier . Was the idea to perform a multiplicative update on `` h '' and project it back to the space of pareto-efficient classifiers ? I agree that like gradient ascent , multiplicative weights ( MW ) also enjoys no-regret guarantees but to apply MW , wo n't you need to maintain an explicit weight for each classifier `` h '' ? Instead , why is the MW update applied again to the alpha 's ?

Why would it make sense in any application to consider based on outcomes . In comparison to Duchi et . al 2020 , and Hashimoto et a . 2018 , the authors say that `` can be sub-optimal on the population segment that lies below their high-risk threshold ( doing unnecessary harm ) '' , however one can imagine that in some applications these high risk samples are in fact more important than the low risk ones .

In particular , if we only consider groups that introduce covariate shift ( i.e. , p ( X|A ) varies across different values of the group membership A ) but do not change the conditional target distribution ( p ( Y|X , A ) = p ( Y|X ) for all A ) , then the set of Pareto classifiers only contain one element and the Pareto curve degenerates to the utopia point . By specifically taking outcomes into account in our partition function , we allow for robustness to perturbations also on the conditional distribution p ( Y|X , A ) . This has now been clarified at the end of the 2nd paragraph of Section 2 . * Regarding comparison with Duchi et al.2020 and Hashimoto el al . 2018.The Pareto constraint on our classifier can be interpreted in another way . Namely , for any classifier that satisfies a desired performance objective over the high loss samples ( the main objective of Minimax Fairness ) , Pareto optimality allows us to select the classifier that simultaneously has the best performance on low-loss samples . There are only benefits to be had by restricting the search space to Pareto optimal solutions . This can be seen in Figure 3 , where BPF obtains the same results over the high-loss groups as DRO , but incurs lower losses over the low-loss samples on the same model . This has been further clarified in the captions of figure 3 , as well as other parts of the paper where the no-unnecessary-harm attribute of the Pareto framework is discussed , ( e.g. , in the discussion ) . Since both the Blind Pareto Fairness and DRO methods can be applied to essentially the same set of problems , unless there is no interest in providing a better level of service to the low-loss population , there is no reason to not using BPF over other non-pareto distributionally robust methods . All of these comments have been interleaved throughout the revised manuscript ."}], "0": {"review_id": "MMXhHXbNsa--0", "review_text": "# # Summary # # This paper considers the relevant problem of group fairness in ML when there are no predefined groups .

For which applications do the authors argue that distribution independent results are more useful , compared to these recent distributionally robust results ? # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Questions during rebuttal period : Please address and clarify the cons above # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Typos :", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We appreciate the constructive feedback from the reviewer ; we address their main concerns below and indicate how they have been implemented in the revised paper . * While we build on previous work on Pareto fairness , this paper has a number of major novelties which -in our view- are not incremental , including : - Considering unknown subgroups is a relatively new and important direction of research , not just in fairness but in robustness as well . - Some of our theoretical results are critical to shed further light onto this problem , e.g. , Lemma 3.2 indicates that there is a minimal size beyond which we can not control fairness/robustness and Lemma 3.3 explicitly bounds the price of blind fairness versus fairness with respect to known groups . * The main appeal of considering subgroups based on outcomes is the following For many risk-based measures of utility , such as crossentropy , Brier score , or \\ell_2 regression loss , the optimal classifier can be expressed as a function of the conditional output probability p ( Y|X ) , X being the input ( features ) and Y the output . In particular , if we only consider groups that introduce covariate shift ( i.e. , p ( X|A ) varies across different values of the group membership A ) but do not change the conditional target distribution ( p ( Y|X , A ) = p ( Y|X ) for all A ) , then the set of Pareto classifiers only contain one element and the Pareto curve degenerates to the utopia point . By specifically taking outcomes into account in our partition function , we allow for robustness to perturbations also on the conditional distribution p ( Y|X , A ) . This has now been clarified at the end of the 2nd paragraph of Section 2 . * Regarding comparison with Duchi et al.2020 and Hashimoto el al . 2018.The Pareto constraint on our classifier can be interpreted in another way . Namely , for any classifier that satisfies a desired performance objective over the high loss samples ( the main objective of Minimax Fairness ) , Pareto optimality allows us to select the classifier that simultaneously has the best performance on low-loss samples . There are only benefits to be had by restricting the search space to Pareto optimal solutions . This can be seen in Figure 3 , where BPF obtains the same results over the high-loss groups as DRO , but incurs lower losses over the low-loss samples on the same model . This has been further clarified in the captions of figure 3 , as well as other parts of the paper where the no-unnecessary-harm attribute of the Pareto framework is discussed , ( e.g. , in the discussion ) . Since both the Blind Pareto Fairness and DRO methods can be applied to essentially the same set of problems , unless there is no interest in providing a better level of service to the low-loss population , there is no reason to not using BPF over other non-pareto distributionally robust methods . All of these comments have been interleaved throughout the revised manuscript ."}}
