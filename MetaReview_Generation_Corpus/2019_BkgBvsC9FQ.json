In experiments, the proposed approach is compared to several state-of-the-art baselines on two dialog datasets, and improvements are shown both in terms of objective measures and human evaluation, making a strong support for the proposed approach.\nTwo reviewers suggest similarities with a recent ICML paper on ARAE and request including reference to it and also request examples demonstrating differences, which are included in the latest version of the paper.", "reviews": [{"review_id": "BkgBvsC9FQ-0", "review_text": "This paper uses Wasserstein GAN in conditional modeling of the dialog response generation. The main goal is to learn to use two network architecture to approximate the posterior distribution of the prior network. Instead of a KL divergence, like in VAE training, they use adversarial training and instead of using softmax output from the discriminator, they use Wasserstein distance. They also introduce a multi-modal distribution, GMM, while sampling from a the posterior during training, prior during the test time. The multi-modal sampling is based on gumbel-softmax over K possible G-distributions. They experiment on Daily Dialog and Switchborad datasets and show promising improvements on qualitative measures like BLEU and BOW embedding similarities, as well as qualitative measures including human evaluations comparing againsts substantial amount of baselines. The paper presents a marriage of a few ideas together. First of, it uses the conditional structure presented in the ACL 2017 paper \"Learning Discourse-level Diversity for Neural Dialog Models using Conditional Variational Autoencoders\". It's great that they used that paper as their baseline. The extension is to use a GAN objective function (the discriminator) as critic and use Wasserstein GAN to to resolve the gradient vanishing issue and produce smooth gradients everywhere. In ACL 2017 paper they use KL divergence to make the posterior from the prior and rec-networks as close to each other so at test time the prior network can generate the samples similar to the true data features distribution. In this paper instead of KL, they use a Discriminator as in 'Adversarial AutoEncoders' paper. This paper extends AAE, instead uses the Wasserstein distance instead (1-Lipschitz function instead of softmax for the discriminator). The W-GAN has been shown to produce good results in text generation in this year's ICML 2018 with the paper 'Adversarially Regularized GAN' (AARE). The idea was to resolve VAE posterior collapse issue by using a discriminator as a regularizer instead of KL divergence with a stronger sampler from the output of the generator to map from noise sampler into the latent space. Interestingly, AARE paper is not cited in this work, which i think is an issue. I understand that paper was just for generation purpose not specific to the dialog modeling, but it makes the claims in the paper misleading such as: \"Unlike VAE conversation models that impose a simple distribution over latent variables, DialogWAE models the data distribution by training a GAN within the latent variable space\". The part that i liked is the fact that they used multimodal gaussian distributions. I agree with the authors that using Gaussian for the approximating distribution only limits the sampling space and can weaken the models capability of variation. Although it is not proven for text, in image, the gaussian posteriors during training converge together into a single gaussian, causing blurry images. In this text this might correspond to dull responses in dialog. I would like the authors to comment on the interpretability of the components. Perhaps show a sample from each component (in the end the model decides which modal to choose before generation. Are these GMMs overlapping and how much ?
