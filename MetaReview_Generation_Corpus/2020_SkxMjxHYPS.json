Testing is conducting from the viewpoint of balancing accuracy with various resource metrics such as number of parameters, memory footprint, etc.\n\nIn the end, reviewer scores were partitioned as two accepts and two rejects.  However, the actual comments indicate that both nominal accept reviewers expressed borderline opinions regarding this work (e.g., one preferred a score of 4 or 5 if available, while the other explicitly stated that the paper was borderline acceptance-worthy).  Consequently in aggregate there was no strong support for acceptance and non-dismissable sentiment towards rejection.\n\nFor example, consistent with reviewer comments, a primary concern with this paper is that the novelty and technical contribution is rather limited, and hence, to warrant acceptance the empirical component should be especially compelling.  However, all the experiments are limited to cifar10/cifar100 data, with the exception of a couple extra tests on tiny ImageNet added after the rebuttal.  But these latter experiments are not so convincing since the base architecture has the best accuracy on VGG, and only on a single MobileNet test do we actually see clear-cut improvement.  Moreover, these new results appear to be based on just a single trial per data set (this important detail is unclear), and judging from Figure 2 of the revision, MobileNet results on cifar data can have very high variance blurring the distinction between methods.  It is therefore hard to draw firm conclusions at this point, and these two additional tiny ImageNet tests notwithstanding, we don't really know how to differentiate phenomena that are intrinsic to cifar data from other potentially relevant factors.\n\nOverall then, my view is that far more testing with different data types is warranted to strengthen the conclusions of this paper and compensate for the modest technical contribution.  Note also that training with all of these different filter templates is likely no less computationally expensive than some state-of-the-art pruning or related compression methods, and therefore it would be worth comparing head-to-head with such approaches.  This is especially true given that in many scenarios, test-time computational resources are more critical than marginal differences in training time, etc.", "reviews": [{"review_id": "SkxMjxHYPS-0", "review_text": "This paper changes the distribution of number of filters (called \u201cfilter distribution template\u201d, or \"template\") at each layer in modern deep Conv models (e.g., VGG, Inception, ResNet) and discover that the model with unconventional (e.g., reverse base, quadratic) template sometimes outperform conventional one (when f_{l+1} = 2 f_l). One big issue of this paper is that it didn't mention any theoretical reason why the total number of filters is the decisive factor for the test performance. It is not justified at all and the empirical result is also mixed (See Table 1). This brings about the question mark of the motivation of this paper from the first place. In contrast, empirically people have observed that a model with more parameters (and/or more FLOPs) within the same architecture family gives better performance. This is not directly related to the total number of filters, which the main topic in the paper. As a result, it is not clear whether a gain of the performance is simply due to the change of #parameters/FLOPs or due to the fact that different distribution templates are used. As shown in Table. 2, there is huge variation in terms of #parameters and FLOPs between different versions of the same network, making the comparison fairly difficult and inconclusive. I would strongly suggest the authors to compare the performance between different templates when keeping #parameters and/or FLOPs fixed. This should be easy to do by computing how many filters are needed per layer to reach the desired #parameters/FLOPs, while keeping the desired distribution. Also, to make a strong conclusion, they paper should also report ImageNet results trained with different templates.

However, after rereading the paper, the conclusion is still not that clear and I didn't see a clear take home message about which filter template is better than the other. In the section \"Template Effects with similar resources\", it seems that uniform template patterns is the best for many models, which somehow is negative results given the motivation of this paper. In addition, when comparing Fig. 3 in the original version versus that (Fig. 3) in the revision, some curves have changed their shape drastically (e.g., MobileNet on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100) and uniform template shows stronger dominance.

The authors propose applying a few simple heuristics in the form of \"templates\" for the number of convolutional filters across the different layers within an architecture. Apart from reversing the filter distribution, which starts a network with a large amount of filters and then reduces them (given how the filter number is generally increased with depth and reduction in spatial resolution), the authors also propose using the same number of filters per layer (\"uniform\"), as well as \"quadratic\" and \"negative quadratic\" distributions.

The accuracy vs. parameter count results are interesting, as the default architecture does worse a good amount of the time.

There are five different kind of distributions studied: constant number of filters, monotonically increasing and decreasing number of filters and convex/concave with a local extremum at the layer in the middle. For these distributions, the total number of filters is varied to study the trade-off between running-time vs. accuracy, memory vs. accuracy and parameter count vs. accuracy. Although the paper is purely experimental without any particular theoretical considerations, it presents a few surprising observations defying conventional wisdom: - The standard method of increasing the number of filters as the number of convolutional nodes is increasing is not the most optimal strategy in most cases. - The optimal distribution of channels is highly dependent on the network architecture. - Some network architectures are highly stable with respect to the distribution of channels, while others are very sensitive.

This is not clarified in this paper. - The grammar of the paper is poor, even the abstract is hard to read and interpret. - The paper presents itself as a methodology for automatically generating the optimal number of channels, while it is more of a one-off experiment and observation than a general purpose method.
