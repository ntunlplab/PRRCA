The paper finds that advantages and the sampling ratio have the heaviest tails . Based on this insight , the authors propose a robust version of the PPO gradient estimator that avoids clipping and heuristics , but which still generally matches performance with PPO . * * Assessment : * * The paper tests a simple , important , and previously un-studied hypothesis , and provides a convincing empirical analysis . It provides a potential step towards designing better RL algorithms without the heuristics and sensitivity of current RL algorithms , and as such , would be of great interest to the reinforcement learning community at ICLR . Nevertheless , there are some major concerns detailed below , primarily relating to the validity of the PPO-NoClip objective . Conditional on these concerns being addressed , I would recommend acceptance . * * Major Comments : * * While the likelihood clipping term in PPO is certainly heuristic , it serves a purpose that is not properly discussed in the paper : to prevent $ \\pi_\\theta $ from deviating from $ \\pi_0 $ . More precisely , when function approximation is used for the policy , the surrogate objective $ E_ { s \\sim \\pi_0 , a\\sim \\pi_\\theta } [ A_ { \\pi_0 } ( s , a ) ] $ is not necessarily a good surrogate when $ \\pi_\\theta $ is far from $ \\pi_0 $ * * even with infinite samples * * . This is not an issue with finite sampling as is mentioned in the preliminaries , and remains a problem even with access to the true expectation ( that is , even when heavy-tailed behavior is not a problem ) . See the TRPO paper [ 1 ] for more discussion . This point needs to be made more explicit in the main paper . As a result , it is my understanding PPO-NoClip is simply not an appropriate gradient / objective to be analyzing when $ \\pi_\\theta $ is very far from $ \\pi_0 $ . This is a problem for the off-policy analysis , since the PPO-NoClip objective and its gradient do not relate to the original expected return objective , and so may not be meaningful quantities to measure or analyze . My initial assessment is that this highly reduces the value of the off-policy experiments for me . * * Clarity * * : The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow .

If only on-policy iterations are conducted , are n't the PPO and A2C updates the same ( both equivalent to standard policy gradients ) . - I found the x labels for Figure 1 and Figure 2 confusing . From what I understood , Figure 1 is taken across iterations ( different data collection policies for each step ) but Figure 2 is taken within a single iteration ? This could be more clear . - I found the obervation that the negative advantages are the ones with heavy tails to be interesting .

To justify the use of PPO-NoClip in our analysis experiments , we show that with optimal hyperparameters used in experiments , agents trained with PPO-NoClip maintains a KL based trust-region like PPO throughout the training .

We performed two experiments : ( i ) First , we study the effects of heavy-tailedness in negative advantages . By clipping the outlier negative advantages ( with an environment dependent threshold ) in the PPO loss , we show that the induced heavy-tailedness in advantages gets reduced and the performance of the agent improves . Since the advantage estimates significantly contribute to the observed heavy-tailed behavior , we show that clipping outlier advantages stabilizes the training and improves agents ' performance on 5 out of 8 MuJoCo tasks . While this may not be practical ( due to per environment thresholds ) , the primary purpose of this study is to illustrate that heavy-tailedness in advantages actually hurt the optimization process , and clipping advantages lead to improvements in the agents ' performance ( Section J.1 ) . ( ii ) Second , we seek to understand the effects of heavy-tailedness induced due to heavy-tailedness in the likelihood ratios induced during off-policy training . We vary the number of off-policy gradient steps taken by an agent trained with PPO-NoClip and show that the additional off-policy learning exacerbates heavy-tailedness in ratios and directly affects the agent performance even while maintaining trust-region with mean KL metric . The findings from this experiment clearly highlight the issues due to induced heavy-tailedness in likelihood hindering efficient policy optimization ( Section J.2 ) . * * \u201c Some recent work [ 2 ] also studies a similar phenomenon more generally in stochastic PG methods ... would be worth citing \u201d * * Thanks for pointing this out .

The question of heavy-tailedness is well-motivated and important . There has been growing interest in characterizing the tails of gradient norms , especially in light of assumptions in optimization theory that may be invalidated by heavy tails ( e.g. , second moment bound ) . Characterization of the heavy tail property permits further understanding of why our algorithms might fail , and how we might improve them . The central claims are well-substantiated with experiments ( subject to statistical significance concerns below ) . Sections 3.1-3.2 show that heavy-tailed gradient norms occur both in the on-policy and off-policy parts of PPO . I especially liked the care in determining the source of the heavy-tailedness : the advantage in the on-policy case and the IS ratio in the off-policy case . Section 3.3 shows that the clipping of the PPO objective reduces the heavy-tailedness of the gradients , which is further support for the relevance of heavy-tailedness . I appreciated the promising connection made to the field of robust statistics . In section 4 , the paper modifies a robust gradient estimation technique to apply in PPO . The fact that Robust-PPO-NoClip does either as well ( again , subject to statistical significance concerns below ) as or better than PPO or its NoClip variant is evidence that not accounting for heavy-tailed gradients can impede performance . * * Negatives * * The main problem with this work is the relative lack of statistical significance analysis ( figs 1-4 ) . I would have liked to see error bars on figs 1-4 . For the individual learning curves ( fig 11 ) in the appendix , it seems that more runs are necessary given the noisiness of the curves . Are there more disaggregated plots of the kurtoses over the environments ( in addition to the three in the appendix ) ? I 'm not totally sure what to make of averaging over environments whose dynamics could be quite different . For each environment , it also seems that only 10 seeds were run . Given that prior work ( Henderson et al. , 2017 ) suggests that RL algorithms are extremely sensitive to the random seed , I would have liked to see more seeds ( minimum 20 , preferably 30+ ) . The work needs some further discussion on why Robust-PPO-NoClip only seemed to beat PPO-NoClip in some environments , but not others . * * Summary * * I 'm leaning towards a marginal accept for the paper : I do think the contribution of the paper is valuable , despite the concerns I have outlined above about statistical significance . I think these concerns are strongest for the control experiments ( a relatively smaller part of the paper ) given that they are per-environment and utilize fewer samples to estimate the return , as opposed to the gradient estimation experiments for which a batch size of 64 was used for the gradient norm estimation . I think this paper otherwise provides much value in characterizing an important property of PPO , opening the way for future RL algorithms that can better deal with heavy-tailedness . * * Things which did n't affect my decision * * 1 .

They find that PPO gradients are heavy-tailed , which means that they are sensitive to outliers , which means computing the expected gradient is hard . The paper studies two causes of this issue -- advantage estimation errors and the harm caused by optimizing density ratios in a sampled setting , and shows that removing either of them with the other issue controlled for helps PPO . They then propose to use a standard robust mean estimation technique to obtain a robust gradient mean estimator that is plugged into PPO , and performs sort of somewhat worse than vanilla PPO . I like the paper , but I do think the paper misses some comparison to prior work and alternate views of looking at the same phenomenon which I will discuss next . I am not sure if heavy-tailedess of gradients is the best way of looking at it . Very similar phenomena have been studied in the form of using regularization to prevent overfitting to the density ratios in off-policy bandits ( see Swaminathan et al.2015 ) , and also the impact of variance reduction techniques such as the use of baselines in policy optimization ( several papers ) . What these papers show is that ( 1 ) optimizing against importance weighting in the presence of samples may not lead to an improvement in the overall objective , which is bad -- and some on-policy regularization is employed ( 2 ) baselines help because they make it possible to reduce variance , however , their form also impacts learning dynamics and exploration ( see Chung et al. , Beyond variance reduction : Understanding the true impact of baselines on policy optimization ) and just looking at variance may not be enough to talk about the efficacy of a baseline . So baselines affect optimization issues even in an expected sense , and just variance is not the best way of looking at the efficacy of a baseline . Translated to PPO , this means that some advantage estimators that lead to higher variance gradients or heavy-tailed gradients might actually be better because the learning dynamics and exploration is better here . Therefore , these are alternate ways of explaining the same issue that the paper points out . So , why is heavy-tailedness interesting , and why should we not look at these other interpretations ? In particular , is heavy-tailedness always bad ? I suspect not -- in some cases , I might want to have more heavy-tailed gradients just because they can either help to navigate the optimization landscape ( see Mei et al.On the Global Convergence of Softmax Policy Gradient Methods , or Schaul et al.Ray Interference : a Source of Plateaus in Deep Reinforcement Learning or Chen et al.Surrogate Objectives for Batch Policy Optimization in One-step Decision Making , for a discussion of how the true expected policy gradient can have many saddle points and can have slow convergence based on initialization ) by avoiding getting stuck at saddle points . So maybe it is not always that bad ? Perhaps some analysis in settings where optimization challenges exist and a comparison of the impact of heavy-tailedness in scenarios where optimization challenges do n't exist is a possible way to answer this question . Also what happens if I compute the true advantages ? Heavy tailedness based on your presented analysis would decrease but would it be better to still do robust gradient estimation ? I suspect there will still be some sort of overfitting due to finite sample reuse in the off-policy updates in PPO , but it is interesting to see how much the performance improves in that case . And what would happen in methods that actually derive policy updates from a closed-form objective such as REPS , RWR/AWR , SIL , MPO , etc ? Finally , the method seems like fixing an effect and not the cause -- if the end goal is to obtain better advantage estimates and do better optimization with density ratios , why not fix that directly , rather than using robust mean estimation , which seems like a complex procedure ? One way of fixing advantages , for instance , is to just utilize a monotonic function of advantages such as the indicator function in Self-imitation learning and exponentiation function in AWR . Or for instance , centering the advantages which PPO uses can also help ( see https : //openreview.net/pdf ? id=SJaP_-xAb ) and maybe even using self-normalization on the importance weights which are optimized in PPO . How would these solutions compare to the proposed estimator ? I think that the paper will benefit from a more concrete discussion of these aspects , especially contrasting and clearly stating the benefits of the proposed view of understanding PPO in comparison with prior explanations and by doing a more extensive evaluation of simpler alternatives to fixing this issue .", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We thank the reviewer for the thoughtful and detailed review . * * '' ... but I do think the paper misses some comparison to alternate views ... I am not sure if heavy-tailedess is the best way of looking at it . `` * * Thanks for pointing out relevant references . We are working to add a discussion of these papers in our related work section . We do not assert categorically that heavy-tailedness of gradients is the only useful for understanding \\ * \\ * all\\ * \\ * optimization issues in importance weighted policy gradients . However , we do think that this a promising perspective on the problem , as demonstrated by our analysis here unearthing some previously unknown issues and providing a more principled framework for analyzing and fixing these issues . Our analysis provides a novel perspective to PPO heuristics that are poorly understood ( Ilyas et al. , 2018 , Engstrom et al. , 2019 ) . Inspired by Engstrom et al. , we show that PPO-NoClip also maintains a KL based trust-region when trained with tuned hyperparameters ( App I ) . We argue that in practice , PPO clipping heuristics are tackling issues beyond just maintaining a trust-region . Moreover , we demonstrate that even while PPO doesn \u2019 t maintain a ratio based trust-region despite being directly trained with ratio-clipping objective ( Engstrom et al . ) , the clipping trick serves to alleviate heavy-tailedness which significantly improves the performance of the agent . To summarize , we are not claiming that our perspective provides a full account of the dynamics of PPO ( and indeed other interpretations can provide useful explanations to some problems ) . We just believe that this framework provides a novel perspective to instability issues in deep RL , enjoys some experimental support for the usefulness of the perspective , and can potentially open the door to more principled algorithmic developments in deep RL . * * '' Is heavy-tailedness always bad ? '' and comparison with Chung et . al . * * Thanks for pointing this out . It \u2019 s interesting to note that larger higher moments with fixed variance can lead to improved exploration in simple MDPs . This is also related to one view of heavy-tailedness in supervised learning where authors conjectured that heavy-tailedness in gradients can improve generalization ( Simsekli et.al.2019 ) .However , there is another view to heavy-tailedness where outliers cause instability in the learning process in deep models ( Zhang et.al.2019a ; b ) .We conjecture that in deep RL where the optimization process is known to be brittle ( Henderson et.al.2017 ; 2018 ) , heavy-tailedness can exacerbate instability and this is a more prominent effect than any help it might offer in efficient exploration . Indeed with ablation experiments ( added in App J ) , we show that increasing heavy-tailedness in likelihood ratios hurt the agent \u2019 s performance , and mitigating heavy-tailedness in advantage estimates improves learning dynamics and hence the agent \u2019 s performance . * * '' What happens if I compute the true advantages ? Heavy tailedness would decrease but better to still do robust estimation ? `` * * Our analysis shows two primary contributing factors to the heavy-tailed behavior : One , due to induced heavy-tailedness in likelihood-ratios and the other in advantages estimates . We added a new section ( App J ) where we demonstrate how heavy-tailedness in ratios and advantage estimates individually contribute to the optimization issues in PPO . While fixing the heavy-tailedness in advantages will remove one source , the heavy-tailedness induced during off-policy training would still be an issue . Moreover , as shown in Sec 3.3 , PPO clipping heuristics primarily serve to offset the heavy-tailedness induced during off-policy gradient stepshighlighting the need to tackle heavy-tailedness in ratios . Note that PPO-NoClip that doesn \u2019 t handle the ratios induced heavy-tailedness and performs much worse than PPO . We also have a clarification question regarding the suggested experiment . We are not sure about how to compute true advantages in MuJoCo environments with PPO and we request if the reviewer can further clarify this . * * '' Finally , the method seems like fixing an effect and not the cause \u2026 '' * * Yes , we agree that we fix the effect and don \u2019 t alter the underlying cause . But the main contribution of our work is not developing RL algorithms that improve performance over PPO , but rather to understand the nature of gradients ( and contributions of various loss components in that behavior ) in importance-weighted policy gradients . The main takeaway from our robust estimation is to highlight that even without PPO clipping heuristics , we can achieve close to PPO performance with a method that is principally designed to fix the heavy-tailedness issue . We believe that this strengthens our conjecture of heavy-tailedness being an issue with optimization .

To justify the use of PPO-NoClip in our analysis experiments , we show that with optimal hyperparameters used in experiments , agents trained with PPO-NoClip maintains a KL based trust-region like PPO throughout the training .

We performed two experiments : ( i ) First , we study the effects of heavy-tailedness in negative advantages . By clipping the outlier negative advantages ( with an environment dependent threshold ) in the PPO loss , we show that the induced heavy-tailedness in advantages gets reduced and the performance of the agent improves . Since the advantage estimates significantly contribute to the observed heavy-tailed behavior , we show that clipping outlier advantages stabilizes the training and improves agents ' performance on 5 out of 8 MuJoCo tasks . While this may not be practical ( due to per environment thresholds ) , the primary purpose of this study is to illustrate that heavy-tailedness in advantages actually hurt the optimization process , and clipping advantages lead to improvements in the agents ' performance ( Section J.1 ) . ( ii ) Second , we seek to understand the effects of heavy-tailedness induced due to heavy-tailedness in the likelihood ratios induced during off-policy training . We vary the number of off-policy gradient steps taken by an agent trained with PPO-NoClip and show that the additional off-policy learning exacerbates heavy-tailedness in ratios and directly affects the agent performance even while maintaining trust-region with mean KL metric . The findings from this experiment clearly highlight the issues due to induced heavy-tailedness in likelihood hindering efficient policy optimization ( Section J.2 ) . * * \u201c Some recent work [ 2 ] also studies a similar phenomenon more generally in stochastic PG methods ... would be worth citing \u201d * * Thanks for pointing this out .

The question of heavy-tailedness is well-motivated and important . There has been growing interest in characterizing the tails of gradient norms , especially in light of assumptions in optimization theory that may be invalidated by heavy tails ( e.g. , second moment bound ) . Characterization of the heavy tail property permits further understanding of why our algorithms might fail , and how we might improve them . The central claims are well-substantiated with experiments ( subject to statistical significance concerns below ) . Sections 3.1-3.2 show that heavy-tailed gradient norms occur both in the on-policy and off-policy parts of PPO . I especially liked the care in determining the source of the heavy-tailedness : the advantage in the on-policy case and the IS ratio in the off-policy case . Section 3.3 shows that the clipping of the PPO objective reduces the heavy-tailedness of the gradients , which is further support for the relevance of heavy-tailedness . I appreciated the promising connection made to the field of robust statistics . In section 4 , the paper modifies a robust gradient estimation technique to apply in PPO . The fact that Robust-PPO-NoClip does either as well ( again , subject to statistical significance concerns below ) as or better than PPO or its NoClip variant is evidence that not accounting for heavy-tailed gradients can impede performance . * * Negatives * * The main problem with this work is the relative lack of statistical significance analysis ( figs 1-4 ) .

I think these concerns are strongest for the control experiments ( a relatively smaller part of the paper ) given that they are per-environment and utilize fewer samples to estimate the return , as opposed to the gradient estimation experiments for which a batch size of 64 was used for the gradient norm estimation .

They find that PPO gradients are heavy-tailed , which means that they are sensitive to outliers , which means computing the expected gradient is hard . The paper studies two causes of this issue -- advantage estimation errors and the harm caused by optimizing density ratios in a sampled setting , and shows that removing either of them with the other issue controlled for helps PPO . They then propose to use a standard robust mean estimation technique to obtain a robust gradient mean estimator that is plugged into PPO , and performs sort of somewhat worse than vanilla PPO . I like the paper , but I do think the paper misses some comparison to prior work and alternate views of looking at the same phenomenon which I will discuss next . I am not sure if heavy-tailedess of gradients is the best way of looking at it . Very similar phenomena have been studied in the form of using regularization to prevent overfitting to the density ratios in off-policy bandits ( see Swaminathan et al.2015 ) , and also the impact of variance reduction techniques such as the use of baselines in policy optimization ( several papers ) . What these papers show is that ( 1 ) optimizing against importance weighting in the presence of samples may not lead to an improvement in the overall objective , which is bad -- and some on-policy regularization is employed ( 2 ) baselines help because they make it possible to reduce variance , however , their form also impacts learning dynamics and exploration ( see Chung et al. , Beyond variance reduction : Understanding the true impact of baselines on policy optimization ) and just looking at variance may not be enough to talk about the efficacy of a baseline . So baselines affect optimization issues even in an expected sense , and just variance is not the best way of looking at the efficacy of a baseline . Translated to PPO , this means that some advantage estimators that lead to higher variance gradients or heavy-tailed gradients might actually be better because the learning dynamics and exploration is better here . Therefore , these are alternate ways of explaining the same issue that the paper points out . So , why is heavy-tailedness interesting , and why should we not look at these other interpretations ? In particular , is heavy-tailedness always bad ? I suspect not -- in some cases , I might want to have more heavy-tailed gradients just because they can either help to navigate the optimization landscape ( see Mei et al.On the Global Convergence of Softmax Policy Gradient Methods , or Schaul et al.Ray Interference : a Source of Plateaus in Deep Reinforcement Learning or Chen et al.Surrogate Objectives for Batch Policy Optimization in One-step Decision Making , for a discussion of how the true expected policy gradient can have many saddle points and can have slow convergence based on initialization ) by avoiding getting stuck at saddle points . So maybe it is not always that bad ? Perhaps some analysis in settings where optimization challenges exist and a comparison of the impact of heavy-tailedness in scenarios where optimization challenges do n't exist is a possible way to answer this question . Also what happens if I compute the true advantages ? Heavy tailedness based on your presented analysis would decrease but would it be better to still do robust gradient estimation ? I suspect there will still be some sort of overfitting due to finite sample reuse in the off-policy updates in PPO , but it is interesting to see how much the performance improves in that case . And what would happen in methods that actually derive policy updates from a closed-form objective such as REPS , RWR/AWR , SIL , MPO , etc ? Finally , the method seems like fixing an effect and not the cause -- if the end goal is to obtain better advantage estimates and do better optimization with density ratios , why not fix that directly , rather than using robust mean estimation , which seems like a complex procedure ? One way of fixing advantages , for instance , is to just utilize a monotonic function of advantages such as the indicator function in Self-imitation learning and exponentiation function in AWR . Or for instance , centering the advantages which PPO uses can also help ( see https : //openreview.net/pdf ? id=SJaP_-xAb ) and maybe even using self-normalization on the importance weights which are optimized in PPO . How would these solutions compare to the proposed estimator ? I think that the paper will benefit from a more concrete discussion of these aspects , especially contrasting and clearly stating the benefits of the proposed view of understanding PPO in comparison with prior explanations and by doing a more extensive evaluation of simpler alternatives to fixing this issue .", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We thank the reviewer for the thoughtful and detailed review . * * '' ... but I do think the paper misses some comparison to alternate views ... I am not sure if heavy-tailedess is the best way of looking at it . `` * * Thanks for pointing out relevant references . We are working to add a discussion of these papers in our related work section . We do not assert categorically that heavy-tailedness of gradients is the only useful for understanding \\ * \\ * all\\ * \\ * optimization issues in importance weighted policy gradients . However , we do think that this a promising perspective on the problem , as demonstrated by our analysis here unearthing some previously unknown issues and providing a more principled framework for analyzing and fixing these issues . Our analysis provides a novel perspective to PPO heuristics that are poorly understood ( Ilyas et al. , 2018 , Engstrom et al. , 2019 ) . Inspired by Engstrom et al. , we show that PPO-NoClip also maintains a KL based trust-region when trained with tuned hyperparameters ( App I ) . We argue that in practice , PPO clipping heuristics are tackling issues beyond just maintaining a trust-region . Moreover , we demonstrate that even while PPO doesn \u2019 t maintain a ratio based trust-region despite being directly trained with ratio-clipping objective ( Engstrom et al . ) , the clipping trick serves to alleviate heavy-tailedness which significantly improves the performance of the agent . To summarize , we are not claiming that our perspective provides a full account of the dynamics of PPO ( and indeed other interpretations can provide useful explanations to some problems ) . We just believe that this framework provides a novel perspective to instability issues in deep RL , enjoys some experimental support for the usefulness of the perspective , and can potentially open the door to more principled algorithmic developments in deep RL . * * '' Is heavy-tailedness always bad ? '' and comparison with Chung et . al . * * Thanks for pointing this out . It \u2019 s interesting to note that larger higher moments with fixed variance can lead to improved exploration in simple MDPs . This is also related to one view of heavy-tailedness in supervised learning where authors conjectured that heavy-tailedness in gradients can improve generalization ( Simsekli et.al.2019 ) .However , there is another view to heavy-tailedness where outliers cause instability in the learning process in deep models ( Zhang et.al.2019a ; b ) .We conjecture that in deep RL where the optimization process is known to be brittle ( Henderson et.al.2017 ; 2018 ) , heavy-tailedness can exacerbate instability and this is a more prominent effect than any help it might offer in efficient exploration . Indeed with ablation experiments ( added in App J ) , we show that increasing heavy-tailedness in likelihood ratios hurt the agent \u2019 s performance , and mitigating heavy-tailedness in advantage estimates improves learning dynamics and hence the agent \u2019 s performance . * * '' What happens if I compute the true advantages ? Heavy tailedness would decrease but better to still do robust estimation ? `` * * Our analysis shows two primary contributing factors to the heavy-tailed behavior : One , due to induced heavy-tailedness in likelihood-ratios and the other in advantages estimates . We added a new section ( App J ) where we demonstrate how heavy-tailedness in ratios and advantage estimates individually contribute to the optimization issues in PPO . While fixing the heavy-tailedness in advantages will remove one source , the heavy-tailedness induced during off-policy training would still be an issue . Moreover , as shown in Sec 3.3 , PPO clipping heuristics primarily serve to offset the heavy-tailedness induced during off-policy gradient stepshighlighting the need to tackle heavy-tailedness in ratios . Note that PPO-NoClip that doesn \u2019 t handle the ratios induced heavy-tailedness and performs much worse than PPO . We also have a clarification question regarding the suggested experiment . We are not sure about how to compute true advantages in MuJoCo environments with PPO and we request if the reviewer can further clarify this . * * '' Finally , the method seems like fixing an effect and not the cause \u2026 '' * * Yes , we agree that we fix the effect and don \u2019 t alter the underlying cause . But the main contribution of our work is not developing RL algorithms that improve performance over PPO , but rather to understand the nature of gradients ( and contributions of various loss components in that behavior ) in importance-weighted policy gradients . The main takeaway from our robust estimation is to highlight that even without PPO clipping heuristics , we can achieve close to PPO performance with a method that is principally designed to fix the heavy-tailedness issue .
