{"year": "2021", "forum": "aLtty4sUo0o", "title": "Quickest change detection for multi-task problems under unknown parameters", "decision": "Reject", "meta_review": "The paper treats a relevant and challenging problem in sequential learning scenarios -- how to detect distributional change over time when the pre- and post-change distributions are not known up to certainty. All reviewers more or less acknowledge that the paper presents a new approach towards solving this inference problem, where the high level idea is to approximately learn the pre- and post-change distribution parameters online using gradient descent and then apply well-known tests for change detection (e.g., the Shiryaev or CUSUM rules) with these assumed to be the pre- and post-change parameters.\n\nHowever, beyond the concerns expressed by the reviewers, my finding after going through the manuscript myself is that the presentation of the paper's results leaves a lot to be desired in terms of clarity of exposition, comprehensiveness of performance benchmarking and comparison to existing approaches. Despite some of the reviwers' scores being revised upwards, the overall evaluation of the paper according to me is not adequate to merit acceptance, as per the concerns listed below. \n\n1. There are two settings assumed in the paper (beginning of Sec. 2): (a) a completely Bayesian one, with the pre- and post-change distributional parameters drawn from a prior \\cal{F} and the change time lambda drawn from a prior pi, and (b) a minmax one, where everything is the same as in (a) except that there is no prior over the change time lambda. However, it is not at all clear, in the algorithm design of the paper, where the prior \\cal{F} over the distributions is used in computing (or approximating) conditional probabilities such as P[lambda | v_alpha = n].\n\n2. There seem to be meaningless (or ill-defined) expressions in the paper's crucial portion motivating the algorithm design, such as P(X_t ~ f_{theta_0} | v_alpha = n), P(X_t ~ f_{theta_1} | v_alpha = n). It is hard to understand what the event \"X_t ~ f_{theta_0}\" even means -- I find it impossible to relate it to a sample path property. This leads me to question the validity of the technical development in the paper.\n\n3. Another undefined term is \"r-quickly\" in eq. (4); I had to dig through the classical work of Lai, and Tartakovsky-Veeravalli to get a formal definition for this term. This is not to be expected of a paper that attempts to develop a new change point detection procedure from scratch, especially to an audience (ICLR) that may largely be unfamiliar with classicalt change detection theory. \n\n4. There are several technical statements made without adequate formal proof, e.g., \"Given the optimal stopping time \\nu, it's possible to evaluate the posterior distribution of the change point P(lambda=t | v_alpha=n), which in turn is a good classifier of the pre and post change observation\". What the precise meaning of the term \"classifier\" is, what its \"goodness\" is, and how exactly it is related to the posterior distribution of lambda given the value of v_alpha, is formally not spelt out for a paper that largely uses formal probability language to develop its main results.\n\n5. While I understand that the final algorithm to detect the change involves several approximations and heuristics along the way, which may very well be intuitively appealing, I do not understand (even after repeated passes over the submission) several key aspects -- a concern also expressed by Reviewer 3. Why is it reasonable to assume that the conditional distribution of the change time lambda given the algorithm's stop time v_alpha would be logistic, and with the specific parameters mu and s given in the section \"Distribution Approximation\"? Moreover, it is hard to discern from the crucial Section 3.2 why the functions f_0^n, f_1^n should be useful in practice as proxies to the actual expected log likelihood ratios under the true parameters -- despite Lemma 2 showing that they converge to the true expectations (again, the sense in which this convergence occurs is omitted leading to imprecision in the statement), the rates as a function of n, t_2 may be slow. I agree in this regard with the same concern voiced by Reviewer 1, and do not see a satisfactory explanation to it in the paper's discussion.\n\n6. Comparison to literature. Contrary to the general picture painted in the paper about the lack of sufficient investigation of the \"unknown pre and post change parameter\" case, there does seem to be a rigorous body of work existing in this line that is not discussed in the manuscript. For instance, \"SEQUENTIAL CHANGE-POINT DETECTION WHEN THE PRE- AND POST-CHANGE PARAMETERS ARE UNKNOWN\", Lai and Xing, 2009, and \"A BAYESIAN APPROACH TO SEQUENTIAL SURVEILLANCE IN EXPONENTIAL FAMILIES\", Lai-Liu-Xing, 2009, are both works that address this very setting and in a comprehensive manner with theoretical guarantees. What the current manuscript does, in the context of both these works, is highly unclear. Is it trying to suggest an approximate way of computing the natural posterior distribution of the change time lambda given all data up to now, using the proxy P(lambda | v_alpha = n), or using a completely different approach altogether, is not adequately discussed at all, which makes the motivating arguments for the algorithm vague.\n\n7. Finally, but in no lesser measure, the Experimental Results section features a rather narrow set of (two) scenarios for which it presents numerics. For a paper that claims to demonstrate \"experimental results (over a wide variety of settings)\" [from the author response], this is quite telling as it renders the argument in favor of the paper's approach quite weak. Here again, for the first (synthetic) setting, I do not understand the relevance of the neural network adopted to fix the parameters of a Gaussian distribution. Moreover, the reported distributions of the \"regretted detection delay\" seem to be quite wide for all the approaches compared (unknown params, adaptive, GLR), precluding a reasonable comparison of their performance. The author(s) would do well to expand the scope of both synthetic and non-synthetic experiments to show the validity of their approach, and in each case carry out many more independent trials than just 500 for more accurate benchmarks.\n\nI do note that more experimental results have been reported in the appendix, but I would presume that they have more value being in the main body after the algorithm design is explained in a more succinct and clearer manner. This can only come about by a significant rewriting and reorganizing of the paper, which I am confident the author(s) can carry out in order to make this into a much stronger submission. I wish the author(s) good luck on this, and hope to see the strengths of this new approach brought out in a more impactful manner in the next revision.\n", "reviews": [{"review_id": "aLtty4sUo0o-0", "review_text": "* * * * * Paper 's Summary * * * * * This paper considers the quickest change detection ( QCD ) problem where pre-change and post-change distributions are unknown .

However , it seems to me that the proposed algorithm is very general for change detection problem . Except the one subsection in the experiments , I did n't see much connection to multi-task problems . * * We agree with the reviewer that our work is very general and can have a multitude of other possible applications . However , the QCD literature usually assume a nominal pre-change behaviour . Multi-task problems are a setting in which this assumption does not hold up . A crucial feature for multi-task RL is obviously the ability to detect change points in a tractable way . This is what brought us to this problem . Many other motivating examples are introduced in Appendix . However if you still find the title misleading , we propose to remove the 'multi-task ' part from the title . * * The theoretical results are not very strong . There is no Theorem one can claim for the performance of the proposed algorithm . As the algorithm is an approximation to some optimal approach , one may provide a result in the form of competitive ratio or convergence rate . However , Lemma 3 is only some asymptotic behavior of the loglikelihood . * * We agree that our results do not provide strong non-asymptotic convergence guarantees . However , our theoretical results ( Lemma 1-3 ) justify that our algorithm efficiently approximates $ L_t^ * $ . We believe that this in itself is an asymptotic performance guarantee : In fact , evaluating the performance of our algorithms can boil down to evaluating the detection delay of the Shiayev stopping time $ \\mathbb { E } [ | \\nu - \\nu_\\alpha^S | ] $ . In our setting , this quantity is arguably proportional to the estimation error $ \\mathbb { E } [ |S_n^ { \\theta^0_t , \\theta^1_t } - S_n^ { \\theta_0^ * , \\theta_1^ * } | ] $ . which in turn is proportional to $ \\mathbb { E } [ |L_t - L_t^ * | ] $ . However deriving explicitly this relationship is not only cumbersome ( integrating over all possible stopping time scenarios ) , but also require additional assumptions over the convergence rate of Equation 5 . For these reasons , we chose to defend our algorithm with theoretically grounded insights and experimental results ( over a wide variety of settings ) rather than additional assumptions over this speed of convergence . * * How should one choose the hyper-parameters like c and epsilon ? Are the results in section 5 tuned by grid search and presented the best one ? * * We provide in Appendix E-1 some insight over the best practice to use when selecting these parameters . In a nutshell they depend on how much variability is expected in your data after the change ( True KL divergence between pre- and post- change distributions ) and on the stationarity of your distributions ( Mixing time ) . The hyper-parameters in the presented results have been indeed tuned by grid-search ."}}
