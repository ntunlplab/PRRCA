The paper show good results of the proposed method for dataset alignment on several applications. However, the motivation of the dataset alignment seems quite weak (e.g. it is unclear the advantage for jointly analysis when one merge datasets by alignment). The side information is not clearly easy to obtain in practice, since it simply enforces the constraints on the transportation polytope (i.e. how one knows that which subset of a given class C_A on dataset A is matched with a certain subset of another class C_B on dataset B, it seems easy to obtain the side information about matching over the whole class C_A with C_B, and it seems nontrivial to obtain the subset matching).

Overall, I lean on the negative side. Below are some of my concerns: 1) As stated above, I am curious how one can obtain the side information about the subset matching? For example, in Figure 1, it seems trivial to have a side information about the whole class matching and quite nontrivial to obtain a matching for subsets of any given class. 2) The side information enforces the constraints on the feasible set of the transportation polytope. It seems to me that one can solve the variant of optimal transport (or Sinkhorn) with those extra constraints directly, it is unclear to me how this kind of side information can navigate the transport cost learning. Moreover, given a new pairs of input, the proposed method needs to optimize the transport cost again which make the benefits to learn to transport cost quite limited. Overall, a trivial baseline for the proposed method is to solve directly optimal transport with those extra constrains (from side information) directly (maybe with the Euclidean cost metric), but not the optimal transport without extra constraints as in the current setting. 3) The authors may need to consider to reorganize the presentation.

The main idea is to use a neural network to define a transport cost between two examples instead of using the popular Euclidean distance and have a L2 regularizer that encourages the resulting transport plan to be small if two examples belong to the same subset. The results on synthetic datasets (2D, MNIST image) and real-world datasets (RNA sequence) show that the learned transport cost outperforms the Euclidean distance and Procrustes-based OT. # Originality - This paper considers a new problem which is to learn OT given \"subset correspondence\" information. The prior work does not have a mechanism to utilize such information or requires more side information such as pair-wise matching. # Quality - The idea of parameterizing the transport cost using a neural network is novel to my knowledge. The idea of regularizing the transport cost based on the subset correspondence information sounds sensible. - The empirical result is quite comprehensive and convincing in that it includes from illustrative examples to real-world datasets (RNAs) and includes many relevant baselines. # Clarity - The paper is well-organized and well-written. - Since this paper considers a new problem (learning OT with subset correspondence data), it would be great to motivate and explain the problem better in the introduction.

The algorithm is based on the Sinkhorn-Knopp iterative procedure for approximating the optimal transport plan. The current paper proves that the Sinkhorn transport plan with a parameterized cost function is infinitely differentiable. The cost function can thus be optimized by unrolling the Sinkhorn iteration for a fixed number of steps and then backpropagating through the iterative updates. The cost function is optimized via a loss function derived from side information, specifically subsets of the two datasets to be aligned that contain elements that should be matched in the optimal transport plan. Experiments on a variety of synthetic and real datasets show that the proposed method is often better than, and almost always competitive with, other modern approaches. I recommend that the paper be accepted. The paper presents a well-justified and seemingly novel approach to solving an important problem, and demonstrates empirically that it compares favorably to other approaches. The proposed technique seems to be a fairly small extension to existing work, but together with its analysis and experiments it is sufficiently novel.
