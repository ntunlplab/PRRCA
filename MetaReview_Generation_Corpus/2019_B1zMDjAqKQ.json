The proposed model is based on an autoencoder structure with a recurrent self-organizing network for multisensory binding of latent representations. The authors perform experiments to show the reconstruction of image and audio signals given the other, as well as discriminative results on audio and image classification. Strengths: 1. The paper is well motivated by the point of view of human learning. I really liked the abstract and introduction! 2. I liked the recurrent self-organizing network presentation and usage. Weaknesses: 1. While the paper is well motivated, I believe that the presence of multisensory expectation learning depends heavily on the type of multisensory data. For some modalities such as audio, it is clear what the mapping to language is (audio-to-language transcribing). For language-to-audio, there are multiple audio translations depending on the different tone of voice used by each person. Image-to-audio translation is also a one-to-many mapping. So I have concerns about how the model would work in these cases depending on the data used. 2. I don't believe that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results: from Table 1, image classification performance is outperformed by Inception V3, and for both modalities, I'm not sure why the authors did not compare with more recent baselines. The best audio baseline is from 2016... 3. It seems that this approach needs paired multisensory data for training, which limits the amount of training data as compared to unisensory models. Also, what if some sensors are noisy or missing? Is this model robust to such cases? Questions to authors: 1. Refer to weakness points. 2. Can you comment on when you think multisensory expectation learning would work, and when it wouldn't? What types of data do we need, and from which modalities/sensors?

When applied to audio translation , for example , expectation learning would have to be modeled on a different spectrum . We focus on the multisensory imagery effect ( as described in our discussion ) , which explains how humans simplify the understanding of absent stimuli when reconstructing it based on an expected idea . For example , while reading a text we can imagine the prosodic characteristics of a child 's voice or an adult voice , for example . But would be very hard to recreate the exact tone , pitch , and accent of a specific child or a specific adult . The multisensory imagery effect allows humans to fast-process multisensory information , and , most importantly , to modulate different decision-making processes when one of the sensory information is absent or corrupted . Our approach for expectation learning would not be feasible for precise reconstruction of information , but for prototype learning of multisensory concepts . As demonstrated by our experiment , our solution would fit the modeling of two-way sensory mapping information . The implication is that our model would be able to be used with similar audio/visual tasks , i.e.as prosodic characteristics of voice and face expressions , sounds and objects , and environment sounds and events . Following our findings on the representation-level association , our model would also be suitable for learning of mappings between higher-abstraction level concepts as soon as it can represent such concepts , i.e.an action with a consequence ( close the door , expect a loud noise ) , a sensory feeling with an semantic context ( I feel it is warm , so I must reduce the heating level ) . 2.R : We focused on demonstrating that the expected learning can be used to improve unisensory recognition for absent stimuli .

First, the visual and auditory inputs are autoencoded, and these latent codes are binding using a recurrent self-organizing network (Gamma-GWR). Furthermore, the authors proposed the expectation learning idea, which is inspire by psychology literature. In short, after the first pass of training using the real data. The authors fine tuned the model to bind the real data from one domain and the reconstructed data from another domain. This could be a good idea, as the authors pointed out, human usually bind all kinds of yellow bird to a same mental 'chirping' sounds. So, this expectation learning could potentially group the representation to a canonical one. Also, the authors showed in Table 1 that with the expectation learning, the model's recognition accuracy is improved a bit. I think it would be interesting to show the reconstruction output example (as in Fig. 3) for both model with and without expectation learning. To see if it is as the authors claim, that the model with expectation learning is reconstructing the missing modality with more canonical images/sounds.

We would include this on future work , as our focus on this paper was on the expectation learning mechanism . Typos : 1. page 2 , 2nd line : a online -- > an online 2 . Use subscript I-1 to mean the winner neuron at t-1 , I think this is not quite clear . I suggest to follow the notation in ( Parisi & Wermter 2017 ) , use I ( t-1 ) , which is easier to follow . 3. page 7 , 2nd line : more than 17 % for audio . - > for vision . 4. page 8 , 3rd line : not on the original high-abstraction data . Do the authors mean highly specific data ? That seems make more sense . 5.Several notation mismatch here and there . for example , in formula 6 it is w_j^s , but in the text below it become w_ { j , s } . R : Thank you for your feedback . We updated the general readability of the paper regarding improving language and avoiding typos . In particular , we fixed the notation problems ."}}
