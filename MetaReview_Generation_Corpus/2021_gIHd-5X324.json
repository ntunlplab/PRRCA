The definition of variance is flawed . The formulation does n't match with the figure illustration and code implementation . - A1 : The variance shown in Fig 1 is to illustrate that the variance caused by __different teachers__ is similar to the variance caused by __different training datasets__ . The figure is inspired by the book [ 1 ] and a blog post [ 2 ] . If we train a model , the chosen training dataset is a sampling from the ground-truth data distribution . Then different choices of training dataset introduce variance . Similarly , in our definition of variance , we think the selection of a teacher network introduces randomness . With different teacher networks , we will have different soft labels , so the final performance will be different . Our implementation is to investigate the sample-wise bias-variance caused by distillation . The corresponding implementation is like the practice of tuning the model complexity we use in machine learning . For example , given a training dataset , we need to decide to use a linear regression model or a quadric regression . Since increasing model complexity leads to a larger variance , the quadric regression has a larger variance than the linear regression . Note that in this process , we do not estimate the variance by using multiple training datasets . This is because the variance describes how much the model predictions will change if the training set changes . In our paper , bias and variance are also decomposed from the generalization error , and decrease one will increase another . __So in our implementation , we do not estimate the variance__ , which is similar to choosing a linear regression model or a quadric regression for a machine learning task . __Overall , our code implementation matches our algorithm and problem formulation.__ We revised Figure 1 to avoid misleading presentations . The teachers in the figure are changed to soft label sets , which are more consistent with the variance illustrated in [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] . Finally , thanks for this helpful comment .

As mentioned in our paper , the weighting form is inspired by previous practice that verified useful ( Lin et al. , 2017 ; Tang et al. , 2019 ) . In fact , we have tried other straightforward weighting schemes . Since the weight should be a number between $ [ 0,1 ] $ and $ \\frac { L_ { ce } ^s } { L_ { ce } ^t } $ is the input , a baseline idea is that we can use sigmoid to do this . Note that $ \\frac { L_ { ce } ^s } { L_ { ce } ^t } $ is always bigger than 0 , so the weight needs scaling and can be defined as $ \\frac { 2 } { 1+\\exp ( -\\frac { L_ { ce } ^s } { L_ { ce } ^t } ) } -1 $ .

Therefore , although the proposed weighting form is not mathematically optimal , the not-too-big or not-too-small weights for these regularization examples are not hard to tune . These results verify our main contribution that there is a sample-wise bias-variance tradeoff and we need to assign weights to the regularization examples .

Our employed BVD is directly from the results in [ Heskes 1998 ] . We add new words in the paper to emphasize the relation and include [ Giorgio Valentini 2004 ] as well .

We add the following experiments : 1 ) Gradually excluding regularization samples and 2 ) Gradually adding non-regularization samples while regularization samples are kept . For adding or excluding a sample , we set a probability to achieve this goal . For example , if during training , a sample is marked as a regularization sample according to the value of $ a $ and $ b $ , we backward the loss of this sample by a probability $ p $ . In this way , we can gradually change the training settings . Specifically , the setting is teaching WRN-40-1 with WRN-40-2 and the results are as follows : |excluding all regularization|excluding 0.75 regularization|excluding 0.50 regularization|excluding 0.25 regularization| ||||| |74.59|74.63|74.72|74.87| The other results are |only on regularization|adding 0.25 non-regularization|adding 0.50 non-regularization|add 0.75 non-regularization| ||||| |73.86|74.12|74.47|74.71| For the above tables , the values after excluding or adding are the probabilities of excluding or adding this sample .

Therefore , although the proposed weighting form is not mathematically optimal , the not-too-big or not-too-small weights for these regularization examples are not hard to tune . These results verify our main contribution that there is a sample-wise bias-variance tradeoff and we need to assign weights to the regularization examples . The results and discussions are updated in the appendix . - Q3 : The relation ( similarity and difference ) between your employed BVD from [ Heskes 1998 ] and [ Pedro Domingos 2002 ] is not discussed . [ Giorgio Valentini 2004 ] is not even cited , which seems inappropriate . Also , comparing with the variance definition of [ Zitong Yang , 2020 ] , have you tried multiple loss functions and observe the same phenomenon ? - A3 : Thanks for the closely related work . Our employed BVD is directly from the results in [ Heskes 1998 ] . We add new words in the paper to emphasize the relation and include [ Giorgio Valentini 2004 ] as well . We did not try other loss functions , since the scope of this paper is to investigate knowledge distillation , which is defined by KL divergence . We agree that trying other loss functions is an important future direction of this paper ."}, "2": {"review_id": "gIHd-5X324-2", "review_text": "This paper provides a way to research the effect of soft labels in knowledge distillation from the perspective of sample-wise bias-variance tradeoff . Based on some observations about regularization samples , the authors propose the weighted soft labels to handle the tradeoff . Experiments on standard datasets show that the proposed method can improve the standard knowledge distillation . The motivation and logic of the article are clear . Based on the form of rewriting distillation loss into a regularization loss adding the direct training loss , this work introduces the sample-wise bias-variance tradeoff , which help to understand the regularization effect of KD . Despite the weighted soft label method is heuristic , given the simplicity and effectiveness of the proposed method , I think this paper is satisfactory .

We add the following experiments : 1 ) Gradually excluding regularization samples and 2 ) Gradually adding non-regularization samples while regularization samples are kept . For adding or excluding a sample , we set a probability to achieve this goal . For example , if during training , a sample is marked as a regularization sample according to the value of $ a $ and $ b $ , we backward the loss of this sample by a probability $ p $ . In this way , we can gradually change the training settings . Specifically , the setting is teaching WRN-40-1 with WRN-40-2 and the results are as follows : |excluding all regularization|excluding 0.75 regularization|excluding 0.50 regularization|excluding 0.25 regularization| ||||| |74.59|74.63|74.72|74.87| The other results are |only on regularization|adding 0.25 non-regularization|adding 0.50 non-regularization|add 0.75 non-regularization| ||||| |73.86|74.12|74.47|74.71| For the above tables , the values after excluding or adding are the probabilities of excluding or adding this sample . The results further verify our motivation that we need to balance the weights between non-regularization and regularization during training . These results are updated in the appendix . - Q2 : Can the authors give some quantitative results in Table 5 experiments to show how weighted soft labels tune sample-wise bias-variance ? - A2 : Similar to Q1 , we conduct experiments with weighted soft labels for the intermediate states . |excluding all regularization|excluding 0.75 regularization|excluding 0.50 regularization|excluding 0.25 regularization| ||||| |75.35|75.48|75.61|75.72| and |only on regularization|adding 0.25 non-regularization|adding 0.50 non-regularization|add 0.75 non-regularization| ||||| |74.46|74.79|75.18|75.53| Compared with the results presented in Q1 , we can observe that weighted soft labels are indeed balancing the sample-wise , not on dataset scale , bias , and variance . The balancing is achieved by lower the weights of regularization samples during training , instead of dropping them . Please let us know if further quantitative results are needed . - Q3 : Can the weighted soft labels be applied to the variants of KD ?
