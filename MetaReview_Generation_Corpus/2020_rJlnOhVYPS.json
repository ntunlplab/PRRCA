The manuscript is revised accordingly , and the responses to your main concerns are listed below . [ QUESTION 1 ] The paper lacks a survey of works on handling noisy labels . [ RESPONSE 1 ] We incorporate more related works on handling noisy labels in Section 2 marked as blue . Besides , we also experimentally compared with the most relevant method , Co-teaching ( Han et al. , NIPS 2018 ) , mentioned by the reviewer on unsupervised person re-ID settings . The results in Table 1 show that our method is significantly better than Co-teaching by at least 6 % mAP with the same ResNet-50 backbone . Implementation details and further analysis are presented in Section 4.3 . Co-teaching could not tackle the real-world challenges in unsupervised person re-ID since it is designed for general close-set recognition problems with manually generated label noise . More importantly , it does not explore how to mitigate the label noises for the triplet loss as our method does . [ QUESTION 2 ] Why the temporal averaging of model parameters prevents the two models from being the same ? [ RESPONSE 2 ] Intuitively , when removing temporal average models , Net 1 is directly trained to approach the predictions of Net 2 with on-the-fly parameters $ \\theta_2^ { ( T-1 ) } $ at iteration $ ( T-1 ) $ . In our MMT , Net 1 is optimized toward the predictions of Net 2 with averaging model parameters $ E^ { ( T ) } [ \\theta_2 ] $ which is ensembled from iteration $ ( 0 ) $ to iteration $ ( T-1 ) $ . Obviously , temporal average models provide more complementary and independent predictions which act as more robust soft pseudo labels in our framework , since the parameters are more de-coupled with larger time intervals . Experimental evidences are shown in Section A.1 . The KL-divergence between predictions of two temporal averaging models is much larger than that of two plain networks during the training . [ QUESTION 3 ] Why are the noisy hard labels used ? What is the performance when only soft labels are used for model updates ? [ RESPONSE 3 ] The noisy hard pseudo labels are utilized since the hard classification loss is the foundation for capturing the target-domain data distributions . The soft labels for classification loss are almost uniform and uninformative at early epochs , since the initial network could not correctly distinguish between different identities on the target domain . Independently training with such smooth and noisy soft pseudo labels , the networks in our framework would soon collapse due to the large bias . With regularization by only soft pseudo labels , i.e.removing both the hard classification loss and the hard triplet loss , the framework totally fails with performances even lower than the pre-trained model on the source domain ( new result in Table 2 denoted as \u201c Baseline+MMT-500 ( only $ \\mathcal { L } ^t_ { sid } $ & $ \\mathcal { L } ^t_ { stri } $ ) \u201d ) . We further investigate the contributions of the hard classification loss and hard triplet loss in our proposed framework separately . The experimental results are shown in Table 2 ( marked in blue ) and we observe that the hard classification loss is essential to our framework while the hard triplet loss is not absolutely necessary . Detailed analysis and explanations are listed in Section 4.4 , namely \u201c Necessity of hard pseudo labels in proposed MMT \u201d . [ QUESTION 4 ] Why the weighting factors are different between softmax and triplet losses ? [ RESPONSE 4 ] We empirically searched the weights $ \\lambda^t_ { tri } $ and $ \\lambda^t_ { id } $ on the Duke-to-Market task with $ M_t=500 $ pseudo classes and IBN-ResNet-50 backbone . The searched hyper-parameters are directly used in other settings . From our observation , we found that the soft softmax-triplet loss has larger weight than the soft classification loss , since it is much easier to predict robust soft labels for softmax-triplets , which only has two classes , i.e.positive and negative . To further investigate the influence of $ \\lambda^t_ { tri } $ and $ \\lambda^t_ { id } $ , additional experiments are conducted in Section A.2 during rebuttal . We claim that our framework is not sensitive to the weighting factors as we outperform state-of-the-arts with all tested hyper-parameters , except when the hard classification loss is eliminated ( $ \\lambda^t_ { id } =1.0 $ ) .
