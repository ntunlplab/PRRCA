However , the main concern remains the lack of empirical validation , even on toy examples , showing that ( or whether ) the derived theory here goes beyond a hypothetical thought exercise and can be implemented in practice . It should n't be difficult to provide such examples , assuming the proposed approach does indeed work as indicated by the theory developed here , and without such examples , the paper seems rather incomplete . Therefore , unfortunately , my score remains unchanged at this point , although I would like to encourage the authors to keep pursuing this direction . * * Initial review : * * This manuscript discusses a hypothetical pooling approach that recursively applies a generic ( unspecified ) GNN to subgraph constructed from local neighborhoods of a certain radius ( or sequence of them , applied in successive applications of the recursion ) in an input graph . The main motivation set out by this work is to prove that , under some assumptions ( which may or may not be realistic ) on the applied GNNs , this pooling strategy is sufficiently expressive to admit a configuration of weights that would enable counting subgraphs of certain size in the main input graph . The authors provide theoretical study of this expressivity and prove the capability to count subgraphs in an existence sense . That is , they show there exists some function that can be written in the form of their proposed pooling architecture ( with sufficiently rich architecture between pooled levels ) such that non isomorphic subgraphs would necessarily be distinguishable by some of the extracted features , and thus counting equivalency classes of these features would provide the desired subgraph counting . The authors also provide other results showing functions written in the form of their pooling based architecture have reasonable complexity of node operations , and providing some lower bound on the capability of any GNN approach to count subgraphs , thus putting their theoretical results in context . The proposed pooling approach itself is rather straight forward , but intuitively makes sense . Given an input sequence of radii , at each iteration of the recursion each node in the graph constructs a subgraph over nodes that are within the current considered radius in the sequence . Then , by recursion , the same approach is applied to each of these subgraphs , with the remainder of the radii sequence ( subsequent to the current one ) being passed on , until reaching only a single radius or a single node as stopping conditions . Given the resulting ( sub ) graph features for each node , these are combined with the input node features via generic functions parametrized by unspecified neural networks ( written as an MLP with arbitrary architecture for the sake of presenting pseudocode in the supplement ) that are supposed to be injective , when carefully examining the derivation and proofs in the supplement . Finally , the resulting node features are aggregated together ( again , via generic functions modeled as unspecified neural networks that are supposed to be injective , this time up to node permutation ) into graph features that provide a readout to be returned as the output of the network to outer levels of the recursion , or finally to the general output of the network . It seems to me that the main theoretical results here crucially hinge on the injectivity assumption , and yet the authors make no attempt to verify that any existing GNN indeed provides an architecture that satisfies their assumed conditions . More importantly , they do not provide any empirical evidence that the approach described here is viable in practice . There is no implementation or demonstration of this approach , even on toy examples , let alone benchmarks on graph datasets . There is also no discussion on the impact of the proposed pooling on the training of the resulting RNP-GNN . It is not clear to me that this approach is feasible to apply in practice , beyond a hypothetical thought experiment . Therefore , while this line of research seems like an interesting direction , I find it somewhat lackluster and do not thing it is mature enough at this stage to be accepted for publication . Finally , as a minor remark , the writing here seems somewhat rushed , with several typos and unclear phrases .

Here , we provide replies to the questions . Q : What exactly is the sparsity assumption , and how would one node with large degree affect the complexity ? A : Indeed , one of the theoretical benefits of RNP-GNNs is that for sparse graphs , they only need a close to linear number of node updates . The definition of `` sparse '' here is a restriction on the maximum degree of all nodes in the graph . If the graph has only few nodes with larger degree , we may have two cases : 1 ) The local neighborhood sizes collapse after a few iterations , then the overall complexity is still better than the worst case complexity . 2 ) The local neighborhood sizes remain large . In fact , if the limitation is on the average degree ( not the max degree ) , then , in general , it is impossible to guarantee anything better . To clarify this observation and put it in context , we added a discussion of existing complexity results , and relate them to our results ( Section 8 ) . In particular , recent results in complexity ( Gishboliner et al . ( 2020 ) ; Bera et al . ( 2019 ) ) show that if only the average degree of the input graph is constant , e.g. , if we only have a few vertices with large degree , then no algorithm can count substructures in guaranteed linear time . This implies that our results are close to optimal . Q : Would any vertex cover suffice for the proof ? A : For Theorem 1 , any valid vertex covering sequence works . Having a minimum $ r_1 $ is not required . We clarified this in the revised paper , and also added a simple algorithm for obtaining a covering sequence from a spanning tree of the graph , in Appendix D : 1 ) Compute a spanning tree , e.g. , an MST in time $ O ( n \\log ( n ) ) $ . 2 ) Construct a vertex covering sequence by iteratively picking a leaf of the tree , adding it to the sequence , and removing it from the tree . This way , the remaining graph is guaranteed to remain connected . 3 ) To obtain a valid covering sequence for this vertex covering sequence , each time one selects a leaf , one computes the farthest distance to any neighbor in the tree ( this is an upper bound but valid ) . If we want the covering sequence with minimum $ r_1 $ , then we first search for the node that has the smallest distance to its farthest neighbor , and enforce that to be the first leaf to be pruned .

To this effect , the authors propose a principled neighborhood pooling strategy and theoretically characterize their expressive power - with respect to other models proposed earlier . More specifically , the authors propose a recursive neighborhood pooling strategy which characterizes graphs based on the counts of subgraphs . Furthermore , they show that if the tuple of recursion parameters are chosen well , their proposed model can capture all induced subgraphs ( universality ) of sizes smaller than the first value in the tuple of recursion parameters plus 1 - and show a relationship to the reconstruction conjecture ( Kelly et al.1957 ) .The authors also provide a bound on the number of iterations required to learn the expressive representations . Pros : 1.Theoretical contributions which provide a strategy to learn expressive representations with the ability to count subgraphs and distinguish graphs based on the same . 2.Proposed model provides a strategy to perform a tradeoff on the exponential nature required to compute sugraphs in earlier works . 3.Comprehensive literature review Concerns : 1 . The theorems all state that , there exists a set of recursion parameters , etc - but do not provide a computationally tractable strategy to determine the same for real world graphs ( e.g.diameters of the graph > 15 ) - or a strategy to determine the vertex covering sequence if it exists - which is the basis for theorem 1 ( among all permutations of the set $ \\mathcal { S } $ - without looking over all permutations - this can explode even with subgraphs of size 10 for instance ) . 2.Lack of any experimental evidence to empirically show gains - While the authors explicitly say that their work is theoretical , they could have included synthetic experiments to demonstrate the same- given that the Local Relational Pooling , k-WL works and k-IGN ( the latter two , which are exponential ) works have experimental results .

To this effect , the authors propose a principled neighborhood pooling strategy and theoretically characterize their expressive power - with respect to other models proposed earlier . More specifically , the authors propose a recursive neighborhood pooling strategy which characterizes graphs based on the counts of subgraphs . Furthermore , they show that if the tuple of recursion parameters are chosen well , their proposed model can capture all induced subgraphs ( universality ) of sizes smaller than the first value in the tuple of recursion parameters plus 1 - and show a relationship to the reconstruction conjecture ( Kelly et al.1957 ) .The authors also provide a bound on the number of iterations required to learn the expressive representations . Pros : 1.Theoretical contributions which provide a strategy to learn expressive representations with the ability to count subgraphs and distinguish graphs based on the same . 2.Proposed model provides a strategy to perform a tradeoff on the exponential nature required to compute sugraphs in earlier works . 3.Comprehensive literature review Concerns : 1 . The theorems all state that , there exists a set of recursion parameters , etc - but do not provide a computationally tractable strategy to determine the same for real world graphs ( e.g.diameters of the graph > 15 ) - or a strategy to determine the vertex covering sequence if it exists - which is the basis for theorem 1 ( among all permutations of the set $ \\mathcal { S } $ - without looking over all permutations - this can explode even with subgraphs of size 10 for instance ) . 2.Lack of any experimental evidence to empirically show gains - While the authors explicitly say that their work is theoretical , they could have included synthetic experiments to demonstrate the same- given that the Local Relational Pooling , k-WL works and k-IGN ( the latter two , which are exponential ) works have experimental results . If the concerns are addressed , I will be happy to update my scores .", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Thank you very much for your detailed reading , feedback and support . Here , we provide replies to the questions . Q : How can we compute covering sequences ? A : Thank you for pointing this out , we clarified this question by adding an algorithm for computing a covering sequence in Appendix D , and now summarize the strategy in the main paper too . One simple way to obtain a covering sequence for a given graph is as follows : 1 ) Compute a spanning tree , e.g. , an MST in time $ O ( n \\log ( n ) ) $ . 2 ) Construct a vertex covering sequence by iteratively picking a leaf of the tree , adding it to the sequence , and removing it from the tree . This way , the remaining graph is guaranteed to remain connected . 3 ) To obtain a valid covering sequence for this vertex covering sequence , each time one selects a leaf , one computes the farthest distance to any neighbor in the tree ( this is an upper bound but valid ) . The theorem works with any valid covering sequence . If we want the covering sequence with minimum $ r_1 $ , then we first search for the node that has the smallest distance to its farthest neighbor , and enforce that to be the first leaf to be pruned .

To this end , the authors proposed a recursive neighborhood pooling graph neural network and proved the express power of the model . The universal approximation results on a subgraph have been shown as well . Analysis of computational complexity shows the algorithm is much efficient than the known class of models that can count substructures . The strength of this paper is the detailed theoretical analysis of the proposed method . The analysis has been taken from multiple perspectives : model complexity , computational complexity , and theoretic lower-bound on the class of the proposed method . The paper gives a new insight into measuring the representation power of graph neural networks through subgraph counting . Although subgraph counting is an interesting problem from a theoretical viewpoint , the weakness of this paper is that it is not answered how relevant it is to real-world tasks and how successful it is . Since this is the first paper proposing a new way of measuring the express power of the graph neural network , it would have been much better if there 's some discussion on this point .", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Thank you for reading the paper and for your feedback . Below we address your questions . Q : Relevance of subgraph counting A : In general , given the great interest in graph representation learning , the question of characterizing the tradeoffs between the expressive power and the computational complexity of graph neural networks is of interest to the community , as shown by several recent works on higher-order GNNs , e.g. , references ( Morris et al. , 2019 ; Maron et al. , 2019 ; Chen et al . ( 2020 ) ) in the paper , and the open question [ 1 ] . In this paper , we address this question for the problem of counting subgraphs . The counting problem is motivated by recent works showing that low-order message passing GNNs can not learn it [ 2,3 ] . Counting subgraphs is important , for instance , in computational chemistry , drug design and materials science , to identify functional groups in molecules that are relevant for properties and reactivity . In addition , recent works in that area ( e.g . [ 4 ] ) have used motifs ( subgraphs ) as building blocks . [ 1 ] H. Maron , H. Ben-Hamu , Y. Lipman .
