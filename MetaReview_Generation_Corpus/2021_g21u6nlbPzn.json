The GFLOPs indeed can not completely reflect the actual speed of each model , particularly on GPUs . Following R2 \u2019 s suggestion , we add the \u201c speed \u201d ( measured in terms of clip/second , which denotes the number of video clips that are processed in one second ) column to most of our tables in the revised version . We created the environment with PyTorch 1.6 , CUDA 11.0 , and a single NVIDIA TITAN RTX ( 24GB ) GPU as our testbed . Although we devise our framework mainly based on the efficiency in terms of FLOPs , our method still has advantages regarding actual speed . For instance , for the I3D_v2 model with 16 frames on the action recognition task , our method boosts its speed by 21.7 % ( 141.7 clip/second vs 116.4 clip/second ) . Likewise , for the R ( 2+1 ) D model with 16 frames , our method boosts its speed by 10.6 % ( 108.7 clip/second vs 97.1 clip/second ) ( Table 2 in the revised version ) . * * ( b ) Differences in search w.r.t X3D . * * Our search strategy is completely different from X3D in three different aspects . * * ( a ) Objective of searching . * * What X3D searches for is a fixed optimal combination of temporal stride , channel width , input resolution and model depth . On the other hand , we search for a policy which dynamically predicts the ratio of features which are redundant for each input instance so that we can replace them with cheaply-obtained features . In other words , our proposed approach makes decisions on a per-input basis , leading to different amounts of computation for different videos , in contrast to the one-size-fits-all scheme used by X3D . * * ( b ) Searching methodology . * * X3D follows a heuristic searching methodology , which gradually expands the dimension of each factor and manually compares models with different expanded factors . However , our method utilizes a learning-based searching methodology , which adopts light-weight policy layers with the efficiency loss to learn to decide how many features are needed . * * ( c ) Searching direction . * * X3D starts searching from an efficient simple base model with gradually increasing FLOPs . However , our method starts from a redundant base model and searches to reduce the FLOPs . Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that our dynamic approach achieves 16 % reduction in computation over X3D without any performance loss , for video action recognition tasks . Besides X3D , our approach also outperforms R2+1D , I3D , TPN , CorrNet in both accuracy and efficiency , which shows that our approach is model-agnostic , and hence can be served as a plugin operation for a wide range of action recognition architectures . * * ( c ) Motivation and contribution of efficiency loss . * * The goal of our paper is to customize the dynamic network architecture with the minimal computation for each input instance . Specifically , the core idea of this paper is that we want to dynamically decide how many features should be replaced by the cheaply-obtained feature . Thus the motivation of devising our efficiency loss is to maximize the ratio of cheaply-obtained features during the training phase , which is a necessary part of the whole VA-RED^2 framework . And the contribution of the efficiency loss is that it significantly reduces the computational cost as can be seen from Table 9 of the main paper ."}, {"review_id": "g21u6nlbPzn-1", "review_text": "This paper proposes a novel framework called $ \\text { VA-RED } ^2 $ to reduce spatial and temporal features to be computed for video understanding , which can reduce FLOPs when inferencing the video but remains the performance .

On the other hand , our method focuses on reducing the temporal redundancy among the features of a series of consecutive frames and the spatial redundancy among a set of output features by replacing the redundant features with cheaply-obtained features . Thus , our method and AR-Net are fundamentally quite different as AR-Net does not reconstruct redundant feature maps using cheap linear operations . * * ( b ) Model memory . * * AR-Net adopts several independent networks corresponding to different input resolutions to adaptively infer the video , which makes the model size significantly larger than the original model . While our method integrates all of our possible network architectures into a shared-weight super network , the parameter size of whom is just slightly larger ( almost the same ) than the original model . * * ( c ) Scope of application . * * AR-Net is only applicable to 2D video models , like Temporal Segment Network ( TSN ) . In contrast , our VA-RED^2 framework is model-agnostic and hence can be applied to a wide- variety of action recognition architectures including 2D , ( 2+1 ) D , and 3D video models , like ( R ( 2+1 ) D , X3D , I3D ) . Moreover , while AR-Net is only limited to action recognition , our dynamic framework is generalizable to not only video action recognition but also to spatio-temporal action localization and dense segmentation tasks , achieving promising results over competing methods . * * ( b ) Experimental-level comparison with AR-Net . * * Following the reviewer \u2019 s suggestion , we compare our method with AR-Net using 16-frame TSN ResNet50 on Mini-Kinetics-200 and observe that our method has advantages on the FLOPs , model size , and performance , e.g. , our approach outperforms AR-Net in both top-1 clip accuracy ( 67.2 vs 68.3 ) and FLOPS ( 44.8G vs 43.4G ) , while using about 62 % less parameters ( 63.0M vs 23.9M ) . We have added this result in the updated version ( see Table 4 ( Right ) of the revised paper ) . * * ( c ) Missing references . * * Thanks for pointing out these to us ! We have updated the related work section to reflect these relevant works in the revised version . Besides , we conducted additional experiments of our method with one of these SOTA models , CorrNet [ 1 ] with R ( 2+1 ) D backbone , the results of which are listed in Table 4 ( Left ) of the revised paper . Experimental results show that our dynamic approach outperforms the baseline CorrNet by 1.8 % in top-1 video accuracy ( 68.2 vs 70.0 ) , while reducing the computational cost/FLOPS by 25.2 % ( 60.8G vs 45.5G ) on Mini-Kinetics-200 dataset . * * ( d ) VA-RED^2 with dense video understanding tasks . * * Our adaptive approach for redundancy reduction is a general framework which can be applied to different types of video tasks , not limited to action recognition . Specifically , our method can be applied to dense video understanding tasks , like video semantic understanding , as long as there exists redundancy in the temporal or channel dimension of videos . To prove this , we conducted an experiment by applying our method to a semantic segmentation model to remove the channel-wise redundancy . The results are reported in Table 11 in our updated paper . The experiments are conducted on ADE20K dataset [ 2 ] with the PSPNet [ 3 ] , where we choose the dilated ResNet-18 as our backbone architecture . We can see that our method significantly boosts the efficiency of the segmentation model as our method can save around 26.4 % computational cost of the original model while maintaining the accuracy .
