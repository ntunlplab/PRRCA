{"year": "2021", "forum": "kKwFlM32HV5", "title": "Natural World Distribution via Adaptive Confusion Energy Regularization", "decision": "Reject", "meta_review": "The authors address the problem of fine-grained image classification. They propose a batch based regularizer, called the batch confusion norm (BCN), to encourage less over confident predictions. They also tackle the problem of class imbalance during training by adaptively weighting the BCN loss at the class level to take the imbalances in the underlying label distributions into account. Results are presented on four different fine-grained datasets.  \n\nOverall, while the reviewers had some positive comments, there was not broad support for the paper. There are questions that need to be resolved related to the evaluation e.g. the best performing model uses GASPP, however there is no reported GASPP variant for the PC baseline. Similarly, it would be valuable to know how much PC would benefit from an additional class imbalance term in the iNaturalist2018 results. Given that the proposed regularizer builds on PC (Dubey et al.), it is very important that the authors provide a like-for-like comparison so that readers can better understand the merits of the proposed method.  \n\nThere were also concerns with the presentation of the paper e.g. several typos (which can be easily fixed), issues with the clarity of the text (which require more work), and uninformative figures (e.g. Fig 2 should be revised to more clearly illustrate the differences between the three methods shown). The authors are encouraged to revise the text to resolve these problems. \n\nWhile the paper has some strengths (e.g. the empirical performance on some of the tasks is promising and the method is conceptually simple), there are still a number of concerns from the reviewers e.g. a lack of a clear motivation as to why the proposed method works, and why it is conceptually better than existing alternatives (e.g. PC). Given this lack of support, it is not possible to recommend the paper in its current form. \n", "reviews": [{"review_id": "kKwFlM32HV5-0", "review_text": "* * Summary : * * This paper is about fine-grained visual classification , which is challenging due to high inter-class similarity , high intra-class variation and potentially also class imbalance .

This regularization shares the motivation with prior art to confuse the network and reduce over-fitting by making all predictions within a mini-batch similar to each other .

I think the paper lacks a clear justification about using BCN as a way to treat posterior distributions without using statistical or probabilistic methods . [ A1 ] .Inter-class similarity between each category is the main challenging term in FGVC . Therefore , the proposed BCN is a confusion regularization that tries to equip the model with the ability to capture the inter-class similarity automatically . Hence , it is not a posterior distribution . [ Q2 ] .BCN is conditioned to operate if the classes in the batch are unique . However , satisfying this condition in practice can be challenging . This becomes challenging when dealing with long-tailed datasets . What is the optimal/efficient way to guarantee a batch that satisfies this constraint ? If the constraint is not satisfied , can BCN provide bad gradients because repeated classes with different posteriors in different columns can double its contribution ? [ A2 ] .The classes in a batch are unique is an assumption in the most extreme cases . On the other hand , few of classes in a batch have the same label is a normal condition . For instance , if two predictions have a similar probability distribution , the BCN loss between them becomes very small . In other words , same labels with small loss is intuitive . Hence , we do not make any restriction for generating each batch at the training time . [ Q3 ] .The extension of adding a matrix A is simple and feels a bit ad hoc . What is the intuition behind the matrix A in terms of the norm ? Can the matrix A be considered a way to ` weight a posterior as a function of the statistics ? [ A3 ] .The matrix A tries to control the confusion magnitude . For example , frequent categories has more instances to prevent a stronger confusion energy , and rare categories is opposite . Intuitively , we formulate the adaptive matrix A by the training data statistics . Hence , the matrix A is an adaptive confusion term , not a posterior mechanism . [ Q4 ] .While I am pleased to see that the paper uses datasets depicting real scenes ( e.g. , iNaturalist , CUB , CAR , etc . ) , the experiments only focus on using one family of networks : ResNet . Does this method operate well on other more modern architectures , e.g. , EfficientNet or MobileNetV2 ? [ A4 ] .Yes , it still operates well on not only the ResNet series but also the EfficientNet , DenseNet , VGG , etc .

If the constraint is not satisfied , can BCN provide bad gradients because repeated classes with different posteriors in different columns can double its contribution ? [ A2 ] .The classes in a batch are unique is an assumption in the most extreme cases . On the other hand , few of classes in a batch have the same label is a normal condition . For instance , if two predictions have a similar probability distribution , the BCN loss between them becomes very small . In other words , same labels with small loss is intuitive . Hence , we do not make any restriction for generating each batch at the training time . [ Q3 ] .The extension of adding a matrix A is simple and feels a bit ad hoc . What is the intuition behind the matrix A in terms of the norm ? Can the matrix A be considered a way to ` weight a posterior as a function of the statistics ? [ A3 ] .The matrix A tries to control the confusion magnitude . For example , frequent categories has more instances to prevent a stronger confusion energy , and rare categories is opposite . Intuitively , we formulate the adaptive matrix A by the training data statistics . Hence , the matrix A is an adaptive confusion term , not a posterior mechanism . [ Q4 ] .While I am pleased to see that the paper uses datasets depicting real scenes ( e.g. , iNaturalist , CUB , CAR , etc . ) , the experiments only focus on using one family of networks : ResNet . Does this method operate well on other more modern architectures , e.g. , EfficientNet or MobileNetV2 ? [ A4 ] .Yes , it still operates well on not only the ResNet series but also the EfficientNet , DenseNet , VGG , etc . In the powerful model , the results of EfficientNet-B7 from baseline , PC , and BCN approach are 70.9 , 69.8 , and 74.1 , respectively . The improvement of our approach is consistent with other networks . For the sake of the fair comparison to the other approaches , our main paper follows the most commonly used network , ResNet series , to report the experimental results . [ Q5 ] .In terms of baselines , I think the paper is missing recent long-tail methods : a ) Liu , et al.Large-Scale Long-Tailed Recognition in an Open World . CVPR 2019. b ) Cao , et al.Learning Imbalanced Datasets with Label-Distribution-Aware Margin Loss . NeurIPS 2019 . [ A5 ] .We straddle two different domains at the same time , and each of them is the mainstream research direction recently . Hence , due to the limited space , we can only choose a few representative articles in their respective fields . a ) has missed the experiments about iNaturalist which contains fine-grained and long-tailed properties both . We have the comparison with b ) at Table 2 ( b ) LDAM and the citation is located in the second . [ Q6 ] .The results for the long-tail methods are lacking more details . As it is common in various long-tail recognition papers , the paper is not showing performance on head or tail classes . It only shows an overall classification performance . This is misleading as the method can helping more head classes and thus improving the overall classification performance . [ A6 ] .In Figure 3 ( b ) , we have shown the performance on head or tail classes . More details can be found in the captions . [ Q7 ] .Minor concern . [ A7 ] .We can only say that this article is entirely our own work , without any plagiarism ."}, "3": {"review_id": "kKwFlM32HV5-3", "review_text": "This paper proposes the batch confusion norm ( BCN ) for dealing with both fine-grained recognition and long-tailed recognition simultaneously . Specifically , BCN considers the confusion regularization within each training batch and an adaptive matrix term is designed for handling the long-tailed problem .

[ A1 ] .1 ) In our paper , we try to address the fine-grained and long-tailed problems at the same time . The point of view we choose is \u201c confusion energy \u201d . The main idea of confusion energy is making the model learn the inter-class similarity and prevent the overfitting issue . Moreover , different from pairwise confusion ( PC ) , we make the confusion efficiently from the prediction of each batch . Hence , our method starts by minimizing the rank of the prediction matrix . 2 ) The adaptive matrix A tries to control the confusion magnitude for each category . Hence , when $ i = j $ , it means that we only control the confusion magnitude on each class individually .

[ A2 ] .1 ) Firstly , we straddle two different domains at the same time , and each of them is the mainstream research direction recently . Second , we achieve a competitive performance without any data sampling methods or any additional model parameters . Third , we solve the problems by a very special point , confusion energy . Our significant improvement is against PC or baseline . In conclusion , this paper tries to introduce to everyone that we can address fine-grained and long-tailed problems by the confusion energy way . Furthermore , the training process shows that it is practical and the experimental results present the competitive performance . 2 ) We solve the problems from a very different concept . [ ref1-ref3 ] try to capture the discriminative parts by the network design . All of them need a larger model size and a complex training process . [ ref4-ref5 ] only focus on the long-tailed problem . And the performance in ref4 , as we all know , is hard to reproduce . [ Q3 ] .Minor issues .
