However , Chen et al distill not only the feature but also the classification logits and bounding box regression results , which has limited their application scenes in one stage and anchor-free models . Li et al.and Wang et al.distill the features in the regions of proposals and near object anchor locations , respectively . As a result , their methods rely on the supervision of anchors and ground truths and ca n't be utilized in one stage and anchor free models . Bajestani & Yang 's method is utilized for active perception on video data , which can not be utilized in image-based detection . In contrast , in our method , the attention mask and relation information can be easily generated from the backbone features , which has no requirements on ground truths , anchors or proposals . As a result , it can be easily used in different kinds of models and tasks without any modification . * * Comparison on Motivation * * Chen et al . 's method is a direct application of knowledge distillation on object detection . The other three methods and our method are motivated by the imbalance between foreground and background pixels and these methods try to address this issue by reweighting the distillation loss . Besides , our method is also motivated by the effect of the relation among pixels in an image , which is ignored by the other methods . | Method | Motivation 1 : Imbalance between foreground and background | Motivation 2 : Lack of Relation Distillation | | : -- : | : - : | : -- : | |Our Method |\u221a|\u221a| |Chen et al. , 2017|\u00d7|\u221a| |Li et al. , 2017 |\u221a|\u00d7| |Wang et al.2019 |\u221a|\u00d7| |Bajestani & Yang , 2020 |\u221a| \u00d7| * * Question2 . About the attention in attention-guided distillation . * * * * What does it capture ? * * The attention captures the crucial pixels in the feature map . For example , as shown in Figure.3 , most of the pixels with high attention value focus on the head , legs , and eyes of the horses while the pixels of the background have much lower attention value . The attention here is generated by summing the absolute value of features in the channel dimension . As a result , the pixel which has a larger absolute value will have a larger attention value . Note that this observation has been also utilized and discussed in [ 1-2 ] . The visualization and distribution of attention have been provided in Figure3 . * * Failure case . * * The attention in attention-guided distillation may fail in a few specific cases . For example , in Figure3 , some pixels in the tree also have high attention value . But these failure attention cases are much less than the correct cases and thus they will not introduce much negative influence during knowledge distillation .

As a result , their methods rely on the supervision of anchors and ground truths and ca n't be utilized in one stage and anchor free models . Bajestani & Yang 's method is utilized for active perception on video data , which can not be utilized in image-based detection . In contrast , in our method , the attention mask and relation information can be easily generated from the backbone features , which has no requirements on ground truths , anchors or proposals . As a result , it can be easily used in different kinds of models and tasks without any modification . * * Comparison on Motivation * * Chen et al . 's method is a direct application of knowledge distillation on object detection . The other three methods and our method are motivated by the imbalance between foreground and background pixels and these methods try to address this issue by reweighting the distillation loss . Besides , our method is also motivated by the effect of the relation among pixels in an image , which is ignored by the other methods . | Method | Motivation 1 : Imbalance between foreground and background | Motivation 2 : Lack of Relation Distillation | | : -- : | : - : | : -- : | |Our Method |\u221a|\u221a| |Chen et al. , 2017|\u00d7|\u221a| |Li et al. , 2017 |\u221a|\u00d7| |Wang et al.2019 |\u221a|\u00d7| |Bajestani & Yang , 2020 |\u221a| \u00d7| * * Question2 . About the attention in attention-guided distillation . * * * * What does it capture ? * * The attention captures the crucial pixels in the feature map . For example , as shown in Figure.3 , most of the pixels with high attention value focus on the head , legs , and eyes of the horses while the pixels of the background have much lower attention value . The attention here is generated by summing the absolute value of features in the channel dimension . As a result , the pixel which has a larger absolute value will have a larger attention value . Note that this observation has been also utilized and discussed in [ 1-2 ] . The visualization and distribution of attention have been provided in Figure3 . * * Failure case . * * The attention in attention-guided distillation may fail in a few specific cases . For example , in Figure3 , some pixels in the tree also have high attention value . But these failure attention cases are much less than the correct cases and thus they will not introduce much negative influence during knowledge distillation .

It claims that the failure of knowledge distillation in object detection is mainly caused by the imbalance between pixels of foreground and background , and the relation distillation between different pixels . The authors then propose non-local distillation to tackle the problem . Extensive experiments are conducted on MS COCO and verify the effectiveness of the proposed method . 1.Strengthens a . This paper explores the knowledge distillation problem in object detection and gives promising results and conclusions . b.The results with different detectors greatly prove the effectiveness of the method . c. It is good that the distillation method does not bring any extra costs during the inference time . 2.Weaknesses a. I recommend the authors do experiments on much smaller models . For example , in real cases , mimicking ResNet50 with larger models is meaningless . It would be great if we can observe large improvements when mimicking a small backbone with ResNet-50 or even larger models . These conclusions and experiments are crucial for the applications of the method . b.The English writing of this paper can be improved . c. The names of the models in this paper are not proper . It is weird for me to call Faster RCNN101 . Generally , Faster R-CNN is Faster R-CNN , and ResNet is ResNet . You can use any backbones with Faster R-CNN . Please define it as Faster R-CNN with ResNet101 . As stated comments , I think this paper is good for knowledge distillation in object detection and publishable , but encourages the authors improve the draft according to the weaknesses .", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "reply_text": "* * We sincerely appreciate your detailed and thoughtful reviews and hope that our response can address your concerns . * * * * Question1 .
