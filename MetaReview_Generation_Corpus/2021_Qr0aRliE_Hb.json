Building upon a DRL setup where the action at each timestep corresponds to selecting a bit value for each layer , the method adds a `` Q-value indicator '' function Q~ that selects among a set of candidate actions , and filters based on the model performance quantizing the layer to each level .

The method is well described overall , though I would have liked more details on the mu and Q networks including their initializations and how well the mu proposals span the action space initially ( see questions below ) .

We are happy to address them below : * * 1 . The descretized action space only has 8 values per layer . What happens if one evaluates all 8 with the Q~ indicator and remove the candidate generation network ? Is this equivalent to a layerwise greedy search ? What is the final accuracy and quantization speed of this baseline ? * * It is important to notice what the candidate generation networks learn . It is not only the relation that the quantization has with the network accuracy , but also the relation with the size of the network . It is embodied in how the candidate generation networks are trained in the RL . In each episode , first , the Q-value indicator selects the candidate network that gives the highest accuracy for each layer . Note that after selecting the bit values for all the layers , the RL agent adjusts the bit values for each layer to generate a quantized model that * * fulfills the compression ratio requirement * * . It is the accuracy of that quantized model that is used to compute the reward and to train the candidate generation network . So by applying the Q~ indicator on only the candidates generated by the candidate generation networks , the design considers both accuracy and size . So if we remove the candidate generation networks from the design , the selected bit values would be always those that give the highest accuracy . It is hence hard to find a small enough model that fulfills the compression requirement ; enumerating all possibilities would face an exponential search space ( 8^n where n is the number of layers ) . * * 2.How is the last layer of the expanded actor function mu^ initialized ? Randomly , or in such a way that the initial outputs correspond to different discrete bit sizes ? How many candidate actions are there ? How well do the candidate values span the action space to allow for guidance by Q~ , particularly in the beginning episodes ? * * The last layer of the expanded actor function mu^ is initialized randomly . In our experiments , we do observe that , with random initialization , the initial outputs tend to be different in the numbers of bits . ( e.g . [ 1 , 3 , 8 ] , [ 8 , 7 , 2 ] , [ 3 , 8 , 2 ] , [ 5 , 3 , 7 ] , [ 1 , 4 , 2 ] for the first 5 layers of CifarNet . ) In our experiments , we set the number of candidate actions to 3 ( k=3 ) and demonstrate its efficacy . Based on our observations in the experiments , the candidate values span well in the action space . In our experiments , we have 3 candidates per layer . The 3 candidates tend to be different from each other . In the beginning episodes , the candidates for the same layers in two consecutive episodes tend to be different as well . * * 3.Instead of having multiple candidates , is it possible to introduce an output bias per layer in the actor function mu , initialized to the bit sizes determined by greedy profiler search with Q~ ? That is , to use a function mu_l ( s ) = mu ( s ) + b ( l ) , where b ( l ) = argmax_a Q~ ( a ) for each layer l , then use regular DRL ( not ADRL ) with this mu_l that has an initial guess using greedy search from the profiler ? * * If I understand correctly , here the \u2018 greedy profiler search with Q~ \u2019 is similar to the one mentioned in question 1 , which evaluates all the 8 values . If this is the case , the b ( l ) will give the same value for the same layer in each episode and it tends to give larger values as more bits generally leads to higher accuracy . In this way , b ( l ) doesn \u2019 t help the system to learn anything new . If the number of values being evaluated by Q~ is less than 8 , then how to decide which values being evaluated becomes another question . In this case , a multi-candidates actor function would be a better choice .

If more bits generally leads to higher accuracy , what makes the system learn to output smaller bits in its actions ? Both Q~ augmentation and the reward R = acc_quant - acc_orig depend only on accuracy . * * As explained in the answer to Q1 , the system learns to generate bit values with the guidance of both the quantized model accuracy and the model compression ratio . Here is how it generates a network using fewer bits . After the agent selects the bit values for all the layers , it checks whether the quantized network fulfills the compression ratio requirement . If not , it will decrease the bit value layer by layer starting from the one that gives the least accuracy loss until the compression ratio of the quantized network is equal or smaller than the target ratio . Then it evaluates the network accuracy of the compressed network to compute the rewards . The final bit value of each layer forms the state used to train the agent .
