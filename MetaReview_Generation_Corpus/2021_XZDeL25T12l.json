The analysis is done by conducting exploratory experiments. The paper establishes that the distillation data used for training a student can play a critical role in the performance gap apart from the model capacity. Building on this idea, the authors propose a new approach to distillation, KD+, utilizing out-of-distribution data when training a student. Extensive experiments are performed to demonstrate the efficiency of KD+. Overall, the paper studies an interesting problem. The results provide a more in-depth explanation of how the distillation data and model capacity play a role in the performance gap between student and teacher models in KD.\n\nI want to thank the authors for providing the rebuttal and sharing their concerns about the quality of one of the reviews.  The reviewers appreciated the paper's ideas; however, all the reviewers were on the fence with borderline scores. In summary, this is a borderline paper, and unfortunately, the final decision is a rejection. The reviewers have provided detailed and constructive feedback for improving the paper. In particular, the authors should incorporate the reviewers' feedback to better position the work w.r.t. the existing literature and provide clear reasoning behind the gains for KD+ in experiments. This is exciting and potentially impactful work, and we encourage the authors to incorporate the reviewers' feedback when preparing future revisions of the paper.", "reviews": [{"review_id": "XZDeL25T12l-0", "review_text": "The paper studies knowledge distillation .

However , not all out-of-distribution data are beneficial as shown in Appendix D. About more data : as KD+ does both in-distribution and out-of-distribution distillation , it uses more samples . As shown in Table 3 , the performance first increases and then drops a little as the KD+ uses more and more samples in the P set .

The exploratory experiments on out-of-distribution data is interesting , which is meaningful to discuss why the gap between the student and teacher model exists from a new viewpoint of data distribution rather than the student capacity . 2.KD+ achieved promising results . Some concerns : 1 .

This paper fails to compare their results with [ 3 ] or discuss the difference by using a GAN style to learn the output distribution of the teacher . 2.KD+ will sample data on the original training data , so it would result in more training data than KD or other methods . How does the training time change ? The paper fails to discuss training time changes on more training data . 3.The key point of KD+ is to sample from training data $ x $ , while it only gives an illustration figure ( Figure3 ) on one dimension data $ x $ rather than on real images .

It also depends on the model capacity differences \u2026\\ A1 : As stated in Definition 4.2 , if a student can fully memorize the outputs of a teacher on the target task , we call this student as a CST of the teacher . This definition has already considered model capacity differences . Table 1 shows that the widely used students achieve 0.0 memorization error with respect to these teachers on these datasets , which demonstrates that they fully memorize the the outputs of the teachers on these datasets and thus are CSTs of their teachers on these datasets .

And the proposed KD+ is not superior to the approach of [ 1 ] \u2026\\ A3 : Self-Supervision knowledge distillation ( SSKD ) addresses KD from a perspective that is different from ours . They use extra self-supervision tasks to assist KD while KD+ addresses KD from data perspective by going beyond in-distribution distillation . SSKD is not a competitor to KD+ as extra tasks and extra ( freely obtained ) samples are compatible and both beneficial . The real competitor of KD+ is KD as KD+ can be combined with the existing approaches . As stated in the paper , we aims to show KD+ is superior to KD and thus is ready to replace KD by demonstrating that KD+ outperforms KD and is more compatible with the existing approaches ( Table 7 ) . Note that the original KD objective is included in SSKD . We use the strategy in KD+ to assist SSKD . The comparison results are reported as follows . We add also the comparison results to Table 7 in the revised paper . It is observed that SSKD+ outperforms SSKD consistently , which demonstrates that extra tasks and extra data are compatible and both helpful . We also notice that the improvement is not large . The reason is that SSKD has already used strong data augmentation ( i.e. , color dropping , rotation , cropping ) . The success of SSKD also verifies our argument in Corollary 4.1 in the paper that distillation data matters for CSTs when the model capacity differences are unavoidable.\\ \u2014\\ Teacher & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; ResNet32 $ \\times $ 4 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; VGG-13 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; ResNet-50 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; ResNet32 $ \\times $ 4 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; ResNet-110 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; WRN-40-2\\ Student & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; ResNet8 $ \\times $ 4 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; VGG-8 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; VGG-8 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; ShuffleNetV2 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; ResNet-20 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; WRN-16-2\\ \u2014\\ SSKD & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 76.20 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 75.33 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp \\ A4 : The hyper-parameters of different approaches and more details are given in Appendix due to the space limitation .

As the reviewer pointed out , similar data selection strategies have been used in some other applications , e.g. , network calibration , semi-supervised learning , uncertainty estimation , and learning with noise . However , how these freely obtained data and out-of-distribution samples affect the performances of students including CSTs and ISTs in KD based model compression has never been explored . This paper systematically studies this problem and summarizes and shows the relation between the performances of CSTs , ISTs , teachers and the distillation data . The existing literature usually simply attributes the teacher-student performance gap to the model capacity difference . While the model capacity gap is unavoidable in KD based model compression , we find that distillation data can compensate for this gap for CSTs . The key idea and the motivation between them are arguably different . R3 : I also concern about the fairness of Table 4 \u2026\\ A3 : This paper aims to show that distillation data matters when the student capacity is greater than a threshold . Thus , the only difference between KD and KD+ is the distillation dataset . We empirically show that KD+ is superior to KD and even can match the teacher performance , which verifies our argument . Moreover , Mixup aims to enforce local linearity of deep neural networks by linearly interpolating both samples and targets while KD+ aims to make the students better mimic the local shape of the teacher function by exploring the knowledge between two samples . R4 : The last one is the student can outperform to teacher has been studied some literature ? I remember some of the paper point out this.\\ A4 : The existing literature has observed that a student can outperform a teacher when the student capacity is equal to or greater than the teacher capacity , e.g. , Born-Again-Network .

The exploratory experiments on out-of-distribution data is interesting , which is meaningful to discuss why the gap between the student and teacher model exists from a new viewpoint of data distribution rather than the student capacity . 2.KD+ achieved promising results .

A recent KD work [ 3 ] also achieved promising results on ImageNet by adopting a discriminator to judge the output distribution is from the teacher model or student model , I think it shares a similar idea with this work , but it uses GAN-style learning to make student 's output be more like teachers .

How does the training time change ? The paper fails to discuss training time changes on more training data . 3.The key point of KD+ is to sample from training data $ x $ , while it only gives an illustration figure ( Figure3 ) on one dimension data $ x $ rather than on real images .

It also depends on the model capacity differences \u2026\\ A1 : As stated in Definition 4.2 , if a student can fully memorize the outputs of a teacher on the target task , we call this student as a CST of the teacher . This definition has already considered model capacity differences . Table 1 shows that the widely used students achieve 0.0 memorization error with respect to these teachers on these datasets , which demonstrates that they fully memorize the the outputs of the teachers on these datasets and thus are CSTs of their teachers on these datasets .

And the proposed KD+ is not superior to the approach of [ 1 ] \u2026\\ A3 : Self-Supervision knowledge distillation ( SSKD ) addresses KD from a perspective that is different from ours . They use extra self-supervision tasks to assist KD while KD+ addresses KD from data perspective by going beyond in-distribution distillation . SSKD is not a competitor to KD+ as extra tasks and extra ( freely obtained ) samples are compatible and both beneficial . The real competitor of KD+ is KD as KD+ can be combined with the existing approaches . As stated in the paper , we aims to show KD+ is superior to KD and thus is ready to replace KD by demonstrating that KD+ outperforms KD and is more compatible with the existing approaches ( Table 7 ) . Note that the original KD objective is included in SSKD . We use the strategy in KD+ to assist SSKD . The comparison results are reported as follows . We add also the comparison results to Table 7 in the revised paper . It is observed that SSKD+ outperforms SSKD consistently , which demonstrates that extra tasks and extra data are compatible and both helpful . We also notice that the improvement is not large . The reason is that SSKD has already used strong data augmentation ( i.e. , color dropping , rotation , cropping ) . The success of SSKD also verifies our argument in Corollary 4.1 in the paper that distillation data matters for CSTs when the model capacity differences are unavoidable.\\ \u2014\\ Teacher & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; ResNet32 $ \\times $ 4 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; VGG-13 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; ResNet-50 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; ResNet32 $ \\times $ 4 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; ResNet-110 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; WRN-40-2\\ Student & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; ResNet8 $ \\times $ 4 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; VGG-8 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; VGG-8 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; ShuffleNetV2 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; ResNet-20 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; WRN-16-2\\ \u2014\\ SSKD & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 76.20 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 75.33 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp \\ A4 : The hyper-parameters of different approaches and more details are given in Appendix due to the space limitation .

R2 : The second concern is about the novelty of KD+ , the selection \u2026\\ A2 : We add the discussion about these methods to the related work in the revised paper . As the reviewer pointed out , similar data selection strategies have been used in some other applications , e.g. , network calibration , semi-supervised learning , uncertainty estimation , and learning with noise . However , how these freely obtained data and out-of-distribution samples affect the performances of students including CSTs and ISTs in KD based model compression has never been explored . This paper systematically studies this problem and summarizes and shows the relation between the performances of CSTs , ISTs , teachers and the distillation data . The existing literature usually simply attributes the teacher-student performance gap to the model capacity difference . While the model capacity gap is unavoidable in KD based model compression , we find that distillation data can compensate for this gap for CSTs . The key idea and the motivation between them are arguably different . R3 : I also concern about the fairness of Table 4 \u2026\\ A3 : This paper aims to show that distillation data matters when the student capacity is greater than a threshold . Thus , the only difference between KD and KD+ is the distillation dataset . We empirically show that KD+ is superior to KD and even can match the teacher performance , which verifies our argument . Moreover , Mixup aims to enforce local linearity of deep neural networks by linearly interpolating both samples and targets while KD+ aims to make the students better mimic the local shape of the teacher function by exploring the knowledge between two samples . R4 : The last one is the student can outperform to teacher has been studied some literature ? I remember some of the paper point out this.\\ A4 : The existing literature has observed that a student can outperform a teacher when the student capacity is equal to or greater than the teacher capacity , e.g. , Born-Again-Network . However , as stated in the title and the paper , the question studied in the paper is whether students can outperform teachers in KD based model compress , i.e. , the student capacity is less than the teacher \u2019 s . The work is first to systematically study this question and provide the relation between CSTs , ISTs , teachers , and distillation data ."}}
