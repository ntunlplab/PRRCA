It is comparable to-- and to my ears not better than-- existing polyphonic systems such as the ones below (links to sample audio are provided here): -Bachbot - https://soundcloud.com/bachbot (Liang et al 2017) - tied parallel nets - http://www.hexahedria.com/2015/08/03/composing-music-with-recurrent-neural-networks/ (Johnson 2015, ref below) -performanceRNN - https://magenta.tensorflow.org/performance-rnn - (Simon & Oore 2017) ..others as well.. Clarity -- Some of the writing is \"locally\" clear, but one large, poorly-organized section makes the whole thing confusing (details below). It is very helpful that the authors subsequently added a comment with a link to some sample scores; without that, it had been utterly impossible to evaluate the quality. There are a few points that could be better clarified: -p5\u201da multi-hot vector of notes N\u201d. It sounds like N will be used to denote note-numbers, but in fact it seems like N is the total number of notes, i.e. the length of the vector, right? What value of N is used? -p5 \u201ca one-hot vector of durations D\u201d. It sounds like D will be used to denote durations, but actually I think D is the length of the 1-hot vector encoding durations right? What value of D is used, and what durations do the elements of this vector represent? -similarly, does T represent the size of the history? This should really be clarified. -p5 Polyphonic models. -Eq (2), (3), (4): Presumably the h\u2019s are the hidden activations layers? -the networks here correspond to the blue circles in Fig 1, right? If so, make the relationship clear and explicit -Note that most variables in most equations are left undefined -actually defining the W\u2019s in Eq(2-4) would allow the authors to refer to the W\u2019s later (e.g. in Section 5.2) when describing weight-sharing ideas. Otherwise, it\u2019s all rather confusing. For example, the authors could write, \u201cThus, we can set W_p1 = W_p2 = W_p3 = W_p4\u201d (or whatever is appropriate). -Generally, I found that pages 5-7 describe many ideas, and some of them are individually fairly clearly described, but it is not always clear when one idea is beginning, and one idea is ending, and which ideas can be combined or not. On my first readings, I thought that I was basically following it, until I got to Table 5, which then convinced me that I was in fact *not* quite following it. For example, I had been certain that all the networks described are recurrent (perhaps due to Fig1?), but then it turned out that many are in fact *not* recurrent, which made a lot more sense given the continual reference to the history and the length of the model\u2019s Markov window etc. But the reader should not have had to deduce this. For example, one could write, \u201cWe will consider 3 types of architectures: convolutional, recurrent, .... In each architecture, we will have [...] modules, and we will try a variety of combinations of these modules. The modules/components are as follows:\u201d. It\u2019s a bit prosaic, but it can really help the reader. -Appendices, presented well, could be immensely helpful in clarifying the exact architectures; obviously not all 22 architectures from Table 5 need to be shown, but at least a few of them shown explicitly would help clarify. For example, in Fig1, the purple boxes seem to represent notes (according to the caption), but do they actually represent networks? If they really do represent notes, then how can \u201cnotes\u201d receive inputs from both the part-networks and the global network? Also, I was not entirely clear on the relationship of the architecture of the individual nets (for the parts) to that of the global integrating network. E.g. for experiment #20, the part-net is an RNN (with how many layers?? with regular or LSTM cells?) followed by a log-linear predictor (with one hidden layer of 300 units right? or are there multiple layers sometimes?), but then what is the global network? Why does the longest part-history vector appear to have length 10 based on Table 5, but according to Table 3 the best-performing history length was 20? Though, I am not sure the meaning of the \u201cbottom/top\u201d column was explained anywhere, so maybe I am completely misunderstanding that aspect of the table? Etc. -Many piano scores do not easily deconstruct into clean 4-part polyphony; the example in Appendix A is an exception. It was not clear to me how piano scores were handled during training. -Terminology: it is not entirely clear to me why one section is entitled \u201chomophonic models\u201d, instead of just \u201cmonophonic models\u201d. Homophonic music usually involves a melody line that is supported by other voices, i.e. a sort of asymmetry in the part-wise structure. Here, the outputs are quite the opposite of that: the voices are independent, they generally function well together harmonically, and there is usually no sense of one voice containing a melody. If there\u2019s some reason to call it homophonic, that would be fine, but otherwise it doesn\u2019t really serve to clarify anything. However, the authors do say that the homophonic composition tasks are a \u201cminor generalization of classic monophonic composition tasks\u201d, so this suggests to me that there is something here that I am not quite understanding. The last sentence of Section 5.3 is very confusing-- I don\u2019t understand what lin_n is, or 1_n is, or how to read the corresponding entries of the table. The first part of the paragraph is fairly clear. Table 4: \u201cThe first row\u201d actually seems like it is referring to the second row. I know what the authors mean, but it is unnecessarily confusing to refer to it in this way. One might as well refer to \u201cthe zeroth row\u201d as listing the duration of the clip :) The experimental evaluation: I would like to hear some of the paired samples that were played for subjects. Were classical score excerpts chosen starting at random locations in the score, or at the beginning of the score? It is known that listening to a 10-second excerpt without context can sometimes not make sense. I would be curious to see the false positives versus the false negatives. Nevertheless, I certainly appreciate the authors\u2019 warning to interpret the listening results with caution. Originality & Significance -- So far, based both on the techniques and the output, I am not entirely convinced of the originality or significance of this particular system. The authors refer to \u201crhythmically simple polyphonic scores\u201d such as Bachbot, but I cannot see what is rhythmically fundamentally more sophisticated about the scores being generated by the present system. One nice characteristic of the present system is the true and audible independence of the voices. One of the contributions appears to be the construction of models that explicitly leverage with shared weights some of the patterns that occur in different \u201cplaces\u201d (pitch-wise and temporally) in music. This is both very reasonable, and also not an entirely novel idea; see for example the excellent work by Daniel Johnson, \u201cGenerating Polyphonic Music Using Tied Parallel Networks\u201d (paper published 2017, first shared online, as far as I know, in 2015: links to all materials available at http://www.hexahedria.com/2015/08/03/composing-music-with-recurrent-neural-networks/ ) Another now common (and non exclusive) way to handle some of this is by augmenting the data with transposition. It seems that the authors are not doing this here. Why not? It usually helps. Another contribution appears to be the use of a per-time measure of loss. This is reasonable, and I believe others have done this as well. I certainly appreciated the explicit justification for it, however. Note that the idea of using a vector to indicate metric subdivision was also used in (Johnson 2015). Playing through some of the scores, it is clear that melodies themselves are often quite unusual (check user studies), but the voices do stay closely connected harmonically, which is what gives the system a certain aural coherence. I would be interested to hear (and look at) what is generated in two-part harmony, and even what is generated-- as a sort of baseline-- with just a single part. I encourage the authors to look at and listen to the work by Johnson: -listening samples: http://www.hexahedria.com/2015/08/03/composing-music-with-recurrent-neural-networks/ -associated publication: http://www.hexahedria.com/files/2017generatingpolyphonic.pdf Overall, I think that the problem of generating rhythmically and polyphonically complex music is a good one, the approaches seem to generally be reasonable, although they do not appear to be particularly novel, and the musical results are not particularly impressive. The architectural choices are not always clearly presented.

This paper views the problem as modelling a probability distribution over musical scores that is parametrized using convolutional and recurrent networks. Emphasis is given to careful evaluation, both quantitatively and qualitatively. The technical parts are quite poorly written. The introduction is quite well written and it is easy to follow. It provides a good review that is nicely balanced between older and recent literature. Unfortunately, at the technical parts, the paper starts to suffer due to sloppy notation. The cross entropy definition is missing important details. What does S exactly denote? Are you referring to a binary piano roll or some abstract vector valued process? This leaves a lot of guess work to the reader. Even the footnote makes it evident that the authors may have a different mental picture -- I would argue that a piano roll does not need two bits. Take a binary matrix: Roll(note=n, time=t) = 1 (=0) when note n is present (absent) at time t. I also think the term factorization is sometimes used freely as a synonym for representation in last paragraphs of 4 and first two paragraphs of 5 -- I find this misleading without proper definitions. The models, which are central to the message of the paper, are not described clearly. Please define function a(\\cdot) in (2), (3), (4), : this maybe possibly a typesetting issue (and a is highly likely a sigmoid) but what does x_p W_hp x x_pt etc stand for? Various contractions? You have only defined the tensor as x_tpn. Even there, the proposed encoding is difficult to follow -- using different names for different ranges of the same index (n and d) seems to be avoiding important details and calling for trouble. Why not just introduce an order 4 tensor and represent everything in the product space as every note must have a duration? While the paper includes some interesting ideas about representation of relative pitch, the poor technical writing makes it not suitable to ICLR and hard to judge/interpret the extensive simulation results. Minor: For tensors, 'rank-3' is not correct use, please use order-3 here if you are referring to the number of dimensions of the multiway array. What is a non-linear sampling scheme?

Emphasis is given to careful evaluation, both quantitatively and qualitatively. The technical parts are quite poorly written. The introduction is quite well written and it is easy to follow. It provides a good review that is nicely balanced between older and recent literature. Unfortunately, at the technical parts, the paper starts to suffer due to sloppy notation. The cross entropy definition is missing important details. What does S exactly denote? Are you referring to a binary piano roll or some abstract vector valued process? This leaves a lot of guess work to the reader. Even the footnote makes it evident that the authors may have a different mental picture -- I would argue that a piano roll does not need two bits. Take a binary matrix: Roll(note=n, time=t) = 1 (=0) when note n is present (absent) at time t. I also think the term factorization is sometimes used freely as a synonym for representation in last paragraphs of 4 and first two paragraphs of 5 -- I find this misleading without proper definitions. The models, which are central to the message of the paper, are not described clearly. Please define function a(\\cdot) in (2), (3), (4), : this maybe possibly a typesetting issue (and a is highly likely a sigmoid) but what does x_p W_hp x x_pt etc stand for? Various contractions? You have only defined the tensor as x_tpn. Even there, the proposed encoding is difficult to follow -- using different names for different ranges of the same index (n and d) seems to be avoiding important details and calling for trouble. Why not just introduce an order 4 tensor and represent everything in the product space as every note must have a duration? While the paper includes some interesting ideas about representation of relative pitch, the poor technical writing makes it not suitable to ICLR and hard to judge/interpret the extensive simulation results. Minor: For tensors, 'rank-3' is not correct use, please use order-3 here if you are referring to the number of dimensions of the multiway array. What is a non-linear sampling scheme? Please be more precise. The Allan-Williams citation and year is broken: Moray Allan and Christopher K. I. Williams. Harmonising Chorales by Probabilistic Inference.

We have revised the paper to clarify the notational and definitional issues you identified . Regarding the number of bits needed for a piano roll : we have included further discussion of this point in Appendix B . We draw your attention in particular to Figures 5 and 7 , which clarify the need for a second bit to distinguish between the onset of a note and continuation of a note from an earlier frame ."}}
