The new dataset is the first to account for all of the following fundamental aspect of videos: temporal ordering, short- and long term reasoning, and control for scene biases. Due to the inherent biases in available action recognition datasets, models that simply averages video frames do nearly as well as models that take temporal dependencies into account. In contrast, the authors show that with the proposed dataset, models without spatiotemporal reasoning largely fail. The paper should be accepted as it addresses a major shortcoming of all existing video understanding datasets. It does a good job at summarizing the deficiencies in existing datasets, clearly motivating the need for a new dataset. The claims are backed up with solid experiments, ablating models and data parameters adequately. It is mostly well-written (except for section 4 which would benefit from extensive proofreading) and does a good job at covering relevant work. One drawback is of course the synthetic nature and limited domain of objects and actions. On the other hand, this makes the setup highly controllable and reliable. I like the fact that each task comes both with both static and moving camera. Improvements and Questions: Some relevant datasets are missing. For example, the Moving MNIST and Robot Pushing datasets could be added to Table 1. I suggest having a train / validation / test split (like CLEVR), rather than just a train and validation split.

The dataset is an extension of CLEVR using simple motions of primitive 3D objects to produce videos of primitive actions (e.g. pick and place a cube), compositional actions (e.g. \"cone is rotated during the sliding of the sphere\"), and finally a 3D object localization tasks (i.e. where is the \"snitch\" object at the end of the video). The construction of the dataset focuses on demonstrating that compositional action classification and long-term temporal reasoning for action understanding and localization in videos are largely unsolved problems, and that frame aggregation-based methods on real video data in prior work datasets, have found relative success not because the tasks are easy but because of dataset bias issues. A variety of models from recent work are evaluated on the three proposed tasks, demonstrating the validity of the above motivation for the construction of the dataset. The primitive action classification task is \"solved\" by nearly all methods and only serves for debugging purposes. The compositional action classification task is harder and shows that incorporating LSTMs for temporal reasoning leads to non-trivial performance improvements over frame averaging.

My primary concern is to what extent can the new dataset (CATER) add to existing video datasets that are also explicitly designed for long term spatial-temporal reasoning, such as video VQA datasets TGIF-QA[1]/SVQA[2]. In addition to the comparison between CATER and three action recognition datasets (Kinetics/UCF101/HMDB51) as presented in Table 3., it would be more interesting to see how video understanding models that are specifically designed for those video VQA datasets will perform on CATER.
