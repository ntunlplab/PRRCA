Since the teacher is exploiting the relationship between concepts and examples , the examples look interpretable because they are still grounded to the concepts . For example , for the case with the rectangles , training on random examples in step one allows the student learns that the perimeter of the rectangle must contain all examples given to it . It learns a strategy of guessing approximately the smallest rectangle that will encompass all examples . Because the student expects examples to be within the rectangle , then in step two , the teacher automatically learns to give examples that are within the rectangle , without being constrained to .

We redid the analysis of the boolean concepts human experiment ( the accuracy score ) following the methodology in [ Jaeger , 2008 ] and found the result to still be highly significant ( p < 0.001 ) . Our goal in the bimodal concepts human experiment ( scored with KL divergence ) was to test whether humans given examples from the teacher ( Group 1 ) learn the bimodal distributions better than humans given random examples ( Group 2 ) . We thought a natural way to quantify this would be to calculate for each concept the KL divergence between a subject \u2019 s estimated distribution and the true ground-truth distribution . We then attempted to see if there was a significant difference between the KL divergences in Group 1 and Group 2 using a t-test . We did not see how this translates to a G-test because we want to compare the KL divergences between the two groups , rather than testing whether the human distributions are different from the theoretical , true distribution . As you mentioned , proper statistical tests are crucial to interpret our results . We realized another obstacle to easily interpreting our results is the interpretability of the measure . It is difficult for anyone to interpret what the KL divergence really means in this context . So , we devised a more direct measure that also lent itself to clear statistical analysis . We emphasize that we did not change any of the data in the experiment , we merely reanalyzed it with a less obfuscated measure than KL divergence . In the experiment , subjects were shown five test lines for each concept , two of which had a high probability of being in the concept and three of which had a very low probability of being in the concept . They were asked to rate on a scale from 1 to 5 how likely it was that a line was in the concept . Rather , than calculating KL divergence , we calculate an accuracy score where a success is defined as rating the high-probability lines > 3 and the low-probability lines < = 3 . Using an accuracy measure leads to much more interpretable analysis . Here are the statistics for the teacher and random group : Group 1 ( Teacher exs ) : Mean accuracy : 0.183 , Min accuracy : 0 , Max accuracy : 0.7 , Standard deviation : 0.190 Group 2 ( Random exs ) : Mean accuracy : 0.083 , Min accuracy : 0 , Max accuracy : 0.2 , Standard deviation : 0.058 Using this measure makes it more clear how well people are actually doing . It is a hard task because they are tested on getting the entire distribution correct . And as you can see , neither group does very well . As mentioned in the paper , we believe a reason for the low accuracy is that humans have a different , incorrect prior over the structure of concepts . In particular , it seems like many believed that the concepts were unimodal distributions , rather than bimodal . However , the teacher group is better on average ( 18 % versus 8 % ) , and has much more variance , with the best getting 70 % of the questions right , whereas the best under random examples is only 20 % .
