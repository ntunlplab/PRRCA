The main contribution of our work is extending integrated variance-based approaches to active learning to CNNs . Previously , integrated variance-based approaches have typically been applied to Gaussian processes ( GP ) rather than neural networks . The joint Gaussian assumption can be motivated as approximating the CNN by a GP thereby enabling tractable estimation of the variance of a large , representative sample of points conditioned on an unlabeled data point . Under the assumptions stated in the paper , the proposed acquisition function is the statistically optimal one , in that the queried point minimizes expected MSE conditioned on that point . This is shown in Section 3.1 . The distribution of the unobserved label does not affect the validity of the argument presented in Section 3.1 because the distribution of the unobserved label only affects the second and third terms of the expansion in Eq ( 1 ) , both of which are constant in $ x_ { new } $ . The proposed approach is motivated by the regression setting , for which relatively few active learning algorithms have been proposed for neural networks . The presentation of the classification setting along with empirical results is intended to demonstrate that the method extends to classification , although that is not our main contribution . You are correct in noting that the joint Gaussian assumption in the classification setting is an approximation given that probabilities are bounded . As stated in the paper , we investigated alternative formulations of the proposed approach in classification tasks such that the joint Gaussian assumption is applied to unbounded quantities such as logits . However , our empirical results demonstrated that our method in classification was most effective when applied to probabilities in spite of the apparent limitations of this approximation . We address the approximate nature of the joint Gaussian assumption in classification in the third paragraph of Section 3.4 of the paper . We have observed that our method performs well compared to the baselines for batch sizes of up to several hundred points . The method tends to outperform baselines by a lesser extent for batch sizes greater than several hundred points . However , we believe that the strong performance of the proposed method for batch sizes up to several hundred points is sufficient for it to be useful in a variety of applications . We have found empirically that performance is not very sensitive to the number of points in the representative set . We have run new experiments on MNIST 7 vs. 9 binary classification in order to gauge the sensitivity of the proposed method to the representative sample size . Hypothesis tests based on linear mixed models for batch size 25 found no statistically significant difference in the active learning performance of our method run with representative sample sizes of 500 , 2500 , and 5000 points ( and for all representative sample sizes , our method significantly outperformed random and robust k-Center acquisition ) . These results have been added to the paper ( Figure 3 ( f ) ) ."}, {"review_id": "Uh0T_Q0pg7r-1", "review_text": "The paper considers the active leaning problem by proposing a new acquisition function based on Expected improvement ( EI ) . The paper shows that acquiring the point maximizing the expected reduction in predictive uncertainty across all points is equivalent to maximizing the expected improvement ( EI ) . The paper considers the setting for CNN classification and regression where the authors derive the variance estimations . The paper also extends to the batch mode to select multiple points simultaneously . The uncertainty is estimated using MC dropout . The papers show that the improvement in the experiment is not significant comparing to the baselines . == Major concern : although the paper claims to derive the EI-based acquisition function for active learning . The resulting derivation shows that the final acquisition function only depends on the uncertainty of the training data given the select point ( x_new ) while the relative contribution of the x_new toward the final performance E ( y_train | x_new ) has been vanished .

Regarding our contribution : Our main contribution is not deriving the EI ; as the reviewer observes , EI-based algorithms have been formulated for Bayesian optimization . We view our main contribution as extending integrated variance approaches , which attempt to construct statistically optimal active learning queries , to CNNs . In response to the major concern : We believe that the reviewer may have misunderstood our definition of expected improvement ( see Eq 5 and Eq 6 and the paragraph following each of these two equations ) . The notion of expected improvement used in our paper is different from that used in ( Jones et al 1998 ) and , consequently $ E ( y_ { train } | x_ { new } ) $ does not appear in our objective function . As stated in the paper , we define expected improvement as the reduction in predictive variance across a large , representative sample of points that is expected to result from querying x_ { new } under our assumptions . Section 3.1 of the paper shows that the $ x_ { new } $ maximizing expected improvement ( as we define it ) is the same $ x_ { new } $ that minimizes expected prediction error after it is queried . Since our definition of the expected improvement involves the variance in the prediction of Y rather than the value of Y itself , the expected value of Y does not come into play . In response to concerns that the improvement is not significant compared to the baselines : Multiple experiments presented in the paper show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the baselines by a statistically significant margin . All p-values comparing performance of our active learning method to the baselines in the regression setting are below 0.01 . The proposed algorithm has outperformed random acquisition and maximum variance acquisition by a statistically significant margin in all active learning experiments we have conducted for regression tasks . Additionally Table 2 shows that the proposed approach performs better than all baselines , including state-of-the-art methods such as core-set active learning , in MNIST 7 vs. 9 classification with batch size 1 . Although the proposed approach does not exhibit statistically significant improvement over all baselines in MNIST 0-9 classification for batch size 100 , it is on par with top-performing existing methods . In MNIST 0-9 classification with batch size 25 , the proposed method outperforms random and maximum entropy acquisition ( $ p < 0.01 $ , Figure 3 ( b ) ) . In response to the minor concern : We believe the reviewer may have misunderstood the proposed active learning approach . Our method does , importantly , utilize the full joint covariance of model predictions across the representative sample of points . It is correct that Eq 2 states that the point acquired minimizes the point-wise variance such that it minimizes expected squared prediction error . However , the way in which we choose $ x^ * $ and estimate the right hand side of Eq 2 involves the covariance between model predictions , as is discussed in Sections 3.3 and 3.4 . We believe that acquiring points based on covariance between model predictions is an important advantage of our method . For instance , uncertainty sampling methods typically query uncertain points , but no claim can be made about the resulting improvement in model predictions . On the other hand , our formulation utilizes the joint covariance of model predictions across a large sample of points to query the point that , accounting for correlations between model predictions across points , minimizes expected prediction error upon being queried .

Thank you for the feedback regarding experiments in which the proposed algorithm does not significantly outperform random acquisition .

However , MNIST 0-9 classification with batch size 100 is a task where many active learning methods , including the proposed approach , do not outperform random acquisition significantly .

It is true that greedy batch selection methods often query correlated points , which results in reduced performance . Although our batch-mode active learning algorithm is a greedy algorithm , querying batches of diverse points , via iterative updates to the predictive covariance , is one of its key advantages . The proposed batch-mode active learning algorithm sequentially assembles a batch by adding the point that is expected to maximally reduce predictive variance conditioned on all existing points in the batch . Therefore , we explicitly construct batches such that each new point added to a batch is expected to maximally reduce the predictive uncertainty that remains after querying the existing points in the batch .
