The key idea is to incorporate classifiers that predict the ordering of sub-layers ( self-attention , cross-attention , feed-forward ) from the averaged input sequence representation , one classifier each for the encoder and the decoder . During training the model uses a soft Gumbel-noised output of the classifier to combine the outputs from stacks with differently ordered sub-layers . During inference the argmax of the classifier prediction is used to generate the output sequence . The model is trained with two auxiliary losses : ( i ) A loss to ensure the expected output of the classifiers is uniform and ( ii ) A loss to ensure the classifier output for each individual sample is distant from uniform . Experiments are performed on 8 IWSLT translation tasks , code generation and Gigaword summarization . The proposed approach results in significant gains over a standard transformer on all the reported tasks . Strengths : 1 . Significant gains on a variety of sequence-to-sequence NLP tasks . 2.The authors conduct several experiments trying to uncover the source of the quality gains , comparing against ensembling approaches , layer re-ordering based regularization and layerdrop on the IWSLT En-De task . The approach is also demonstrated to improve the quality of a DynamicConv based Machine Translation model ( although less effective than in the Transformer setting ) . Weaknesses : 1 . While the authors do compare against regularization ( layer re-ordering ) , the settings of these experiments are not very clear and the results are reported only on the IWSLT De- > En task . A more careful comparison on all the reported tasks to counter against the regularization hypothesis would significantly strengthen the claims in the paper . Other questions for authors : 1 . On page 2 in the introduction , the reported average Bleu variance per sample ( 114.76 ) seems way too high , given that Bleu $ \\in [ 0 , 100 ] $ . 2.Do the predictor outputs approach the argmax ? If not , is there a quality loss incurred by choosing the argmax instead of using the expectation like during training ? 3.Did the authors try using a single predictor for both the encoder and decoder ( i.e.a single classifier predicting $ M\\times N $ classes ) ? 4.Are the layer orders preferred by a particular input ( or the subset of input examples that prefer the same layer order ) consistent across randomly initialized training runs ? This analysis might help justify the claim that certain layer orders are better for harder/easier inputs . 5.Other relevant work on instance-level adaptation in NLP : [ 1,2,3 ] Recommendation : I think there are several interesting ideas in the paper , and would recommend ( weak ) acceptance . There is still some doubt as to whether the quality gains are arising from a regularization effect or the instance-based layer re-ordering . I would be willing to update my recommendation given additional evidence to address this concern .

Towards the weaknesses : 1 . Sorry about the unclear part of the experiment settings . We have updated the main text and Appendix in revised version . We describe clearer settings of this paragraph here . ( 1 ) : The first experiment is \u201c ordered Transformer \u201d without instance awareness . That is , all the reordered architectures are trained on the whole same corpus with equal weights , and the parameters for these reordered architectures are shared . More specifically , the decoder block has different ways to order SA , ED , and FF layers ( e.g. , SA- > ED- > FF , FF- > SA- > ED , etc ) , but the parameters for the reordered blocks are shared . Mathematically , the loss function is : $ \\mathcal { L_ { C } } = \\sum_ { n=1 } ^ { N } ( \\lambda_n \\cdot \\mathcal { L_ { M } } ^ { n } ) $ , where $ \\mathcal { L_ { M } } ^ { n } $ is the model loss function for $ n $ -th ordered decoder . Compared with Eqn ( 3 ) , the weight $ \\lambda_n $ is fixed to be $ \\frac { 1 } { N } $ here . At inference , we first find out the best order according to the dev performance and apply it on the test set . We can not use instance-wise reordered model for translation in this setting , while our proposed IOT can . We conduct experiments on iwslt14 De- > En translation with transformer_iwslt_de_en configuration . We find the BLEU score for each decoder is similar and near 34.80 , which is far behind our IOT performance . This demonstrates that simply regularizing the shared parameters for different orders is not the main contribution to performance improvement , and it verifies our instance-wise learning is critical . ( 2 ) The second regularization experiment is to integrate another regularization technique \u201c LayerDrop \u201d [ 1 ] into both the Transformer baseline and our IOT ( N=4 ) method , while other settings remain unchanged . By using LayerDrop , the test BLEU of standard Transformer can be boosted from 34.64 to 35.40 , and that of IOT can be boosted from 35.62 to 36.13 . This demonstrates IOT is orthogonal to the existing regularization techniques and can be smoothly integrated with them . 2.As your suggestion to give a comparison on all reported tasks , we provide all IWSLT translation tasks ( 8 directions translations ) and WMT16 Ro- > En translation here . The results of setting ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) described in response 1 on these tasks are as follows . We can see the improvements are consistent on IWSLT14 De- > En setting . We also provide these results in Appendix B.3 of the revised paper . | | Ende | Deen | Enfr | Fren | Enzh | Zhen | Enes | Esen | RoEn | || -- ||-|-| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | | Transformer | 28.57 | 34.64 | 35.9 | 36.1 | 26.3 | 18.4 | 39.0 | 40.6 | 37.73 | | IOT ( N=4 ) | 29.52 | 35.62 | 37.2 | 37.8 | 27.2 | 19.3 | 40.1 | 41.7 | 38.83 | | Transformer+ ( 1 ) | 28.35 $ \\pm $ 0.12 | 34.68 $ \\pm $ 0.05 | 35.9 $ \\pm $ 0.23 | 36.7 $ \\pm $ 0.14 | 26.4 $ \\pm $ 0.05 | 18.8 $ \\pm $ 0.17 | 37.7 $ \\pm $ 0.28 | 39.6 $ \\pm $ 0.11 | 37.82 $ \\pm $ 0.05 | | Transformer+ ( 2 ) | 29.01 | 35.40 | 36.2 | 36.8 | 26.8 | 19.0 | 39.4 | 40.8 | 38.33 | | IOT ( N=4 ) + ( 2 ) | 29.94 | 36.13 | 37.4 | 38.1 | 27.3 | 19.5 | 40.6 | 42.5 | 38.98 | Towards the questions : 1 . What we report in the paper is the variance instead of standard derivation . Therefore , the value could exceed 100 . We also report the standard derivation here . The average BLEU variance per sample is 114.76 , which is calculated by : $ var_ { avg } = \\frac { 1 } { |D| } \\sum_ { x\\in D } var ( BLEU ( x ) ) $ , and the average BLEU standard derivation per sample is 7.28 , which is calculate by : $ std\\_ { avg } = \\frac { 1 } { |D| } \\sum_ { x\\in D } std ( BLEU ( x ) ) $ . The score is large for each data sample because BLEU is sensitive to the n-gram differences . Take the example on Table 2 , the variance for this example is 1063.18 , and the standard derivation is 32.61 , which is large . ( continue to Part 2 )"}, {"review_id": "ipUPfYxWZvM-1", "review_text": "This paper studies the influence of the arrangement order for the internal structure in a single-layer Transformer ( they named it as layer order ) on the performance . It makes a hypothesis that different layer order has an impact on the performance of the model , and the hypothesis is verified by experiments . Based on this hypothesis , a lightweight layer order predictor is designed to predict an input-related layer order , and through reinforcement learning with two auxiliary loss , the model can not only be trained by diverse layer order , but also make unambiguous layer order prediction as far as possible . The IOT structure proposed in this paper has been evaluated on several datasets of machine translation , abstract summarization and code generation . Compared with the traditional transformer structure , it has been improved consistently , which shows the effectiveness of the proposed structure . My concerns are as the following , 1 . Training time : it seems that this paper only reports the time of inference . However , compared with the standard Transformer , the IOT proposed in this paper only changes the order inside the Transformer layer and it does not increase the additional inference time consumption . In addition , too simple predictor will have little impact over time cost . However , for training , due to the additional loss , additional order exploration , etc. , the convergence time of the model may be changed . Therefore , I expect to see comparison of IOT with Transformer . 2.Internal order : since the mentioned internal structure order of Transformer will affect the results , meanwhile , according to the previous work , the order of LayerNorm may also affect the performance of the model . I am curious if such a structure can be also considered and compared . 3.Model capacity : There is a claim that the capacity of the model has been improved due to the introduction of IOT , while there is no direct evidence from experiments that can support such a claim . Since the parameters of the model have not changed , I feel it hard to regard the improved model capacity . Besides , it is not clear on the definition of the model capacity . 4.Different input and different structures : because this paper claims that different inputs should bring different structures , but according to the current training method with mini-batch for neural networks , it seems that it is impossible to give a completely different structure for each sentence . I expect to see some obvious enough evidence on different structures in sequence-level or batch-level from such training . Minor comments , It would be better if the ablation experiments are done on a larger dataset such as WMT 14 .", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Thanks for your review and comments . For your concerns , we make responses as follows . 1.As for the training time , we have reported some results in Appendix B.1 previously . In the revised version , we add more analysis in Section 5.1 of the main text , please kindly check it again . We have compared the number of epochs for convergence , training time per epoch , and the total training time . The quick conclusion is that , though each training epoch takes more time , our algorithm requires fewer epochs to converge . Therefore , the overall cost does not increase much . For example , IOT ( N=3 ) only takes $ 1.44\\times $ total training time on IWSLT14 En- > De translation compared with Transformer baseline . 2.About LayerNorm order . Previous works [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] have demonstrated the difference between pre-norm and post-norm of LayerNorm . Pre-norm is more suitable to train a very deep model , while for the same number of layers ( e.g. , 6 layers , which are not very deep ) in Transformer , post-norm empirically achieves better accuracy . Since our goal is to improve model accuracy without adding extra parameters , we adopt the post-norm in our IOT . 3.About model capacity . Indeed , it is hard to strictly and mathematically define \u201c model capacity \u201d . We have revised this , as shown in abstract and related parts . What we want to express is that our method has more flexibility to build functions for sequence generation . Take translation as an example . For the standard Transformer , there is only one fixed order of layers ( e.g. , SA- > ED- > FF ) for the translation function ( i.e. , translation model ) . In comparison , our IOT can build variant models with different layer orders , and the order is adaptively determined based on the input instance . Therefore , each sentence has more opportunities to select the optimal one among these functions so as to improve the performance . 4.About the different structures for each sentence during training . Actually , during training , the layer order of each sentence is represented by a distribution ( output by $ \\pi $ ) instead of a deterministic one . Each sentence in a mini-batch has its own distribution of the orders . Therefore , the difference of the structure selection is reflected by the different predicted distribution for each sentence during training . Indeed , we are not \u201c to give a completely different structure for each sentence \u201d during training ( though we never claim this in the paper ) . It is automatically decided by the predicted distribution , and these structures are weighted ( weight is the predicted distribution ) and trained together . To give empirical evidence , we show the predicted distribution values along the training epochs of two training sentence examples from a same mini-batch ( on IWSLT14 De- > En training set ) as follows . We can see that the distributions become more and more concentrated as training goes on , which indicts the different structures selected by different sentences . | Sentence A : Epoch | Order 1 | Order 4 | Order 6 | ||-|-|-| | 1 | 0.31 | 0.38 | 0.31 | | 15 | 0.26 | 0.29 | 0.45 | | 25 | 0.09 | 0.14 | 0.76 | | 35 | 0.02 | 0.02 | * * 0.96 * * | ||-|-|-| | * * Sentence B * * : * * Epoch * * | * * Order 1 * * | * * Order 4 * * | * * Order 6 * * | ||-|-|-| | 1 | 0.42 | 0.32 | 0.26 | | 15 | 0.54 | 0.24 | 0.22 | | 25 | 0.83 | 0.10 | 0.07 | | 35 | * * 0.97 * * | 0.02 | 0.01 | ||-|-|-| 5 . About the ablation study on WMT 14 dataset . First , this is a big dataset , and each training consumes much time . It will cost a lot for ablation studies . Therefore , we conduct ablation studies only on IWSLT14 small dataset . We believe similar results can be observed on WMT14 as well . Second , performing ablation studies on small datasets such as IWSLT14 is widely adopted and accepted in many works , for example , [ 5 , 6 , 7 ] . Third , for the study on numbers of different orders , we have provided results in Table 14 in Appendix A.4 . We will add other ablation studies in later version .

We provide the following responses for the comments and questions . * Yes , to make batch inference and save the inference cost , we have to implement a masking matrix ( supported by ` torch.index_select ( ) ` ) for the batch data and let each ordered decoder to only decode the corresponding data samples . Besides , the masked data are distributed on different CUDA streams ( supported by ` torch.cuda.Stream ( ) ` ) to run concurrently . The time reported in Table 8 is the sum of per sample decoding on the test set . * Thanks for your great question . As shown in Appendix B.3 , the different subsets of sentences indeed have different patterns to favor different layer orders . For example , order $ 1 $ is favored by relative \u201c simple sentences \u201d while order $ 4 $ is favored by \u201c emphatic sentences \u201d . Though we have those shallow observations , unfortunately , we have no deep understanding on the internal relationship between a specific layer order and a certain data pattern . It is hard to analyze such a deep neural network , we will continue working on this . * Yes , this is also an interesting point to show the consistence . We count the proportion as you suggested on an IOT ( N=6 ) model compared with Table 1 , and the corresponding ratio for each decoder is as follows : 0.18518 , 0.12758 , 0.19841 , 0.19415 , 0.14817 , 0.14651 . Overall speaking , we can see it is balanced as in Table 1 . As for the consistent decisions between Table 1 and IOT , assume that we independently train $ N $ models with different layer orders . For each test data $ x $ , we translate $ x $ using the above models , and calculate the corresponding sentence-level BLEU scores . Let $ O ( x , k ) $ denote a $ k $ -element set of layer orders , whose corresponding models can achieve the top- $ k $ highest BLEU score of sentence $ x $ ( $ k\\le N $ ) . Let $ A ( x ) $ denote the layer order determined by our IOT for sequence $ x $ . We calculate the top @ K accuracy ( consistence ) as follows : $ $ \\text { top @ k } = \\frac { \\sum_ { x\\in\\mathcal { X } } I ( A ( x ) \\in O ( x , k ) ) } { \\vert \\mathcal { X } \\vert } , $ $ where $ \\mathcal { X } $ denotes the collection of all test inputs . Note that the top @ 1 accuracy measures the \u201c the best performing order \u201d as you mentioned . We conduct experiments on IWSLT \u2019 14 De- > En . The top-k accuracies are listed in the below table . The results show that in most cases , IOT provide a relatively good order ( at least , top-3 with 84.1 % ) of the Transformer model . Note that as reported in Table 1 of the main text , the variance of sentence BLEU is large . Therefore , it is hard to find the exact top-1 order but we can still achieve 31.3 % accuracy . We further calculate the corpus BLEU that each sentence is decoded by the order with corresponding top/second/third BLEU . The top-1 order BLEU score is 42.48 , and the second , third order BLEU is 38.48 and 35.84 ( close to our IOT BLEU 35.62 ) , much higher than Transformer baseline 34.7 . From these results , we can see that our IOT indeed makes reasonable and good decisions to choose the best/better orders as in Table 1 . |Top- $ k $ |top @ k | | -- |-| | Top-1 | 31.3 % | | Top-2 | 61.6 % | | Top-3 | 84.1 % | We hope the above discussions address your questions ."}, {"review_id": "ipUPfYxWZvM-3", "review_text": "I think the general idea behind this paper is very exciting : architectures mutating in an instance-based way . I was hoping to see that the authors had achieved this whilst adding only a small overhead of parameters and training FLOPs such that we could be sure any gains are n't due to augmenting these two quantities ( i.e.instance-based re-ordering is the key ingredient ) and to be sure this could be applied in the large-model setting and theoretically improve production translation systems . However the proposed architecture is essentially training an ensemble of three , or n_reorder , weight-shared models and then at inference time , using a hard-threshold . The paper really tries to brush over this fact , stating there is negligible additional cost in the abstract and in several other parts of the text . There is only this one line to acknowledge the fact that we are training 3x ( or even 4x ) models : `` One may concern the training cost is increased through our training . As we present in Appendix B.1 , the cost is actually acceptable with a fast convergence . '' and then this section in the appendix continues to mostly discuss inference cost , but finally admits the n_reorder flops increase stating that it is acceptable because the model converges faster . It does n't seem likely the model will converge 3x faster in general , especially if it learns to mostly select only one re-ordering after some training . My general sense is the proposed architecture sits in a very tenuous space . If the researcher has 3-4x space and flops to train a model 3-4x larger , then they should clearly do so . This will get much better performance . If the researcher has 3-4x space to train a larger model but wants faster inference , perhaps this approach could be useful but I would suspect training large and then pruning or distilling to be much more effective . If the architecture trained with hard re-ordering decisions and thus used the same number of flops , but still outperformed the baseline it would be a clear win . Suggestions : * Compare training flops and eval performance to the approach of training a 3x larger model that is then pruned or distilled . * Be up-front about the training wall-clock time in the main text , instead of stating everything has negligible cost and only reporting inference speed . * Consider using RL or another hard-decision approach . * Consider comparing to a model that has the same number of parameters but 3x the compute ( e.g.a transformer with 3x depth but shared weights for each of the three layers ) .", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Thanks for your reviews , comments , and suggestions . We understand your concerns about the training cost . Regarding our writing , we are not trying to brush the training cost fact but instead , we just want to emphasize more on the inference cost . First , the \u201c negligible cost \u201d mainly refers to the inference cost instead of training , and the additional parameter cost . We are sorry not to clearly state these in abstract and related parts , we have revised accordingly . Second , the training cost is indeed increased , as we stated in the paper , but the focus of this paper is to improve the model accuracy without adding additional inference cost . This is a realistic and crucial factor in production translation systems . For most production translation systems in the industry , to provide a quick translation inference service with high quality is much more important than caring about the training cost . From the research aspect , we also concern about the training cost , and therefore we conduct some statistical analysis . We only report in the appendix due to the space limitation of the main text previously , we have put into the main text in revised version . Yes , the convergence speed is not 3x , but the convergence indeed is much faster , and the additional total training cost is not much : for example , IOT ( N=3 ) only costs $ 1.44\\times $ total training time on IWSLT14 En- > De translation compared with Transformer baseline model , as we reported in the revised version in Section 5.1 of main text . Hope these numbers and statistics address your concerns . For your concerns about architecture : 1 . As for the larger model and space , we have to say this is not always true to \u201c get much better performance \u201d with a 3-4x larger model ( at least in seq2seq machine translation , MT ) . For example , [ 1,2,3 ] all report that simply training deeper/larger transformer models ( for MT ) is hard , either no obvious gain or training diverges . Successful training of deep/large Transformer models requires special or complex designs [ 2,4,5 ] , the performances are not much better than ours ( e.g. , 30.1 in [ 5 ] v.s.our IOT 30.03 for WMT14 En- > De translation ) , and the inference speed becomes slower for those methods . 2.Knowledge distillation from a large teacher model can help improve the performance , but it does not bring as much improvement as our method . Besides , it consumes more training cost ( See our response below for your suggestion 1 ) . 3.For the last scenario , RL based learning may achieve a \u201c clear win \u201d result to make a hard-reordered training with similar number of FLOPS , but it needs more trial-and-error , and the result may not be so good , please also refer to our response to your suggestion 3 below . We also conduct experiments according to your suggestions : * For Suggestion 1 : We train 3x larger Transformer models for iwslt14 De- > En translation through deeper and wider models , the performance for 3x deeper model is 33.85 ( worse than Transformer baseline 34.64 ) , while the model of 3x wider is failed to converge , which demonstrates the hardness of training such deep/wide models . As for further distillation , we adopt the sequence-level distillation method described in [ 6 ] to train a 1x student Transformer model ( take 3x deeper model as teacher ) , the performance is 35.21 , which surpasses the teacher model and the Transformer baseline , but it is still worse than IOT ( 35.62 ) and the inference costs much more than our IOT . We also count the training time of 3x deeper model and the distillation training of a 1x Transformer model , to further show the advantages of IOT . The training cost of 3x deep teacher model is 757.3s x 33 epochs = 24990.9s , the 1x student model training costs 516.9s x 30 epochs = 15507.0s , and thus the total cost is 24990.9s + 15507.0s = $ 40497.9s $ . IOT ( N=3 ) costs 699.4s x 35 epochs = $ 24479.0s $ , which is only $ 0.6\\times $ cost compared with training of 3x Transformer and distillation of 1x student . We summarize the statistics in the below table . | Model | BLEU | Training Cost | Total Cost | ||-|-| -- | | 3x deeper ( teacher ) | 33.85 | 757.3s x 33 epochs = 24990.9s | | | 1x distillation ( student ) | 35.21 | 516.9s x 30 epochs = 15507.0s | 24990.9s + 15507.0s = 40497.9s | | IOT ( N=3 ) | 35.62 | 699.4s x 35 epochs = 24479.0s | 24479.0s ( $ 0.6\\times $ ) | * For Suggestion 2 : Thanks for your suggestion ! We have put the detailed number/statistics of the training and inference cost in Section 5.1 in the revised main text . It is much clearer now .

The key idea is to incorporate classifiers that predict the ordering of sub-layers ( self-attention , cross-attention , feed-forward ) from the averaged input sequence representation , one classifier each for the encoder and the decoder . During training the model uses a soft Gumbel-noised output of the classifier to combine the outputs from stacks with differently ordered sub-layers . During inference the argmax of the classifier prediction is used to generate the output sequence . The model is trained with two auxiliary losses : ( i ) A loss to ensure the expected output of the classifiers is uniform and ( ii ) A loss to ensure the classifier output for each individual sample is distant from uniform . Experiments are performed on 8 IWSLT translation tasks , code generation and Gigaword summarization . The proposed approach results in significant gains over a standard transformer on all the reported tasks . Strengths : 1 . Significant gains on a variety of sequence-to-sequence NLP tasks . 2.The authors conduct several experiments trying to uncover the source of the quality gains , comparing against ensembling approaches , layer re-ordering based regularization and layerdrop on the IWSLT En-De task . The approach is also demonstrated to improve the quality of a DynamicConv based Machine Translation model ( although less effective than in the Transformer setting ) . Weaknesses : 1 . While the authors do compare against regularization ( layer re-ordering ) , the settings of these experiments are not very clear and the results are reported only on the IWSLT De- > En task . A more careful comparison on all the reported tasks to counter against the regularization hypothesis would significantly strengthen the claims in the paper . Other questions for authors : 1 . On page 2 in the introduction , the reported average Bleu variance per sample ( 114.76 ) seems way too high , given that Bleu $ \\in [ 0 , 100 ] $ . 2.Do the predictor outputs approach the argmax ? If not , is there a quality loss incurred by choosing the argmax instead of using the expectation like during training ? 3.Did the authors try using a single predictor for both the encoder and decoder ( i.e.a single classifier predicting $ M\\times N $ classes ) ? 4.Are the layer orders preferred by a particular input ( or the subset of input examples that prefer the same layer order ) consistent across randomly initialized training runs ? This analysis might help justify the claim that certain layer orders are better for harder/easier inputs . 5.Other relevant work on instance-level adaptation in NLP : [ 1,2,3 ] Recommendation : I think there are several interesting ideas in the paper , and would recommend ( weak ) acceptance . There is still some doubt as to whether the quality gains are arising from a regularization effect or the instance-based layer re-ordering . I would be willing to update my recommendation given additional evidence to address this concern .

Towards the weaknesses : 1 . Sorry about the unclear part of the experiment settings . We have updated the main text and Appendix in revised version . We describe clearer settings of this paragraph here . ( 1 ) : The first experiment is \u201c ordered Transformer \u201d without instance awareness . That is , all the reordered architectures are trained on the whole same corpus with equal weights , and the parameters for these reordered architectures are shared . More specifically , the decoder block has different ways to order SA , ED , and FF layers ( e.g. , SA- > ED- > FF , FF- > SA- > ED , etc ) , but the parameters for the reordered blocks are shared . Mathematically , the loss function is : $ \\mathcal { L_ { C } } = \\sum_ { n=1 } ^ { N } ( \\lambda_n \\cdot \\mathcal { L_ { M } } ^ { n } ) $ , where $ \\mathcal { L_ { M } } ^ { n } $ is the model loss function for $ n $ -th ordered decoder . Compared with Eqn ( 3 ) , the weight $ \\lambda_n $ is fixed to be $ \\frac { 1 } { N } $ here . At inference , we first find out the best order according to the dev performance and apply it on the test set . We can not use instance-wise reordered model for translation in this setting , while our proposed IOT can . We conduct experiments on iwslt14 De- > En translation with transformer_iwslt_de_en configuration . We find the BLEU score for each decoder is similar and near 34.80 , which is far behind our IOT performance . This demonstrates that simply regularizing the shared parameters for different orders is not the main contribution to performance improvement , and it verifies our instance-wise learning is critical . ( 2 ) The second regularization experiment is to integrate another regularization technique \u201c LayerDrop \u201d [ 1 ] into both the Transformer baseline and our IOT ( N=4 ) method , while other settings remain unchanged . By using LayerDrop , the test BLEU of standard Transformer can be boosted from 34.64 to 35.40 , and that of IOT can be boosted from 35.62 to 36.13 . This demonstrates IOT is orthogonal to the existing regularization techniques and can be smoothly integrated with them . 2.As your suggestion to give a comparison on all reported tasks , we provide all IWSLT translation tasks ( 8 directions translations ) and WMT16 Ro- > En translation here . The results of setting ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) described in response 1 on these tasks are as follows . We can see the improvements are consistent on IWSLT14 De- > En setting . We also provide these results in Appendix B.3 of the revised paper . | | Ende | Deen | Enfr | Fren | Enzh | Zhen | Enes | Esen | RoEn | || -- ||-|-| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | | Transformer | 28.57 | 34.64 | 35.9 | 36.1 | 26.3 | 18.4 | 39.0 | 40.6 | 37.73 | | IOT ( N=4 ) | 29.52 | 35.62 | 37.2 | 37.8 | 27.2 | 19.3 | 40.1 | 41.7 | 38.83 | | Transformer+ ( 1 ) | 28.35 $ \\pm $ 0.12 | 34.68 $ \\pm $ 0.05 | 35.9 $ \\pm $ 0.23 | 36.7 $ \\pm $ 0.14 | 26.4 $ \\pm $ 0.05 | 18.8 $ \\pm $ 0.17 | 37.7 $ \\pm $ 0.28 | 39.6 $ \\pm $ 0.11 | 37.82 $ \\pm $ 0.05 | | Transformer+ ( 2 ) | 29.01 | 35.40 | 36.2 | 36.8 | 26.8 | 19.0 | 39.4 | 40.8 | 38.33 | | IOT ( N=4 ) + ( 2 ) | 29.94 | 36.13 | 37.4 | 38.1 | 27.3 | 19.5 | 40.6 | 42.5 | 38.98 | Towards the questions : 1 . What we report in the paper is the variance instead of standard derivation . Therefore , the value could exceed 100 . We also report the standard derivation here . The average BLEU variance per sample is 114.76 , which is calculated by : $ var_ { avg } = \\frac { 1 } { |D| } \\sum_ { x\\in D } var ( BLEU ( x ) ) $ , and the average BLEU standard derivation per sample is 7.28 , which is calculate by : $ std\\_ { avg } = \\frac { 1 } { |D| } \\sum_ { x\\in D } std ( BLEU ( x ) ) $ . The score is large for each data sample because BLEU is sensitive to the n-gram differences . Take the example on Table 2 , the variance for this example is 1063.18 , and the standard derivation is 32.61 , which is large . ( continue to Part 2 )"}, "1": {"review_id": "ipUPfYxWZvM-1", "review_text": "This paper studies the influence of the arrangement order for the internal structure in a single-layer Transformer ( they named it as layer order ) on the performance . It makes a hypothesis that different layer order has an impact on the performance of the model , and the hypothesis is verified by experiments . Based on this hypothesis , a lightweight layer order predictor is designed to predict an input-related layer order , and through reinforcement learning with two auxiliary loss , the model can not only be trained by diverse layer order , but also make unambiguous layer order prediction as far as possible . The IOT structure proposed in this paper has been evaluated on several datasets of machine translation , abstract summarization and code generation . Compared with the traditional transformer structure , it has been improved consistently , which shows the effectiveness of the proposed structure . My concerns are as the following , 1 . Training time : it seems that this paper only reports the time of inference . However , compared with the standard Transformer , the IOT proposed in this paper only changes the order inside the Transformer layer and it does not increase the additional inference time consumption . In addition , too simple predictor will have little impact over time cost . However , for training , due to the additional loss , additional order exploration , etc. , the convergence time of the model may be changed . Therefore , I expect to see comparison of IOT with Transformer . 2.Internal order : since the mentioned internal structure order of Transformer will affect the results , meanwhile , according to the previous work , the order of LayerNorm may also affect the performance of the model . I am curious if such a structure can be also considered and compared . 3.Model capacity : There is a claim that the capacity of the model has been improved due to the introduction of IOT , while there is no direct evidence from experiments that can support such a claim . Since the parameters of the model have not changed , I feel it hard to regard the improved model capacity . Besides , it is not clear on the definition of the model capacity . 4.Different input and different structures : because this paper claims that different inputs should bring different structures , but according to the current training method with mini-batch for neural networks , it seems that it is impossible to give a completely different structure for each sentence . I expect to see some obvious enough evidence on different structures in sequence-level or batch-level from such training . Minor comments , It would be better if the ablation experiments are done on a larger dataset such as WMT 14 .", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Thanks for your review and comments . For your concerns , we make responses as follows . 1.As for the training time , we have reported some results in Appendix B.1 previously . In the revised version , we add more analysis in Section 5.1 of the main text , please kindly check it again . We have compared the number of epochs for convergence , training time per epoch , and the total training time . The quick conclusion is that , though each training epoch takes more time , our algorithm requires fewer epochs to converge . Therefore , the overall cost does not increase much . For example , IOT ( N=3 ) only takes $ 1.44\\times $ total training time on IWSLT14 En- > De translation compared with Transformer baseline . 2.About LayerNorm order . Previous works [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] have demonstrated the difference between pre-norm and post-norm of LayerNorm . Pre-norm is more suitable to train a very deep model , while for the same number of layers ( e.g. , 6 layers , which are not very deep ) in Transformer , post-norm empirically achieves better accuracy . Since our goal is to improve model accuracy without adding extra parameters , we adopt the post-norm in our IOT . 3.About model capacity . Indeed , it is hard to strictly and mathematically define \u201c model capacity \u201d . We have revised this , as shown in abstract and related parts . What we want to express is that our method has more flexibility to build functions for sequence generation . Take translation as an example . For the standard Transformer , there is only one fixed order of layers ( e.g. , SA- > ED- > FF ) for the translation function ( i.e. , translation model ) . In comparison , our IOT can build variant models with different layer orders , and the order is adaptively determined based on the input instance . Therefore , each sentence has more opportunities to select the optimal one among these functions so as to improve the performance . 4.About the different structures for each sentence during training . Actually , during training , the layer order of each sentence is represented by a distribution ( output by $ \\pi $ ) instead of a deterministic one . Each sentence in a mini-batch has its own distribution of the orders . Therefore , the difference of the structure selection is reflected by the different predicted distribution for each sentence during training . Indeed , we are not \u201c to give a completely different structure for each sentence \u201d during training ( though we never claim this in the paper ) . It is automatically decided by the predicted distribution , and these structures are weighted ( weight is the predicted distribution ) and trained together . To give empirical evidence , we show the predicted distribution values along the training epochs of two training sentence examples from a same mini-batch ( on IWSLT14 De- > En training set ) as follows . We can see that the distributions become more and more concentrated as training goes on , which indicts the different structures selected by different sentences . | Sentence A : Epoch | Order 1 | Order 4 | Order 6 | ||-|-|-| | 1 | 0.31 | 0.38 | 0.31 | | 15 | 0.26 | 0.29 | 0.45 | | 25 | 0.09 | 0.14 | 0.76 | | 35 | 0.02 | 0.02 | * * 0.96 * * | ||-|-|-| | * * Sentence B * * : * * Epoch * * | * * Order 1 * * | * * Order 4 * * | * * Order 6 * * | ||-|-|-| | 1 | 0.42 | 0.32 | 0.26 | | 15 | 0.54 | 0.24 | 0.22 | | 25 | 0.83 | 0.10 | 0.07 | | 35 | * * 0.97 * * | 0.02 | 0.01 | ||-|-|-| 5 . About the ablation study on WMT 14 dataset . First , this is a big dataset , and each training consumes much time . It will cost a lot for ablation studies . Therefore , we conduct ablation studies only on IWSLT14 small dataset . We believe similar results can be observed on WMT14 as well . Second , performing ablation studies on small datasets such as IWSLT14 is widely adopted and accepted in many works , for example , [ 5 , 6 , 7 ] . Third , for the study on numbers of different orders , we have provided results in Table 14 in Appendix A.4 . We will add other ablation studies in later version .

We provide the following responses for the comments and questions . * Yes , to make batch inference and save the inference cost , we have to implement a masking matrix ( supported by ` torch.index_select ( ) ` ) for the batch data and let each ordered decoder to only decode the corresponding data samples . Besides , the masked data are distributed on different CUDA streams ( supported by ` torch.cuda.Stream ( ) ` ) to run concurrently . The time reported in Table 8 is the sum of per sample decoding on the test set . * Thanks for your great question . As shown in Appendix B.3 , the different subsets of sentences indeed have different patterns to favor different layer orders . For example , order $ 1 $ is favored by relative \u201c simple sentences \u201d while order $ 4 $ is favored by \u201c emphatic sentences \u201d . Though we have those shallow observations , unfortunately , we have no deep understanding on the internal relationship between a specific layer order and a certain data pattern . It is hard to analyze such a deep neural network , we will continue working on this . * Yes , this is also an interesting point to show the consistence . We count the proportion as you suggested on an IOT ( N=6 ) model compared with Table 1 , and the corresponding ratio for each decoder is as follows : 0.18518 , 0.12758 , 0.19841 , 0.19415 , 0.14817 , 0.14651 . Overall speaking , we can see it is balanced as in Table 1 . As for the consistent decisions between Table 1 and IOT , assume that we independently train $ N $ models with different layer orders . For each test data $ x $ , we translate $ x $ using the above models , and calculate the corresponding sentence-level BLEU scores . Let $ O ( x , k ) $ denote a $ k $ -element set of layer orders , whose corresponding models can achieve the top- $ k $ highest BLEU score of sentence $ x $ ( $ k\\le N $ ) . Let $ A ( x ) $ denote the layer order determined by our IOT for sequence $ x $ . We calculate the top @ K accuracy ( consistence ) as follows : $ $ \\text { top @ k } = \\frac { \\sum_ { x\\in\\mathcal { X } } I ( A ( x ) \\in O ( x , k ) ) } { \\vert \\mathcal { X } \\vert } , $ $ where $ \\mathcal { X } $ denotes the collection of all test inputs . Note that the top @ 1 accuracy measures the \u201c the best performing order \u201d as you mentioned . We conduct experiments on IWSLT \u2019 14 De- > En . The top-k accuracies are listed in the below table . The results show that in most cases , IOT provide a relatively good order ( at least , top-3 with 84.1 % ) of the Transformer model . Note that as reported in Table 1 of the main text , the variance of sentence BLEU is large . Therefore , it is hard to find the exact top-1 order but we can still achieve 31.3 % accuracy . We further calculate the corpus BLEU that each sentence is decoded by the order with corresponding top/second/third BLEU . The top-1 order BLEU score is 42.48 , and the second , third order BLEU is 38.48 and 35.84 ( close to our IOT BLEU 35.62 ) , much higher than Transformer baseline 34.7 . From these results , we can see that our IOT indeed makes reasonable and good decisions to choose the best/better orders as in Table 1 . |Top- $ k $ |top @ k | | -- |-| | Top-1 | 31.3 % | | Top-2 | 61.6 % | | Top-3 | 84.1 % | We hope the above discussions address your questions ."}, "3": {"review_id": "ipUPfYxWZvM-3", "review_text": "I think the general idea behind this paper is very exciting : architectures mutating in an instance-based way . I was hoping to see that the authors had achieved this whilst adding only a small overhead of parameters and training FLOPs such that we could be sure any gains are n't due to augmenting these two quantities ( i.e.instance-based re-ordering is the key ingredient ) and to be sure this could be applied in the large-model setting and theoretically improve production translation systems . However the proposed architecture is essentially training an ensemble of three , or n_reorder , weight-shared models and then at inference time , using a hard-threshold . The paper really tries to brush over this fact , stating there is negligible additional cost in the abstract and in several other parts of the text . There is only this one line to acknowledge the fact that we are training 3x ( or even 4x ) models : `` One may concern the training cost is increased through our training . As we present in Appendix B.1 , the cost is actually acceptable with a fast convergence . '' and then this section in the appendix continues to mostly discuss inference cost , but finally admits the n_reorder flops increase stating that it is acceptable because the model converges faster . It does n't seem likely the model will converge 3x faster in general , especially if it learns to mostly select only one re-ordering after some training . My general sense is the proposed architecture sits in a very tenuous space . If the researcher has 3-4x space and flops to train a model 3-4x larger , then they should clearly do so . This will get much better performance . If the researcher has 3-4x space to train a larger model but wants faster inference , perhaps this approach could be useful but I would suspect training large and then pruning or distilling to be much more effective . If the architecture trained with hard re-ordering decisions and thus used the same number of flops , but still outperformed the baseline it would be a clear win . Suggestions : * Compare training flops and eval performance to the approach of training a 3x larger model that is then pruned or distilled . * Be up-front about the training wall-clock time in the main text , instead of stating everything has negligible cost and only reporting inference speed . * Consider using RL or another hard-decision approach . * Consider comparing to a model that has the same number of parameters but 3x the compute ( e.g.a transformer with 3x depth but shared weights for each of the three layers ) .", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Thanks for your reviews , comments , and suggestions . We understand your concerns about the training cost . Regarding our writing , we are not trying to brush the training cost fact but instead , we just want to emphasize more on the inference cost . First , the \u201c negligible cost \u201d mainly refers to the inference cost instead of training , and the additional parameter cost . We are sorry not to clearly state these in abstract and related parts , we have revised accordingly . Second , the training cost is indeed increased , as we stated in the paper , but the focus of this paper is to improve the model accuracy without adding additional inference cost . This is a realistic and crucial factor in production translation systems . For most production translation systems in the industry , to provide a quick translation inference service with high quality is much more important than caring about the training cost . From the research aspect , we also concern about the training cost , and therefore we conduct some statistical analysis . We only report in the appendix due to the space limitation of the main text previously , we have put into the main text in revised version . Yes , the convergence speed is not 3x , but the convergence indeed is much faster , and the additional total training cost is not much : for example , IOT ( N=3 ) only costs $ 1.44\\times $ total training time on IWSLT14 En- > De translation compared with Transformer baseline model , as we reported in the revised version in Section 5.1 of main text . Hope these numbers and statistics address your concerns . For your concerns about architecture : 1 . As for the larger model and space , we have to say this is not always true to \u201c get much better performance \u201d with a 3-4x larger model ( at least in seq2seq machine translation , MT ) . For example , [ 1,2,3 ] all report that simply training deeper/larger transformer models ( for MT ) is hard , either no obvious gain or training diverges . Successful training of deep/large Transformer models requires special or complex designs [ 2,4,5 ] , the performances are not much better than ours ( e.g. , 30.1 in [ 5 ] v.s.our IOT 30.03 for WMT14 En- > De translation ) , and the inference speed becomes slower for those methods . 2.Knowledge distillation from a large teacher model can help improve the performance , but it does not bring as much improvement as our method . Besides , it consumes more training cost ( See our response below for your suggestion 1 ) . 3.For the last scenario , RL based learning may achieve a \u201c clear win \u201d result to make a hard-reordered training with similar number of FLOPS , but it needs more trial-and-error , and the result may not be so good , please also refer to our response to your suggestion 3 below . We also conduct experiments according to your suggestions : * For Suggestion 1 : We train 3x larger Transformer models for iwslt14 De- > En translation through deeper and wider models , the performance for 3x deeper model is 33.85 ( worse than Transformer baseline 34.64 ) , while the model of 3x wider is failed to converge , which demonstrates the hardness of training such deep/wide models . As for further distillation , we adopt the sequence-level distillation method described in [ 6 ] to train a 1x student Transformer model ( take 3x deeper model as teacher ) , the performance is 35.21 , which surpasses the teacher model and the Transformer baseline , but it is still worse than IOT ( 35.62 ) and the inference costs much more than our IOT . We also count the training time of 3x deeper model and the distillation training of a 1x Transformer model , to further show the advantages of IOT . The training cost of 3x deep teacher model is 757.3s x 33 epochs = 24990.9s , the 1x student model training costs 516.9s x 30 epochs = 15507.0s , and thus the total cost is 24990.9s + 15507.0s = $ 40497.9s $ . IOT ( N=3 ) costs 699.4s x 35 epochs = $ 24479.0s $ , which is only $ 0.6\\times $ cost compared with training of 3x Transformer and distillation of 1x student . We summarize the statistics in the below table . | Model | BLEU | Training Cost | Total Cost | ||-|-| -- | | 3x deeper ( teacher ) | 33.85 | 757.3s x 33 epochs = 24990.9s | | | 1x distillation ( student ) | 35.21 | 516.9s x 30 epochs = 15507.0s | 24990.9s + 15507.0s = 40497.9s | | IOT ( N=3 ) | 35.62 | 699.4s x 35 epochs = 24479.0s | 24479.0s ( $ 0.6\\times $ ) | * For Suggestion 2 : Thanks for your suggestion ! We have put the detailed number/statistics of the training and inference cost in Section 5.1 in the revised main text . It is much clearer now . ( continue to Part 2 )"}}
