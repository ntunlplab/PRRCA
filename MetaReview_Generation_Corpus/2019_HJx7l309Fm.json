The attention mechanism is learnt by a central critic, and it scales linearly with the number of agents rather than quadratically. There is some novelty in the proposed method, and the authors clearly explain and motivate the approach. However the empirical evaluation feels quite limited and does not show conclusively that the method is superior to the others. Moreover, the simple empirical results don't give any evidence how the attention mechanism is working or whether it is truly the attention that is affecting the results. The reviewers were split on their recommendation and did not come to a consensus. The AC feels that the paper is not quite strong enough and encourages the authors to broaden the work with additional experiments and analysis.", "reviews": [{"review_id": "HJx7l309Fm-0", "review_text": "This paper introduces a new method for multi-agent reinforcement learning. The proposed algorithm -- which uses shared critics at training time but individual policies at test time -- makes use of a specialised attention mechanism. The benefits include better scalability (as the dependency of the inputs is linear in the number of agents, rather than quadratic), and also being more amenable to diverse reward and action structures than the previous work. ---------Quality and clarity--------- The paper is nicely written, and the ideas are developed in a clear fashion, if slightly verbose (the first 3 pages, though informative, might have been condensed a bit to make more room for the new algorithm). The problem is well-motivated and the benefits of the new algorithm are well showcased. One negative point that does stick out is the bibliography, where papers that have been published for years (e.g. the Adam paper) are still referenced as arXiv preprints. ---------Originality and significance---------- Although attentive mechanisms have been around for a while, their use in this specific setting (learning shared critics for multi-agent RL) is, and yields desirable properties. The new algorithm opens the door for training in more complex environments, with a larger number of agents (although the number is still limited in the presented experiments). The main issue I do see with the paper is its experimental section. The two tasks are picked to showcase the benefits of the new approach. This does mean that the competing algorithms have to undergo significant changes (at least in the case of the DDPG-based methods), which takes away from the validity of the comparison. Ideally, there would be at least one other task on which the other algorithms have been trained on by their respective authors. As mentioned right before Section 4, MAAC can be used on continuous action spaces at the price of increased computational cost, so this should be doable. Overall, this is a nicely written paper which introduces an interesting new method for multi-agent RL, with promising initial results. A more thorough experimental section with slightly fairer comparisons would increase its quality significantly.
