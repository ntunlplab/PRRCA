{"year": "2020", "forum": "Sye_OgHFwH", "title": "Unrestricted Adversarial Examples via Semantic Manipulation", "decision": "Accept (Poster)", "meta_review": "In this paper, the authors present adversarial attacks by semantic manipulations, i.e., manipulating specific detectors that result in imperceptible changes in the picture, such as changing texture and color, but without affecting their naturalness. Moreover, these tasks are done on two large scale datasets (ImageNet and MSCOCO) and two visual tasks (classification and captioning). Finally, they also test their adversarial examples against a couple of defense mechanisms and how their transferability. Overall, all reviewers agreed this is an interesting work and well executed, complete with experiments and analyses. I agree with the reviewers in the assessment. I think this is an interesting study that moves us beyond restricted pixel perturbations and overall would be interesting to see what other detectors could be used to generate these type of semantic manipulations. I recommend acceptance of this paper.\n", "reviews": [{"review_id": "Sye_OgHFwH-0", "review_text": "The paper proposes cAdv and sAdv, two new unrestricted adversarial attack methods that manipulates either color or texture of an image. To these end, the paper employes another parametrized colorization techniques (and texture transfer method) and proposes optimization objectives for finding adversarial examples with respect to each semantic technique. Experimental results show that the proposed methods are more robust on existing defense methods and more transferrable accross models. The paper also performs a user study to show that the generated examples are fairly imperceptible like the C&W attack. In overall, I agree that seeking a new way of attack is important, and the methods are clearly presented to claim a new message to the community: adversarial examples can be even found by exploiting semantic features that humans also utilize, since DNNs tend to overly-utilize them, e.g. colors. These claims are supported by the experiments showing that the generated examples are more transferrable across robust classifiers. Personally, I liked the idea of using another colorization method to design cAdv and the use of K-means clustering to control the imperceptibility. - Some readers may wonder how the \"averaged-case\" corruption robustness behave for both cAdv and sAdv, e.g. considering random colorization. Would it be worse than the robustness on Gaussian noise? - One of my concerns on tAdv is whether the texture added is indeed effective to reduce the accuracy, or its just from the (yet small) beta term in the objective. Adding an ablation of beta=0 case in the result would much help the understanding of the method. - Eq 1: I think F should denote the classifier to attack, but the description tells it's the colorization network.

Q1 : Some readers may wonder how the `` averaged-case '' corruption robustness behaves for both cAdv and sAdv , e.g.considering random colorization . Would it be worse than the robustness of Gaussian noise ? A1 : Thanks for the interesting question and it \u2019 s indeed reasonable to wonder if the classifier is robust against random colorization with the same level of corruption . As we know , classifiers are robust against small random corruptions , whereas large random corruptions might be able to change the classification results but not certainly . Furthermore , large/unbounded random corruptions , such as random colorization as mentioned , can not generate semantically aligned images . Therefore , they can be easily spotted by humans as adversarial/abnormal . Our methods are exactly trying to resolve these problems by hiding unbounded adversarial patterns in plain sight . In particular , some classifiers are not robust towards large random colorizations as seen from the hue and saturation attack [ 3 ] . Given sufficiently large perturbation , it is not surprising to see the labels changing . However , hue and saturation attacks give unrealistic images and are not able to do targeted attacks ( 1.2 % on ImageNet ) . cAdv , on the other hand , has high attack success rates for both targeted and untargeted attacks while staying perceptually realistic .

We conducted additional experiments suggested as below . We did an ablation with tAdv varying both beta-term and alpha-term in Table 4 of our Appendix . From our study , it can be inferred that increasing beta does not result in an increase in attack success rate ; with a very small beta , the attack is highly successful . However , we did include a row when beta is zero in the submitted version . Here we include the numbers when beta = 0 for two cases when tadv is optimized using LBFGS for one iteration of 14 steps ( small texture flow ) and 3 iterations of 14 steps ( large texture flow ) as described in our paper . Note that making beta = 0 does not guarantee that we will be able to reach the target as it is difficult to control texture transfer and stop when the target is reached as small change in texture can make images classify to arbitrary classes . It is also to be noted that beta=0 would be a black box attack as the attack does not have any knowledge about the target classifier .
