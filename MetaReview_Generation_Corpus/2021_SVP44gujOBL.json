Q1 : How are speedups measured and how to verify the 40 % number ? A1 : The speedup is measured as the improvement over the vanilla model ( we have made this clear in the last paragraph of Section 2 of the revised draft ) . It is computed using the training step value at which CL achieves the same final test accuracy as the vanilla model . For example , if the vanilla model converges to 90 % test accuracy in 100 steps , and the CL model achieves 90 % test accuracy at training step 50 , then the speedup for the CL is 2x . This helps in understanding how good the CL performs when compared to the vanilla model when a target test accuracy is to be achieved . We calculate the speedups attained by CL in each of our experiments and report them along with the mean speedup .

The experiment results show that the proposed curriculum learning strategies can speed up the convergence by a large margin and the authors provide some insights about why curriculum learning works . Strengths : 1 . The proposed `` dynamic curriculum algorithm '' can speed up the convergence by ~45 % and the proposed task-specific curriculum strategy based on standard deviation and entropy can yield an average speedup of ~43 % . 2.The code and data are shared and helpful for reproducing the experiments conducted in the paper . Weaknesses : 1 . The paper is poorly written . There are even no sections to discuss related works and experimental settings in the main paper . Although some related works are discussed scatteredly in the paper , it might be helpful to have a specific section to compare related works with the proposed methods , which makes it much easier to identify the contributions and novelty of this work . Besides , although I found the experimental settings in the supplementary , the main paper at least should have discussed the basic experimental setup to understand how the experiments are conducted . 2.The proposed DCL algorithm requires an optimal weight or a local optimal weight to calculate the difficulty scores . This requirement is unreasonable and renders the proposed methods useless . 3.The proposed scoring function ( the equation at the end of page 3 ) requires to compute the gradients on each sample . Perform back-propagation and computing gradient are highly prohibitive . The learning curves against the time cost should also be reported , in complement to the learning curves against the training steps in Fig.1 . 4.The pace function is just a constant , dependent on a tunable hyperparameter k. From Fig.2 , it seems that the value of k has a large impact on the testing accuracy . It is not mentioned in the paper how the value of k is selected . Suggestions for improvement : 1 . It might be better to have a specific section to discuss related works and compare them with the proposed method . 2.Index all equations . Questions : The questions to be addressed in the rebuttal are listed below : 1 . Where does the optimal weight in DCL comes from ? Can the authors justify why a given optimal weight can be used during the training ? 2.What is the time cost of the scoring function ? 3.How is the value of k in the pace function tuned ? -Post-rebuttal- Thank you for revising the submission and the clarification in the rebuttal . After reading the rebuttal and other reviews , my main concerns about the novelty and computation cost are still unsolved . Therefore , I will keep my original score .", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "reply_text": "Thank you for your comments and suggestions for improvement . A1 : We will clarify this point . The DCL algorithm does not really need an optimal set of weights . As mentioned briefly ( in the second last paragraph of page 4 in the revised draft ) , we can run the DCL algorithm in the following manner -- for a given initialization of weight ( $ w_0 $ ) , the weight that vanilla SGD converges to ( $ \\tilde { w } $ ) is taken as an approximation for global minima ( $ \\bar { w } $ ) . Our empirical analysis shows that DCL finds an ordering of the data points that leads to faster convergence of the model from $ w_0 $ to $ \\tilde { w } $ . Empirical results show that , in fact , DCL reaches a better solution than $ \\tilde { w } $ . A2 : As the reviewer rightly points out , DCL is computationally very expensive as it requires to compute gradients for the entire dataset to find an ordering . Our intention is to use DCL as a framework to support our following arguments and not as a practical CL algorithm : a ) Ordering of mini-batches within an epoch matter ( shown using the comparative performance of DCL+ and DCL- in Figure 2 of the revised draft ) , and b ) CL serves as a regularizer that helps in improving the generalization of the model by avoiding \u201c very hard \u201d examples for training ( shown by varying k ) . DCL+ shows that a curriculum can be defined with gradient information . The practical scoring functions that we suggest -- stddev+/- , entropy+/- etc . can be computed efficiently using standard libraries . A3 : We do not know what fraction of the dataset is \u201c noisy \u201d while training . Hence , the hyperparameter k in DCL is tuned by trial and error . The experiments we perform by varying the value of k help in understanding how CL serves as a regularizer . However , we can compare the performance of DCL+ with varying k values by running them for one training epoch . In our experiments , we find that the k value that performs the best ( decided by looking at the slope of the learning curve ) for one epoch is a good choice for a full training of DCL+ ."}, {"review_id": "SVP44gujOBL-2", "review_text": "Summary : This work studies a number of curriculums for faster training of neural networks . They first propose a curriculum named DCL+ that is designed to order data points based on their alignment of gradient with the direction of optimization . This curriculum depends on the evaluation of individual gradients of datapoints as well as an approximation to a local optima . Next , they study a number of easy-to-compute statistical measures for ordering data points . Pros : - The idea of ordering points based on using alignment of their gradients with the direction to the local optima is interesting . - The idea of using easy-to-compute statistical measures of data is also interesting . Cons : - The empirical setup needs improvement . Important baselines are missing as described below . Standard datasets are not used and the ones used are relatively easy . The combination of these makes it hard to make any conclusions . - The ideas are not formalized well enough . Specifically , important details in the definition of optimal weights in DCL is missing . Also , it is not clear why standard deviation of an image or its entropy could be a proxy for how useful a data point is for training . Detailed notes : Intro : - The discussion about SGD and the generalization of other optimization methods is missing recent works such as [ 1 ] . - It is said that \u201c ... SGD samples examples from data uniformly at random. \u201d This is an inexact description of common training setups . We can use SGD with any stochastic estimate of gradients as long as it is unbiased . It doesn \u2019 t have to be from uniformly sampling a subset . See for example [ 2 ] . - Related works on example reweighting and ordering are missing . For example [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , and [ 5 ] . Section 3 : - Eq 1 : 1 ) theta is not defined , 2 ) why isn \u2019 t the first equality an inequality ? - Figure 3 : 1 ) what is theta ? 2 ) Why is R3 marked as the distance between w3 and w0 ? Shouldn \u2019 t it be the distance between w3 and bar { w } ? - \u201c We approximate w \u0304 with w \u0303 , which is a local minima obtained from training the vanilla SGD model \u201d , isn \u2019 t the goal of the entire training to find w^bar ? How many steps do you train for to get w~ ? - \u201c score ( x ) \u201d change of notation , score was defined as a function of both x and y in Section 2 . - \u201c We use learning rates with an exponential decay rate for the optimizers \u201d what is an exponential decay rate ? How do you tune ? Tune both base and the exponent ? Why is it fair ? There are numerous other learning rate schedules that are more common like the step-decay . - Figure 2 : what is the dataset ? What is the task ? Why is a data point noisy if it has a low score ? Does this figure mean the hyperparameters are tuned on the test set rather than a validation set ? - Experiment 1 is mnist with labels 0 and 1 . As noted in the text this task is very easy . Both DCL- and DCL+ eventually seem to classify the test set correctly . - Experiment 2 is small-mammals dataset . No citation is given . It is said to be a super-class of CIFAR-100 . No comparison is done with optimization methods other than SGD . No references are given for prior baselines on this dataset . No reason is given for not trying out the proposed method on common benchmarks such as full MNIST , CIFAR-10 , and CIFAR-100 . - Figure 1 : the placement of this figure is before Figures 2 , 3 and algorithm 1 but it is referred to after them . The caption is not descriptive enough as it refers to experiments 1 and 2 that doesn \u2019 t make it easy to understand the figure without going back and forth between the figure and the text . Section 5 : - There is no empirical comparison with prior works . - There is no empirical comparison between the DCL method proposed in prior sections . - Figure 6 : same problem in captions as Figure 1 . Other : - I could not uncompress the supplementary material . It needed PK compatibility V4.6 which does not come in the standard zip package .

Unfortunately , the following issues are still unresolved to me : - Figure 1 : this geometrical argument seems to be at the core of Eq.1 but I still have a hard time understanding it .

We have added all the related work that has been pointed out . We have corrected the statement about SGD to say that it proceeds by making unbiased estimates of the gradient on the full data . Q1 : Unclarity in equation 1 . A1 : We have corrected the inconsistencies between Figure 1 ( in the revised draft ) and the definitions in the text for equation 1 . In Figure 1 , $ \\theta $ is the angle between ( $ \\bar { w } - w_3 $ ) and $ a_0 $ , this is a local definition and not related to the $ \\theta_ { i } ^ { \\tilde { t } } $ defined outside . $ \\theta_ { i } ^ { \\tilde { t } } $ is the angle between $ \\nabla f_i ( w_t ) $ and $ a_\\tilde { t } $ . Q2 : How many steps do we train for to obtain $ \\tilde { w } $ ? A2 : We train the vanilla model once until convergence ( in terms of training accuracy ) to obtain $ \\tilde { w } $ , given $ w_0 $ ( we make this clear in Section 3 of the revised draft ) . The actual number of steps varies according to different datasets and architectures . $ \\bar { w } $ is a global optima and it is not clear we can reach that efficiently . We have clarifed the writeup to reflect this . Q3 : Learning rates for the optimizer A3 : We use an exponential step-decay as the learning rate scheduler . We tune both the exponential decay factor and the steps after which the learning rate is decayed . Q4 : Regarding Figure 3 ( in the revised draft ) , \u201c noisy \u201d data , and tuning k A4 : Figure 3 shows the performance of DCL+ with the same setup as experiment 2 ( as mentioned in the caption ) using different k values . In DCL framework , an example is \u201c easy \u201d if its $ \\rho $ value is low . That is , an \u201c easy \u201d example has its gradient aligned towards the minima more than a \u201c hard \u201d example \u2019 s gradient . DCL considers examples with high $ \\rho $ values as \u201c noisy \u201d since they misguide gradient descent away from the minima . The hyperparameter k in DCL is tuned by trial and error on the test set . The experiments we perform by varying the value of k help in understanding how CL serves as a regularizer . Q5 : Dataset for DCL A5 : As rightly pointed out by the reviewers , the DCL algorithm is computationally very expensive . So , experimenting with larger datasets such as full MNIST and CIFAR would be laborious . Moreover , our intention is to use DCL as a framework to support our following arguments and not as a practical CL algorithm : a ) Ordering of mini-batches within an epoch matter ( comparing DCL+ and DCL- ) . b ) CL serves as a regularizer that helps in improving the generalization of the model by avoiding \u201c very hard \u201d examples for training . DCL+ shows that a curriculum can be defined with gradient information . Hence , we only analyze the working of DCL on a hard dataset ( small-mammals ) and an easy dataset ( MNIST with labels 0 and 1 ) ."}, {"review_id": "SVP44gujOBL-3", "review_text": "# # # # Summary - This paper considers curriculum learning for neural networks in the context of supervised learning ( specifically image classification ) . - First , the authors propose and assess a DCL+ algorithm . DCL+ uses a scoring function based on the alignment of an example 's gradient with the vector from the current weight to a local minimum weight ( obtained via a previous `` vanilla '' run with standard SGD ) . The pacing function is a constant fraction of the dataset size . The effect is that for a given epoch , only the subset of data that induces gradients which most point towards the local minimum is used for training . DCL+ is empirically shown to result in marginal improvement over the vanilla run in terms of test performance at convergence , and a significant speedup to reach vanilla performance . To investigate the effect of minibatch ordering within an epoch , the authors propose DCL- , an ablation that reverses the DCL+ minibatch ordering . Since DCL- performs worse than DCL+ , the authors argue that minibatch ordering matters . - Second , the authors propose and assess a few curricula based on scoring functions that only use per-example statistics , e.g.standard deviation ( stddev ) or entropy of pixel values . Interestingly , it seems that for CNNs on CIFAR tasks , using stddev- ( descending order of standard deviation ) as the scoring function is best , while for MLPs on MNIST tasks , using stddev+ ( ascending order of standard deviation ) is best . - The authors connect their DCL+ algorithm to Bengio et al . ( 2009 ) , which argues that a successful strategy for CL methods is to remove `` noisy '' examples . They also provide scatterplots of the data under DCL+ and stddev scoring functions . # # # # Strengths - The algorithmic innovations considered are simple . - The comparison between DCL+ and DCL- shows that minibatch ordering can matter in CL . - If one is willing to treat the unsupervised curriculum as a tunable hyperparameter ( e.g.sweep over stddev+ , stddev- , and vanilla ) , then the experiments suggest that we obtain some gain in test performance . A caveat is that this only is supported for the few relatively toy image classification datasets and architectures considered in the paper . # # # # Weaknesses - For a purely empirical paper , I would not say that the experiments are very comprehensive . For example , a clear discrepancy exists between Exps . 3-5 and Exps . 6-7 ( in the former , stddev- is best , while in the latter , stddev+ is best , and most of the time the opposite curriculum is worse than vanilla ) . No attempt is made to discuss this or tease out the underlying reason : is it the dataset ( CIFAR vs. MNIST ) or the model ( CNN vs MLP ) , or something else ? - Conceptually , the curricula defined by image statistics have a critical weakness : they are completely agnostic to the label . This is in contrast with both DCL+/- and Bengio et al . ( 2009 ) , which both consider `` example noise '' grounded in the full supervised task . The same image ( and therefore statistics ) with different labels ( say , correct vs. incorrect ) would play drastically different roles in a curriculum . - The connection between the notion of a `` noisy example '' as considered by Bengio et al . ( 2009 ) ( misclassified by a Bayes classifier ) and that of DCL+ ( the example 's gradient has strong anti-alignment with the direction to the local optimum ) is not made technically clear or explicit . - Regarding Figs . 1 , 5 , and 6 : I appreciate that the authors included a measure of uncertainty based on 25 or 30 trials , but I would strongly suggest adding significance tests for a more compelling analysis . This is sorely needed for , e.g. , Experiment 4 . - Fig.7 : The caption and the text imply that you 'd provide correlations , but this is missing . Also , I do n't see significant correlations for the bottom row . # # # # Recommendation - I currently recommend rejection ( 4 ) . While the ideas are simple and interesting , the weaknesses in this submission preclude it from being very informative or useful to the community . # # # # Questions - Why does this work not consider comparisons with prior CL methods other than the vanilla baseline ? If none are applicable , please explain why . - Can you unify the notion of a `` noisy '' example as considered by Bengio et al . ( 2009 ) and by DCL+ ? - Fig.1 : Why does subplot ( a ) only show a truncated x-axis ? # # # # Minor suggestions - p. 2 : What is `` theoretical evidence '' ? Do you mean that there is a lack of theory , or a lack of empirical evidence , or both ? - p. 2 : Attribute the concepts of scoring and pacing functions to Hacohen and Weinshall ( 2019 ) . - In general , the clarity of the writing ( e.g.sentence style , diction ) can be improved by a few careful passes . -Post-rebuttal comments- Thank you for taking the time to revise your submission . I will maintain my original score of 4 . The main justification for this is that the two main weaknesses I see in this paper ( the first two I list in the original review ) remain unresolved , and it indeed is unclear whether the second one could feasibly be addressed without significant changes to the core methodology currently proposed .", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "Thank you for your comments and suggestions for improvement .

Strengths : 1 . The proposed `` dynamic curriculum algorithm '' can speed up the convergence by ~45 % and the proposed task-specific curriculum strategy based on standard deviation and entropy can yield an average speedup of ~43 % . 2.The code and data are shared and helpful for reproducing the experiments conducted in the paper . Weaknesses : 1 . The paper is poorly written . There are even no sections to discuss related works and experimental settings in the main paper . Although some related works are discussed scatteredly in the paper , it might be helpful to have a specific section to compare related works with the proposed methods , which makes it much easier to identify the contributions and novelty of this work . Besides , although I found the experimental settings in the supplementary , the main paper at least should have discussed the basic experimental setup to understand how the experiments are conducted . 2.The proposed DCL algorithm requires an optimal weight or a local optimal weight to calculate the difficulty scores . This requirement is unreasonable and renders the proposed methods useless . 3.The proposed scoring function ( the equation at the end of page 3 ) requires to compute the gradients on each sample . Perform back-propagation and computing gradient are highly prohibitive . The learning curves against the time cost should also be reported , in complement to the learning curves against the training steps in Fig.1 . 4.The pace function is just a constant , dependent on a tunable hyperparameter k. From Fig.2 , it seems that the value of k has a large impact on the testing accuracy . It is not mentioned in the paper how the value of k is selected . Suggestions for improvement : 1 . It might be better to have a specific section to discuss related works and compare them with the proposed method . 2.Index all equations . Questions : The questions to be addressed in the rebuttal are listed below : 1 . Where does the optimal weight in DCL comes from ? Can the authors justify why a given optimal weight can be used during the training ? 2.What is the time cost of the scoring function ? 3.How is the value of k in the pace function tuned ? -Post-rebuttal- Thank you for revising the submission and the clarification in the rebuttal . After reading the rebuttal and other reviews , my main concerns about the novelty and computation cost are still unsolved . Therefore , I will keep my original score .", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "reply_text": "Thank you for your comments and suggestions for improvement . A1 : We will clarify this point . The DCL algorithm does not really need an optimal set of weights . As mentioned briefly ( in the second last paragraph of page 4 in the revised draft ) , we can run the DCL algorithm in the following manner -- for a given initialization of weight ( $ w_0 $ ) , the weight that vanilla SGD converges to ( $ \\tilde { w } $ ) is taken as an approximation for global minima ( $ \\bar { w } $ ) . Our empirical analysis shows that DCL finds an ordering of the data points that leads to faster convergence of the model from $ w_0 $ to $ \\tilde { w } $ . Empirical results show that , in fact , DCL reaches a better solution than $ \\tilde { w } $ . A2 : As the reviewer rightly points out , DCL is computationally very expensive as it requires to compute gradients for the entire dataset to find an ordering . Our intention is to use DCL as a framework to support our following arguments and not as a practical CL algorithm : a ) Ordering of mini-batches within an epoch matter ( shown using the comparative performance of DCL+ and DCL- in Figure 2 of the revised draft ) , and b ) CL serves as a regularizer that helps in improving the generalization of the model by avoiding \u201c very hard \u201d examples for training ( shown by varying k ) . DCL+ shows that a curriculum can be defined with gradient information . The practical scoring functions that we suggest -- stddev+/- , entropy+/- etc . can be computed efficiently using standard libraries . A3 : We do not know what fraction of the dataset is \u201c noisy \u201d while training . Hence , the hyperparameter k in DCL is tuned by trial and error . The experiments we perform by varying the value of k help in understanding how CL serves as a regularizer . However , we can compare the performance of DCL+ with varying k values by running them for one training epoch . In our experiments , we find that the k value that performs the best ( decided by looking at the slope of the learning curve ) for one epoch is a good choice for a full training of DCL+ ."}, "2": {"review_id": "SVP44gujOBL-2", "review_text": "Summary : This work studies a number of curriculums for faster training of neural networks . They first propose a curriculum named DCL+ that is designed to order data points based on their alignment of gradient with the direction of optimization . This curriculum depends on the evaluation of individual gradients of datapoints as well as an approximation to a local optima . Next , they study a number of easy-to-compute statistical measures for ordering data points . Pros : - The idea of ordering points based on using alignment of their gradients with the direction to the local optima is interesting . - The idea of using easy-to-compute statistical measures of data is also interesting . Cons : - The empirical setup needs improvement . Important baselines are missing as described below . Standard datasets are not used and the ones used are relatively easy . The combination of these makes it hard to make any conclusions . - The ideas are not formalized well enough . Specifically , important details in the definition of optimal weights in DCL is missing . Also , it is not clear why standard deviation of an image or its entropy could be a proxy for how useful a data point is for training . Detailed notes : Intro : - The discussion about SGD and the generalization of other optimization methods is missing recent works such as [ 1 ] . - It is said that \u201c ... SGD samples examples from data uniformly at random. \u201d This is an inexact description of common training setups . We can use SGD with any stochastic estimate of gradients as long as it is unbiased . It doesn \u2019 t have to be from uniformly sampling a subset . See for example [ 2 ] . - Related works on example reweighting and ordering are missing . For example [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , and [ 5 ] . Section 3 : - Eq 1 : 1 ) theta is not defined , 2 ) why isn \u2019 t the first equality an inequality ? - Figure 3 : 1 ) what is theta ? 2 ) Why is R3 marked as the distance between w3 and w0 ? Shouldn \u2019 t it be the distance between w3 and bar { w } ? - \u201c We approximate w \u0304 with w \u0303 , which is a local minima obtained from training the vanilla SGD model \u201d , isn \u2019 t the goal of the entire training to find w^bar ? How many steps do you train for to get w~ ? - \u201c score ( x ) \u201d change of notation , score was defined as a function of both x and y in Section 2 . - \u201c We use learning rates with an exponential decay rate for the optimizers \u201d what is an exponential decay rate ? How do you tune ? Tune both base and the exponent ? Why is it fair ? There are numerous other learning rate schedules that are more common like the step-decay . - Figure 2 : what is the dataset ? What is the task ? Why is a data point noisy if it has a low score ? Does this figure mean the hyperparameters are tuned on the test set rather than a validation set ? - Experiment 1 is mnist with labels 0 and 1 . As noted in the text this task is very easy . Both DCL- and DCL+ eventually seem to classify the test set correctly . - Experiment 2 is small-mammals dataset . No citation is given . It is said to be a super-class of CIFAR-100 . No comparison is done with optimization methods other than SGD . No references are given for prior baselines on this dataset . No reason is given for not trying out the proposed method on common benchmarks such as full MNIST , CIFAR-10 , and CIFAR-100 . - Figure 1 : the placement of this figure is before Figures 2 , 3 and algorithm 1 but it is referred to after them . The caption is not descriptive enough as it refers to experiments 1 and 2 that doesn \u2019 t make it easy to understand the figure without going back and forth between the figure and the text . Section 5 : - There is no empirical comparison with prior works . - There is no empirical comparison between the DCL method proposed in prior sections . - Figure 6 : same problem in captions as Figure 1 . Other : - I could not uncompress the supplementary material . It needed PK compatibility V4.6 which does not come in the standard zip package .

Unfortunately , the following issues are still unresolved to me : - Figure 1 : this geometrical argument seems to be at the core of Eq.1 but I still have a hard time understanding it . You might want to formalize the argument in text . - Experiments are not convincing . Even the original MNIST is not a representative dataset for optimization methods . The theoretical contributions of this work is not enough to justify having limited experiments . - The rebuttal says : `` The hyperparameter k in DCL is tuned by trial and error on the test set . `` .

We have added all the related work that has been pointed out . We have corrected the statement about SGD to say that it proceeds by making unbiased estimates of the gradient on the full data . Q1 : Unclarity in equation 1 . A1 : We have corrected the inconsistencies between Figure 1 ( in the revised draft ) and the definitions in the text for equation 1 . In Figure 1 , $ \\theta $ is the angle between ( $ \\bar { w } - w_3 $ ) and $ a_0 $ , this is a local definition and not related to the $ \\theta_ { i } ^ { \\tilde { t } } $ defined outside . $ \\theta_ { i } ^ { \\tilde { t } } $ is the angle between $ \\nabla f_i ( w_t ) $ and $ a_\\tilde { t } $ . Q2 : How many steps do we train for to obtain $ \\tilde { w } $ ? A2 : We train the vanilla model once until convergence ( in terms of training accuracy ) to obtain $ \\tilde { w } $ , given $ w_0 $ ( we make this clear in Section 3 of the revised draft ) . The actual number of steps varies according to different datasets and architectures . $ \\bar { w } $ is a global optima and it is not clear we can reach that efficiently . We have clarifed the writeup to reflect this . Q3 : Learning rates for the optimizer A3 : We use an exponential step-decay as the learning rate scheduler . We tune both the exponential decay factor and the steps after which the learning rate is decayed . Q4 : Regarding Figure 3 ( in the revised draft ) , \u201c noisy \u201d data , and tuning k A4 : Figure 3 shows the performance of DCL+ with the same setup as experiment 2 ( as mentioned in the caption ) using different k values . In DCL framework , an example is \u201c easy \u201d if its $ \\rho $ value is low . That is , an \u201c easy \u201d example has its gradient aligned towards the minima more than a \u201c hard \u201d example \u2019 s gradient . DCL considers examples with high $ \\rho $ values as \u201c noisy \u201d since they misguide gradient descent away from the minima . The hyperparameter k in DCL is tuned by trial and error on the test set . The experiments we perform by varying the value of k help in understanding how CL serves as a regularizer . Q5 : Dataset for DCL A5 : As rightly pointed out by the reviewers , the DCL algorithm is computationally very expensive . So , experimenting with larger datasets such as full MNIST and CIFAR would be laborious . Moreover , our intention is to use DCL as a framework to support our following arguments and not as a practical CL algorithm : a ) Ordering of mini-batches within an epoch matter ( comparing DCL+ and DCL- ) . b ) CL serves as a regularizer that helps in improving the generalization of the model by avoiding \u201c very hard \u201d examples for training . DCL+ shows that a curriculum can be defined with gradient information . Hence , we only analyze the working of DCL on a hard dataset ( small-mammals ) and an easy dataset ( MNIST with labels 0 and 1 ) ."}, "3": {"review_id": "SVP44gujOBL-3", "review_text": "# # # # Summary - This paper considers curriculum learning for neural networks in the context of supervised learning ( specifically image classification ) . - First , the authors propose and assess a DCL+ algorithm . DCL+ uses a scoring function based on the alignment of an example 's gradient with the vector from the current weight to a local minimum weight ( obtained via a previous `` vanilla '' run with standard SGD ) . The pacing function is a constant fraction of the dataset size . The effect is that for a given epoch , only the subset of data that induces gradients which most point towards the local minimum is used for training . DCL+ is empirically shown to result in marginal improvement over the vanilla run in terms of test performance at convergence , and a significant speedup to reach vanilla performance . To investigate the effect of minibatch ordering within an epoch , the authors propose DCL- , an ablation that reverses the DCL+ minibatch ordering . Since DCL- performs worse than DCL+ , the authors argue that minibatch ordering matters . - Second , the authors propose and assess a few curricula based on scoring functions that only use per-example statistics , e.g.standard deviation ( stddev ) or entropy of pixel values . Interestingly , it seems that for CNNs on CIFAR tasks , using stddev- ( descending order of standard deviation ) as the scoring function is best , while for MLPs on MNIST tasks , using stddev+ ( ascending order of standard deviation ) is best . - The authors connect their DCL+ algorithm to Bengio et al . ( 2009 ) , which argues that a successful strategy for CL methods is to remove `` noisy '' examples . They also provide scatterplots of the data under DCL+ and stddev scoring functions . # # # # Strengths - The algorithmic innovations considered are simple . - The comparison between DCL+ and DCL- shows that minibatch ordering can matter in CL . - If one is willing to treat the unsupervised curriculum as a tunable hyperparameter ( e.g.sweep over stddev+ , stddev- , and vanilla ) , then the experiments suggest that we obtain some gain in test performance . A caveat is that this only is supported for the few relatively toy image classification datasets and architectures considered in the paper . # # # # Weaknesses - For a purely empirical paper , I would not say that the experiments are very comprehensive . For example , a clear discrepancy exists between Exps . 3-5 and Exps . 6-7 ( in the former , stddev- is best , while in the latter , stddev+ is best , and most of the time the opposite curriculum is worse than vanilla ) . No attempt is made to discuss this or tease out the underlying reason : is it the dataset ( CIFAR vs. MNIST ) or the model ( CNN vs MLP ) , or something else ? - Conceptually , the curricula defined by image statistics have a critical weakness : they are completely agnostic to the label . This is in contrast with both DCL+/- and Bengio et al . ( 2009 ) , which both consider `` example noise '' grounded in the full supervised task . The same image ( and therefore statistics ) with different labels ( say , correct vs. incorrect ) would play drastically different roles in a curriculum . - The connection between the notion of a `` noisy example '' as considered by Bengio et al . ( 2009 ) ( misclassified by a Bayes classifier ) and that of DCL+ ( the example 's gradient has strong anti-alignment with the direction to the local optimum ) is not made technically clear or explicit . - Regarding Figs . 1 , 5 , and 6 : I appreciate that the authors included a measure of uncertainty based on 25 or 30 trials , but I would strongly suggest adding significance tests for a more compelling analysis . This is sorely needed for , e.g. , Experiment 4 . - Fig.7 : The caption and the text imply that you 'd provide correlations , but this is missing . Also , I do n't see significant correlations for the bottom row . # # # # Recommendation - I currently recommend rejection ( 4 ) . While the ideas are simple and interesting , the weaknesses in this submission preclude it from being very informative or useful to the community . # # # # Questions - Why does this work not consider comparisons with prior CL methods other than the vanilla baseline ? If none are applicable , please explain why . - Can you unify the notion of a `` noisy '' example as considered by Bengio et al . ( 2009 ) and by DCL+ ? - Fig.1 : Why does subplot ( a ) only show a truncated x-axis ? # # # # Minor suggestions - p. 2 : What is `` theoretical evidence '' ? Do you mean that there is a lack of theory , or a lack of empirical evidence , or both ? - p. 2 : Attribute the concepts of scoring and pacing functions to Hacohen and Weinshall ( 2019 ) . - In general , the clarity of the writing ( e.g.sentence style , diction ) can be improved by a few careful passes . -Post-rebuttal comments- Thank you for taking the time to revise your submission . I will maintain my original score of 4 . The main justification for this is that the two main weaknesses I see in this paper ( the first two I list in the original review ) remain unresolved , and it indeed is unclear whether the second one could feasibly be addressed without significant changes to the core methodology currently proposed .", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "Thank you for your comments and suggestions for improvement . In Figure 7 , the term \u201c correlation \u201d is misleading , we intend to say that the plots show the relation between the rank according to the stddev and the $ \\rho_ { i , t } $ values . We agree that the relationship between the two quantities in the bottom row ( small mammals dataset ) seems much weaker than the top one ( we have added more text regarding Figure 7 on Page 9 , first paragraph in the revised draft ) . A1 : We have compared two of our experiments to Hacohen & Weinshall ( 2019 ) as a baseline in Figure 6 a , b . A2 : Bengio et al . ( 2009 ) introduced the notion of \u201c noisy example \u201d for CL in their work . In our work , we intend to define \u201c noisy examples \u201d differently based on their gradient values , as the reviewer rightly understands . It is not clear to us whether these notions can be unified . A3 : DCL- shows a much worse test loss in the initial phases of training . Hence , we truncate that part in order to clearly show the improvement of DCL+ over vanilla towards convergence ."}}
