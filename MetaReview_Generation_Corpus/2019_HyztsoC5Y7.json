This paper proposes two model-based meta-learning reinforcement algorithms, one based on MAML and the other based on recurrence, and experimentally shows how they are more sample efficient and faster at adapting to test scenarios than prior approaches, including prior model-free meta-learning approaches. I do have an issue with the way this paper labels prior work as model-free meta-learning algorithms, since for example, MAML is a general algorithm that can be applied to model-free and model-based algorithms alike. It would be more accurate in my opinion to label the contributions of this paper as model-based instantiations of prior existing algorithms, rather than new algorithms outright. I\u2019m a bit confused with equation 3, as the expectation is over a single environment, and the trajectory of data is also sampled from a single environment. But in the writing, the paper describes the setting as a potentially different environment at every timestep. Equation 3 seems to assume that the subsequence of data comes from a single environment, which contradicts what you say in the text. As described, equation 3 is then not really much different from previous episodic or task based formulations. The results themselves are not unexpected, as there has already been prior work that this paper also mentions showing that model-based RL algorithms are more sample efficient than model-free. Section 6.1, I like this comparison and showing how the errors are getting better. For section 6.2, judging from the plots, it doesn\u2019t seem you are doing any meta-learning in this experiment, so then are you just basically running a model-based RL algorithm? I\u2019m very confused what you are trying to show. Are you trying to show the benefit of model-based vs model-free? Prior work has already done that. Are you trying to show that even just using a meta-learning algorithm in an online setting results in good online performance? Then you should be comparing your algorithm to just a model-based online RL algorithm. You also mention that the asymptotic performance falls behind, is this because your model capacity is low, or maybe your MPC method is insufficient? If so, then wouldn\u2019t it be more compelling to, like prior work, combine this with a model-free algorithm and get the best of both worlds? Section 6.3 results look good. Section 6.4, I really like the fact you have results on a real robot. Overall I think the paper does successfully show the sample complexity benefits and fast adaptation of model-based meta-RL methods. The inclusion of a real world robot experiment is a plus. However the result is not particularly surprising or insightful, as prior work has already shown the massive sample complexity improvement of model-based RL methods. UPDATE (Dec 4, 2018): I have read the author response and they have addressed the specific concerns I have brought up. I am overall positive about this paper and the new changes and additions so I will slightly increase my score, though I am still concerned about the significance of the results themselves.

Our intent is not to claim that model-based RL is more sample-efficient than model-free RL ( which , as the reviewer stated , is well known ) , but rather to show that meta-training for fast adaptation can improve over directly running online model updates with a model trained with standard model-based RL . Note that the comparison to `` MB-DE '' in Section 6.3 is precisely this comparison : adapting our meta-trained models outperforms adapting these standard model-based RL models by a large margin . The takeaway of this work is fast adaptation of expressive dynamics models . For instance , a real robot adapting online ( in milliseconds ) to unseen and drastic dynamics changes has not been shown in prior work that we know of . We emphasize that our meta-trained model can adapt in less than a second , whereas model-based RL from scratch takes minutes or hours . Relation to MAML/prior work : We have edited section 2 of the paper to clarify the relation to MAML . In summary : MAML assumes access to a hand-designed distribution of tasks . Instead , one of our primary contributions is the online formulation of meta-learning , where tasks correspond to temporal segments , enabling \u201c tasks \u201d to be constructed automatically from the experience in the environment ; MAML is a very general algorithm , but it has not been previously demonstrated on online learning problems . Equation 3 : We have fixed the discrepancy and added several clarifications in Section 4 . Our method uses M consecutives steps to predict the next K steps , which makes the assumption that the environment is constant for M+K timesteps . As a result , only a fraction of the roll-out , i.e.M+K timesteps , has to correspond to the same environment . The underlying assumption is that the subsequence of data does indeed come from the same environment . In our experiments , M+K is 0.5 seconds , making this assumption true most of the time . The fast adaptation ( F.A . ) environments in Section 6.3 show this adaptation occurring as the environment keeps changing within the rollouts . Section 6.2 : We fixed the typo that was originally in the caption : GrBAL and ReBAL are our proposed meta-learning algorithms , so there is indeed meta-learning in this experiment . In this plot , we aim to show that our model-based meta-learning approaches achieve high performance while using 1000x less data than the two model-free approaches .

The main novelty of the proposed approach is that it defines an effective algorithm that can easily and quickly adapt to the changing context/environments. It borrows the ideas from model-free RL (MAML) to define the gradient/recursive updates of their approach, and it incorporates it efficiently into their model-based RL framework. The paper is well written and the experimental results on synthetic and real world data show that the algorithm can quickly adapt its policy and achieve good results in the tasks, when compared to related approaches. While applying the gradient based adaptation to the model-free RL is trivial and has previously been proposed, in this work the authors do so by also focusing on the \"local\" context (M steps within a K-long horizon, allowing the method to recover quickly if learning from contaminated data, and/or its global policy cannot generalize well to the local contexts. Although this extension is trivial it seems that it has not been applied and measured in terms of the adaptation \"speed\" in previous works. Theoretically, I see more value in their second approach where they investigate the application of fast parameter updates within model-based RL, showing that it does improve over the MAML-RL and non-adaptive model-based RL approaches. This is expected but to my knowledge has not been investigated to this extent before. What I find is lacking in this paper is insight into how sensitive the algorithm is in terms of the K/M ratio, and also how it affects the adaptation speed vs performance (tables 3-5 show an analysis but those are for different tasks); no theoretical analysis was performed to provide deeper understanding of it. The model does solve a practical problem (reducing the learning time and having more robust model), however, it would add more value to the current state of the art in RL if the authors proposed a method for optimal selection of the recovery points and also window ratio R/L depending on the target task. This would make a significant theoretical contribution and the method could be easily applicable to a variety of tasks. where the gains in the adaptation speed are important.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "reply_text": "We thank the reviewer for their valuable feedback and agree that the strength of our approach comes from being able to adapt the dynamics model to the local dynamics .

We also clarify that we do not choose `` M steps within a K-long horizon . '' We have edited section 4 to paper to properly specify it .

We also added a discussion in Appendix D of how the values can be determined -- the optimal values depend on various task details , such as the amount of information present in the state ( a fully-informed state variable precludes the need for additional past timesteps ) and the duration of a single timestep ( a longer timestep duration makes it harder to predict more steps into the future ) .

Learning globally accurate dynamics model is impossible if we consider that environments are dynamic and we can't observe every possible environment state at initial training time. Thus learning dynamics models that can be adapted online fast, to deal with unexpected und never seen before events is an important research problem. This paper proposes to use meta-learning to train an update policy that can update the dynamics model at test time in a sample efficient manner. Two methods are proposed - GrBAL: this method uses MAML for meta-learning - ReBAL: this method trains a recurrent network during meta-training such that it can update the dynamics effectively at test time when the dynamics change Both methods are evaluated on several simulation environments, which show that GrBAL outperforms ReBAL (on average). GrBAL is then evaluated on a real system. The strengths of this paper are: - this work addresses an important problem and is well motivated - experiments on both simulated and on a real system are performed The weaknesses: - the related work section is biased towards the ML community. There is a ton of work on adapting (inverse) dynamics models in the robotics community. This line of work is almost entirely ignored in this paper. Furthermore some important recent references for model-based RL are not provided in the related work section (PETS [3] and MPPI [2]), although MPPI is the controller that is used in this work as a framework for model-based RL. Additionally, existing work on model-based RL with meta-learning [1] has not been cited. This is unacceptable. - There is no significant technical contribution - the \"contribution\" is that existing meta-learning methods have been applied to the model-based RL setting. Even if no-one has had that idea before - it would be a minor contribution, but given that there is prior work on meta-learning in the context of model-based RL, this idea itself is not novel anymore. - Two methods are provided, without much analysis. Often authors refer to \"our approach\" - but it's actually not clear what they mean by our approach. The authors can't claim \"model-based meta RL\" as their approach. - While I commend the authors for performing both simulation and real-world experiments, I find the that experiments lack a principled evaluation. More details below. Feedback on experiments: Section 6.2 (sample efficiency) You compare apples to oranges here. I have no idea whether your improvements in terms of sample-efficiency are due to using a model-based RL approach or because your deploying meta-learning. It is well known that model-based RL is more sample efficient, but often cannot achieve the same asymptotic performance as model-free RL. Since MPPI is your choice of model-based RL framework, you would have to include an evaluation that shows results on MPPI with model bootstrapping (as presented in [2]) to give us an idea of how much more sample-efficient your approach is. Section 6.3 (fast adaptation and generalization) While in theory one can choose the meta-learning approach independently from the choice of model-based controller, in practice the choice of the MPC method is very important. MPPI can handle model inaccuracies very well - almost to the point where sometimes adaptation is not necessary. You CANNOT evaluate MPPI with online adaptation to another MPC approach with another model-learning approach. This does not give me any information of how your meta-learning improves model-adaptation. In essence these comparisons are meaningless. To make your results more meaningful you need to use the same controller setup (let's say MPPI) and then compare the following: 1. MPPI with your meta-trained online adaptation 2. MPPI results with a fixed learned dynamics model - this shows us whether online adaptation helps 3. results of MPPI with the initial dynamics model (trained in the meta-training phase) -without online adaptation. This will tell us whether the meta-training phase provides a dynamics model that generalizes better (even without online adaptation) 4. MPPI with model bootstrapping (as presented in [2]). This will show whether your meta-trained online adaptation actually outperforms simple online model bootstrapping in terms of sample-efficiency The key here is that you need to use the same model-based control setup (whether its MPPI or some other method). Otherwise you cannot detangle the effect of controller choice from your meta-learned online adaptation. 6.4 Real-world: same comments as above, comparisons are not meaningful [1] Meta Reinforcement Learning with Latent Variable Gaussian Processes, UAI 2018 [2] MPPI with model-bootstrapping: Information Theoretic MPC for Model-Based Reinforcement Learning , ICRA 2017 [3] Deep Reinforcement Learning in a Handful of Trials using Probabilistic Dynamics Models, NIPS 2018", "rating": "2: Strong rejection", "reply_text": "We thank the reviewer for the feedback . The main concern of the reviewer is that we did not control for the choice of controller . This is a misunderstanding . We implemented the same controller for all of the model-based comparisons ; hence , all comparisons reported in the paper are fair . To be precise , we used MPPI for all simulation experiments , and random-shooting MPC for all real-world experiments ( since the action spaces were of lower dimension and did not need iterations of refinement ) . We updated the paper to clarify this . Related work : We thank the reviewer for pointing out these recent works . We updated the paper to incorporate citations for model-based RL , adapting inverse dynamic models , and the suggested recent model-based RL citation . Sample efficiency : In this section , we do both of the things the reviewer mentions : we compare our MB meta-learning method against a state-of-the-art MF meta-learning method to show the benefit of model-based over model-free , and against a state-of-the-art MF method to show the benefit of meta-learning . Evaluation : The reviewer suggested 4 points to evaluate . Points ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are exactly the results we show in Section 6.3 : ( 1 ) corresponds to our full GrBAL/ReBAL , meta-learning with adaptation , and ( 2 ) corresponds to our MB baseline , which has neither meta-learning nor adaptation .

Point ( 3 ) suggests metalearning the prior with the adaptation objective , but then not adapting it at test-time . We ran this experiment on the real robot , and it performed worse than ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , failing to solve the task . This is expected ; the meta-learned model parameters ( theta * ) were optimized to be used only after adapting them . We can add these numerical results to our results . The difference between the requested point ( 4 ) and our existing point ( 2 ) is the collection of expert data for initializing the training data set . Being able to collect expert samples is a strong assumption , requiring either human demonstrations or knowledge of the ground truth model , and does not fall under the assumptions of our problem setting . Contribution : Our contribution is a new model-based meta-RL algorithm that incorporates elements of meta-learning and model-based RL . While our method is relatively simple , we are not aware of prior works that show that meta-learning can be used to enable online adaptation to varying dynamics in the context of model-based RL . Further , our experiments , which include domains that are more complex than the cartpole and double pendulum in [ 1 ] , demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach . If we are mistaken regarding prior works , please let us know ! We would like to emphasize that our work presents an extensive comparative evaluation , and we believe that these results should be taken into consideration in evaluating our work . We compare multiple approaches across more than 6 simulated tasks as well as 4 tasks on a real-world robotic locomotion task . Hopefully our clarifications are convincing in terms of explaining why the evaluation is fair and rigorous , and we would of course be happy to modify it as needed ."}], "0": {"review_id": "HyztsoC5Y7-0", "review_text": "The paper proposes using meta-learning and fast, online adaptation of models to overcome the mismatch between simulation and the real world, as well as unexpected changes and dynamics.

Being able to collect expert samples is a strong assumption , requiring either human demonstrations or knowledge of the ground truth model , and does not fall under the assumptions of our problem setting . Contribution : Our contribution is a new model-based meta-RL algorithm that incorporates elements of meta-learning and model-based RL . While our method is relatively simple , we are not aware of prior works that show that meta-learning can be used to enable online adaptation to varying dynamics in the context of model-based RL . Further , our experiments , which include domains that are more complex than the cartpole and double pendulum in [ 1 ] , demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach . If we are mistaken regarding prior works , please let us know ! We would like to emphasize that our work presents an extensive comparative evaluation , and we believe that these results should be taken into consideration in evaluating our work . We compare multiple approaches across more than 6 simulated tasks as well as 4 tasks on a real-world robotic locomotion task . Hopefully our clarifications are convincing in terms of explaining why the evaluation is fair and rigorous , and we would of course be happy to modify it as needed ."}}
