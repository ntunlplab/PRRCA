", "reviews": [{"review_id": "Hygp1nR9FQ-0", "review_text": "The paper proposes the use of bilateral filtering as a defense to adversarial examples (AE). Bilateral Filtering (BF) is a smoothening technique that averages pixels that are close to each other both in position and value. As a result BF preserves sharp edges and the denoised images appear to be of higher quality than those produces via simple Gaussian smoothing. First, the method is evaluated on black-box attacks by constructing AE for the undefended network and then applying the defense. The method is then tested on white-box attacks which attack the defended system end-to-end with first order methods. Finally, the authors propose combining their defense with adversarial training. Overall, I find the main idea of the paper interesting. BF seems like a natural approach to remove low-magnitude perturbations from the image while preserving the salient characteristics of the image. Thus, if it did not hurt classification accuracy significantly it might be considered as part of a cheap preprocessing pipeline that protects the model from simple attacks. However, as shown in Table 3 and 6, BF reduces the accuracy of the original model by at least 5% on ImageNet and CIFAR10. My main objection about the paper is that BF is proposed as a defense that is extremely robust against even the best attacks. However, the evaluation is clearly incomplete for such a claim and fails to pass simple sanity checks. *Epsilon values used to claim robustness are way too high*. Table 4 reports an L_infinity bound of 0.793 (almost 40% the image range) and L_2 of 187 (again roughly a quarter of the L2 radius of the image domain). One can change the class of the image completely (even for humans) with a smaller epsilon bound. This is a very clear indication that the attacks used are not sufficient to properly evaluate the robustness of the defense. Even in the images produced by the authors (Figure 2) it is clear that these perturbations are sufficient in terms of magnitude to completely distort the image. *Only first-order attacks are considered*. From the point about epsilon values above, it is fairly clear that the defense is not easy to attack with first-order methods. This is understandable since BF, even if \"fully differentiable\", will lead to vanishing gradients for certain pixels. I think it is necessary that the authors to evaluate their defense on other attacks such as a) a straight-through approximation of BF (see BPDA from https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00420), b) a finite-differences-based attack (see SPSA from https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05666). As a sanity check, I would even recommend evaluating using the nearest neighbor of each image from a wrong class. It is clear that this attack will always succeed and the L_p distance will be smaller than those reported here. I believe that these are fundamental issues about the paper that need to be addressed before even considering the paper for acceptance and I thus recommend rejection at this time. Other comments and concerns: --Table 6: what is the performance of BFNet without adversarial training? This is a necessary baseline to understand the results of the table. -- I am confused by the adaptation of adversarial training to BFNet (last equation of section 3.4). The equations themselves are confusing since x is used twice (as a parameter to f and sampled from D). My first guess would be that the method is performing end-to-end adversarial training from the loss to the input x (before BF). It appears however that adversarial training is performed with respect to the image *after* applying the BF filter. If this is the case, it goes against the fundamental principles of adversarial training. -- I do not see the point of adaptive filtering (AF) as a defense. BF is attractive because it is simple. Adding a classifier to figure out the right parameters seems dubious at best. The idea seems fundamentally flawed given that the classifier is only trained on known attacks and might thus not capture new, different attacks. Lastly, since the classifier is a ML model, it will clearly be susceptible to adversarial perturbations. So the adversary can choose an attack that fools the original model and forces the classifier to choose bad BF parameters. I would suggest that the authors completely remove AF from future versions of their paper. -- The performance on ImageNet is significantly better than the performance on MNIST and CIFAR10. This is counter-intuitive since a much harder dataset both from a standard and adversarial point of view. Minor comments to authors: -- A JPEG compression-based defense can be bypassed (https://machine-learning-and-security.github.io/papers/mlsec17_paper_54.pdf). -- Last paragraph of page 3 is too informal (\"less holes for adversarials to maneuver on\"). -- Top of page 4: you seem to confuse \"iterative methods\" with \"small magnitude\" attacks. One can use iterative attacks to create large adversarial perturbations (e.g. PGD). -- I would suggest normalizing to the more common [0, 1] range as the current numbers can be confusing. -- I am confused by Tables 2, 3. First row of Table 2 shows that on 95% of the clean inputs the label is not changed after BF. But table 3 shows that the accuracy drop from 78.8% to 71.7%. What is going on here? -- Last part of first paragraph of 4.2 is hard to understand. -- End of page 8, \"the higher dimensionality of CIFAR10 makes it harder than MNIST\".

We have made revisions to our manuscript , and we will answer outstanding questions here . Question : Epsilon values from Table 4 are way too high and the paper should consider finite-difference based attacks such as SPSA and other black box attacks . Answer : We appreciate the point brought forward by the BPDA paper , that gradient masking is often the cause of a defense that looks good on the outside yet is easily broken , and we agree with the reviewer that those experiments are needed . To this end , we performed two black box tests on the non-adversarially trained ImageNet models InceptionResNet-V2 and Inception-V3 ( corresponding to Table 4 ) . We report the results in the updated appendix of the paper . For both attacks , we used the implementation given in the Foolbox toolbox . The results are found in table 7 . First , we used the Boundary attack from [ 1 ] : a decision-based attack that begins with a large adversarial perturbation , then reduces the magnitude of the perturbation while retaining an adversarial label . This attack has been shown to be effective and scale to high dimensional inputs . Second , we used an approximate L-BFGS attack where the gradients are computed numerically . Using a numerical gradient avoids the instabilities in iterative attacks which occur in gradient-masking defenses . From the results given , we can see the BFNet does well against both the decision-based attack and the approximate L-BFGS , showing that it is indeed resistant to such kind of attacks as well . Question : How is adversarial training adapted to BFNet ( Sec.3.4 ) ? Is it applied to the image after applying the bilateral filter ? Answer : Adversarial training is performed on the entire BFNet , including the bilateral filtering layer , which means the gradient goes through the bilateral filter and goes to the original image before the bilateral filtering layer . We have cleared the notations in the paper . Question : Adaptive filtering is a weak defense and should be removed We used adaptive filtering as a motivation to BFNet -- showing that a plain BF with parameter selection can defeat many adversarial examples , but insufficient because it reduces accuracy and can be brittle . It is indeed less capable than the manual filtering , or BFNet . We are open to explicitly mention that or removing this part from the paper if there is a consensus that it \u2019 s not needed . Question : In Table 6 , what is the performance of BFNet without adversarial training ? - Without adversarial training , we can only fine-tune the parameters of the vanilla network to adapt to the bilateral filter . - At first , the accuracy is quite poor . But with fine tuning with 10 epochs , BFNet with both classifiers ( InceptionResNet-V2 and Inception-V3 ) lose only 5 % accuracy on the ImageNet test set . We will include this metric in the final paper . Question : Why are ImageNet results significantly better than MNIST and CIFAR ? We believe the answer to this question is that bilateral filtering is a much more sound approach in high-resolution images such as ImageNet than low-resolution ones such as MNIST and CIFAR . In the 32x32 resolution in MNIST and CIFAR , a bilateral filter can only be very narrow to perform well , otherwise , it would easily distort the image significantly to kill the signal on the original class . On the other hand , with the high resolution in ImageNet , we can perform a significant amount of bilateral filtering ( in terms of both the width and range ) without destroying the content of the image , hence the defense effect would be significantly higher than in low-resolution images .

Also in Table 2, the case (B) measures the ability of the adaptive filtering to change the predicted label from the adversarial label to a 'new' one. In this case, it is important to measure/verify whether the 'new' label is benign or malignant (which may well depend on the specific task of classification and the semantic associations of the output classes).
