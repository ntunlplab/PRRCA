The experiments are broad and detailed. On the negative side, the empirical results recapitulate what would be expected and what has already been seen in the literature, as the authors themselves point out (\"We note that our observation is consistent with the results of regular network training presented in (Shallue et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019).\"). And the theory presented, while it does explain the results nicely, is a trivial reformulation of the standard convergence result given in Equation 2. So while this is an interesting paper and the reviewers rated it positively on average, the sparsity exploration is _much_ more novel than the data-parallelism exploration, and there are significant novelty weaknesses that need to be taken into consideration.", "reviews": [{"review_id": "rsogjAnYs4z-0", "review_text": "After reviewing the authors ' response : The authors have agreed to include missing sparsity level-results and have commented that such results are in line with the trends observed in other experiments . Furthermore , the authors ' response addressed all my questions and concerns , for which I 'm raising my score . = The authors explore the role of data parallelism ( i.e. , the optimal mini-batch size ) and sparsity ( via parameter pruning ) in deep networks through extensive empirical experiments . This effectively builds on the work of Shallue et al . ( 2019 ) , by considering sparsity in addition to the previously explored behavior of data parallelism . Assuming Lipschitz continuity and boundedness on the squared norm of the gradient , the authors then draw theoretical results exposing the role of data parallelism towards convergence for non-convex objectives ( note this thus , of course , means local-optima convergence ) for SGD with a fixed learning rate ( the result for decaying learning rates is included in the appendix ) . The main theoretical result is nice , and Lipschitz continuity in DNNs has been extensively studied recently . In particular , it brings a theoretical understanding to optimizing the batch size , which has generally been understood in empirical/heuristic terms . However , the paper makes certain leaps in logic and claims with regards to sparsity based on the provided evidence . Specifically , in Figure 1 sparsity levels are missing from CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST , and Section 3.2 and Appendix D.2 only consider sparsity \\in { 0.0 , 0.9 } . What happens at sparsity levels between 0 and 90 % ? The paper makes many claims about the behavior of sparsity based experiments largely considering only these two sparsity levels , but there is not enough evidence to make general statements of the behavior of hyperparameters as a function of sparsity when only considering these two extremes . Also , important experimental details and definitions are omitted from the paper which are necessary to fully understand these results and the soundness of the conclusions drawn from them . Specifically : -What is the budget used for the experiments in Figure 3 ? The budget is actually a hyperparameter of this experiment , and thus it would be important to see whether the linear boundary between complete/incomplete exists when the budget is either increased or decreased , i.e. , does this trend generalize for other budgets ? -The definition of `` infeasible '' in Figure 3 is unclear . How can a trial diverge ? It seems like , given a budget , a trial would simply remain incomplete if the budget expired and it had not reached the goal . -How were the plots in Figure 2 were generated , i.e. , were they first normalized then averaged across datasets ? Were sparsity results for 50 % and 70 % included for both Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 ( one and both , respectively , were missing for these in Figure 1 ) ? -There seem to be implicit assumptions in Section 4.1 , specifically , that $ f $ is bounded . For instance , if $ f_ { \\inf } $ goes to either positive or negative infinity , Equation 2 does not say anything helpful . Furthermore , for non-finite $ f $ , the expected average squared norm of the gradient could grow at a rate faster than linear K , which would invalidate the claim in the paper : `` the expected average squared norm of ... during the first K iterations , indicates the degree of convergence ; for example , it gets smaller as training proceeds with increasing K. '' It is important to be clear and precise for these theoretical results . Other comments : -The term `` maximal data parallelism , '' which describes the minibatch size which minimizes the number of steps to convergece , seems mislabeled . should n't this be minimal data parallelism ? The smallest minibatch size should be the most parallelizable disregarding device-to-host communication latency . -While it is ok to forward reference much of the experimental details to the Shallue paper , please at least list the deep learning package and hardware used to run the experiments in the paper . - '' This aligns well with the classic result in learning theory that large batch training allows using bigger learning rates '' < - please include citation for this claim -Note that ( bounds on ) Lipschitz constants in DNNs may estimated via : Fazlyab , Mahyar , et al . `` Efficient and accurate estimation of lipschitz constants for deep neural networks .

We address the comments as below , however , if there remain any concerns , please let us know . We will make our best efforts to address them further . * * Sparsity levels * * We omitted some sparsity results , only because 0 % and 90 % contrast the differences introduced by sparsity most clearly , whereas moderate sparsity levels do not seem to add much new information for its cost ( e.g. , time , space , clutter ) . Nevertheless , we ran for 50 % Fashion-MNIST , and the result will be included in the paper soon ( before November 24 , 2020 ) . We need more time to finish 50 % and 70 % CIFAR-10 , but we will be able to include the results in the final manuscript . We hope R1 could consider how expensive it is to measure the effect of data parallelism ( please see Appendix B ) . Also , we possess all the other metaparameter search results already for reported sparsity levels to supplement Section 3.2 and Appendix D.2 ; we have not added them yet to avoid redundancy , but please let us know if we need to include them in the appendix . We stress that a data parallelism curve obtained is a result of extensive measurements ( e.g. , R2 `` The empirical evaluation is very exhaustive and conclusive '' , R3 `` Extensive measurements confirm the practical / earlier general knowledge '' ) , and it is no coincidence that the curve presents such a general phenomenon across various workloads . In fact , this is precisely why we developed a theoretical analysis , which confirms the generality of the behavior . * * Budget * * The budget is $ 100 $ trials for each and every study setting ( i.e. , batch size and sparsity ) . To be more specific , for a given workload ( i.e. , a combination of data set , network model , and optimization algorithm ) , we train for the budget of $ 100 $ trials for each batch size and sparsity level , in order to find the best metaparameters and record the lowest steps-to-result ( Appendix B ) . This is in fact indicated in Figure 3 , where there are a total $ 100 $ samples of complete , incomplete , and infeasible cases in each figure of a study setting . We expect that increasing/decreasing the number of trials ( budget ) can make the distribution of the samples more densely/sparsely , but the general appearance will remain the same regardless , forming two distinctive regions of complete and incomplete runs . While we do not study the shape of the boundary separating these regions , we refer to [ 1 ] in which it is derived to be linear as $ \\eta/ ( 1-\\gamma ) $ . * * Infeasible * * Infeasible trials are those that resulted in divergent training . This can happen when the learning rate and/or momentum is too high ( e.g. , loss keeps increasing and eventually diverges ) , and it is observed a lot more when the network is pruned/sparsified , as seen in Figure 3 . This training instability for sparse networks can in fact be explained by our finding that pruning/sparsity decreases Lipschitz smoothness , which causes large changes in gradients and thus , is more vulnerable to diverging under backpropagation during training . * * Figure 2 * * This is the result for the workload ( MNIST , Simple-CNN , and SGD/Momentum/Nesterov ) and study ( batch size ( 2-16384 ) and sparsity levels ( 0 , 50 , 70 , 90 % ) ) settings . Hence , there is no normalization or averaging . We have made this clear in the caption . * * Equation 2 * * Firstly , $ f $ is an objective function to minimize ( e.g. , cross-entropy loss in this work ) , and thus there is no negative infinity . More importantly , Eq.2 is a standard result of the convergence theorem [ 2 ] -- which holds true for any non-convex objective as long as $ 0 < \\bar { \\eta } \\le \\mu/LM_G $ in expectation -- that we chose to take as the basis of our theory of the effect of data parallelism . We note that this result is developed under the standard assumptions on the differentiability of $ f $ , Lipschitz continuity of $ \\nabla f $ , and bounded variance of $ \\nabla f $ , all of which are generally used to study the convergence properties of stochastic optimization methods . * * Maximal data parallelism * * Data parallelism refers to the principle of parallelizing data processing using multiple nodes in a distributed system , so as to accelerate the training process . Note that for the simplest setting of a synchronized distributed system ( which we focus on for the purpose of this work ) , the degree of parallelism equates to the size of mini-batch used for training neural networks on a regular single-node system . Therefore , the term maximal data parallelism means that the size of mini-batch is reached to a point , beyond which increasing the batch size will no longer increase the training speed . We further note that this term is borrowed directly from [ 1 ] ."}, {"review_id": "rsogjAnYs4z-1", "review_text": "The paper presents both practical ( based on measurements ) and theoretical result on the impact of data parallelism and sparsity on the training of neural networks .
