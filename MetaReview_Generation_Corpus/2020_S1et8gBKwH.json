The general consensus was that 3D would be more pertinent use case and that extension of the proposed approach from 2D to 3D is likely non-trivial. The second issue is that minimal technical novelty.

It proposes to learn a generative model of images (a VAE), where the \u2018code\u2019 is factored into a latent vector z and the object rotation r. As in training a VAE, an image encoder that predicts the distribution over (z, r) and the generator are jointly trained, but with additional supervision on the distribution over r for the labelled examples. I think the overall idea of learning a disentangled generative model in a semi-supervised setting is simple and elegant, and could in principle help leverage unlabelled data. However, I do have some concerns regarding the specific contributions of this work, and several reservations about the experiments reported, and would overall argue for rejection. Concerns: 1) The central empirical result stated is that using this approach allows one to reduce amount of labelled data by 10-20 %. First, even if valid, this is not a very convincing reduction in the amount of supervision. However, I feel this claim is not well-established by the experiments: 1a) The paper should report a baseline with only using the loss in eqn 3 and only training the encoder (using various fractions of training data) to predict the rotation i.e. purely discriminative training without training a generative model. The current plots of performance vs fraction of labelled data don't mean much until compared to a similar plot for this baseline. The current results don't really highlight the importance of training the generative model or using the unlabelled data. 1b) I think there are some inconsistencies in performances reported in Fig 2. I assume the test set is same despite different training data, because the paper states \"All of the trained models are evaluated with respect to the complete test set\". In this regard, I am puzzled why using 100% labelled data with 16 renders is significantly better than using 50% labelled data with 32 renders -- these should imply similar number of labelled examples, and more unlabelled ones in the former. 2) While the discussion points to this, the paper would really benefit from having results in a real setting, in particular as pose estimation is a field with a lot of prior methods that have been shown to work in these settings. The current results are all in a setup with synthetic, unoccluded data, without background variation, equidistant camera uniformly sampled along a circle. The central idea of using a generative model would be much more difficult to operationalize in a realistic setting where these simplifying assumptions are not made, and I'd only be convinced about the applicability of the approach by results in that setting.

The interesting part is in combining the supervised and unsupervised parts of the method for the task for pose estimation . But in the end this is a simple weighted loss function ( equation 5 ) . So I wonder what is the novelty ? What are the new capabilities enabled by this approach ? A : With respect to the standard CVAE the choice of the posterior approximate and the prior over the target labels is changed to accommodate the topological properties of the rotations . In this regard , we have incorporated previous work that explores the use of manifolds as latent spaces . As it has been pointed out , one important feature of the method is the possibility to train a regression network that can benefit from both labeled and unlabeled data . Moreover , since the CVAE is a generative model it can be used for view generation of objects although we haven \u2019 t focused on this aspect yet . Nevertheless , we recognize that we would like to explore more novel ideas that incorporate more prior knowledge of the problem into the pose estimation . 2 ) I would have loved to see a description of the differences in the loss functions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) . Perhaps this can help elevate the contribution more ? A : Both loss functions have been presented in already in the original CVAE paper , the difference lies in the choice of the posterior approximate to the labels and the prior over the label space that incorporates the topological properties of rotations . In a future version of this work we will provide a more detailed explanation on this matter . 3 ) I also missed justification of why the particular design choice is suitable for this problem ? Would direct regression using a simple CNN work better ? A : In this problem setting a direct regression would need to take into account first of all the topological properties of rotations . Nevertheless , if such topological properties are incorporated a second problem with using a simple CNN is that it is not completely clear how to deal with unlabeled data . The image reconstruction task within the Variational Autoencoder acts as an auxiliary task that leads the regression network to better rotation predictions when no labels are present . 4 ) In equation ( 4 ) , how are the two losses balanced ? A : We have not yet considered a weighting factor for the loss between labeled and unlabeled data ( we present equal contribution from both sides ) . We are still exploring different approaches for balancing both losses in a principled manner . 5 ) The dataset generation part is just confusing . ModelNet40 is rendered but only 2D rotation is predicted ? What does 2D rotation mean for a 3D object ? A : We consider a 2D rotation as a rotation with respect to a fixed rotation axis which is shared among same classes of objects . This means that we have restricted the dataset to SO ( 2 ) rotations with a fixed rotation axis . In the case of more arbitrary rotations from SO ( 3 ) we need to make some extra geometrical considerations for the choice of our latent space of predictions . We will work to extend the work in a future version of the paper . 6 ) Could this method be tested on a dataset like dSprites ( https : //github.com/deepmind/dsprites-dataset ) which has 3D rotations ? A : Thank you very much for the suggestion we will incorporate such results in the next version of this paper . 7 ) Regarding experiments : I was disappointed to see no comparisons with other approaches or even a simple baseline .

A : Thank you very much for this suggestion . We will include more experiments in a future version of the paper that try to answer such questions and concerns . Overall , we have identified that we are lacking some important experiments to position our method with respect to a baseline . Moreover , our work might lack stronger points of support , we will include experiments with SO ( 3 ) rotations and try to explore different directions to improve our contributions .

In its current state, I am unable to recommend acceptance.", "rating": "1: Reject", "reply_text": "Dear reviewer , I would like to thank you for the time and effort spent in analyzing this paper and for the specific suggestions made to improve this work . We will answer the concerns presented in the review and indicate the future actions to improve the paper . 1 ) The entire section on CVAE 's and losses are quite standard in literature . The interesting part is in combining the supervised and unsupervised parts of the method for the task for pose estimation . But in the end this is a simple weighted loss function ( equation 5 ) . So I wonder what is the novelty ? What are the new capabilities enabled by this approach ? A : With respect to the standard CVAE the choice of the posterior approximate and the prior over the target labels is changed to accommodate the topological properties of the rotations . In this regard , we have incorporated previous work that explores the use of manifolds as latent spaces . As it has been pointed out , one important feature of the method is the possibility to train a regression network that can benefit from both labeled and unlabeled data . Moreover , since the CVAE is a generative model it can be used for view generation of objects although we haven \u2019 t focused on this aspect yet . Nevertheless , we recognize that we would like to explore more novel ideas that incorporate more prior knowledge of the problem into the pose estimation . 2 ) I would have loved to see a description of the differences in the loss functions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) . Perhaps this can help elevate the contribution more ? A : Both loss functions have been presented in already in the original CVAE paper , the difference lies in the choice of the posterior approximate to the labels and the prior over the label space that incorporates the topological properties of rotations . In a future version of this work we will provide a more detailed explanation on this matter . 3 ) I also missed justification of why the particular design choice is suitable for this problem ? Would direct regression using a simple CNN work better ? A : In this problem setting a direct regression would need to take into account first of all the topological properties of rotations . Nevertheless , if such topological properties are incorporated a second problem with using a simple CNN is that it is not completely clear how to deal with unlabeled data . The image reconstruction task within the Variational Autoencoder acts as an auxiliary task that leads the regression network to better rotation predictions when no labels are present . 4 ) In equation ( 4 ) , how are the two losses balanced ? A : We have not yet considered a weighting factor for the loss between labeled and unlabeled data ( we present equal contribution from both sides ) . We are still exploring different approaches for balancing both losses in a principled manner . 5 ) The dataset generation part is just confusing . ModelNet40 is rendered but only 2D rotation is predicted ? What does 2D rotation mean for a 3D object ? A : We consider a 2D rotation as a rotation with respect to a fixed rotation axis which is shared among same classes of objects . This means that we have restricted the dataset to SO ( 2 ) rotations with a fixed rotation axis . In the case of more arbitrary rotations from SO ( 3 ) we need to make some extra geometrical considerations for the choice of our latent space of predictions . We will work to extend the work in a future version of the paper . 6 ) Could this method be tested on a dataset like dSprites ( https : //github.com/deepmind/dsprites-dataset ) which has 3D rotations ? A : Thank you very much for the suggestion we will incorporate such results in the next version of this paper . 7 ) Regarding experiments : I was disappointed to see no comparisons with other approaches or even a simple baseline . A CNN that directly regresses orientation could help put the tables and plots in perspective . Overall , the problem is important ( if lifted to 3D ) with important applications . However , the paper does not say anything new about how to solve the problem and the experiments are weak . In its current state , I am unable to recommend acceptance . A : Thank you very much for this suggestion . We will include more experiments in a future version of the paper that try to answer such questions and concerns . Overall , we have identified that we are lacking some important experiments to position our method with respect to a baseline . Moreover , our work might lack stronger points of support , we will include experiments with SO ( 3 ) rotations and try to explore different directions to improve our contributions . Once again , we would like to thank the reviewer for the time taken into writing a detailed analysis of our work and providing constructive feedback ."}}
