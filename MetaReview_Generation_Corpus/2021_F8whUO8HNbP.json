{"year": "2021", "forum": "F8whUO8HNbP", "title": "Contrastive Syn-to-Real Generalization", "decision": "Accept (Poster)", "meta_review": "The paper raised a natural question: why good synthetic images can be not so good at training/fine-tuning models for downstream tasks (e.g., classification and segmentation)? This problem is named synthetic-to-real (domain) generalization (where syn/real images are regarded as from the source/target domain), and it is of practical importance when using GAN-like methods given limited real images for training. The authors found that the answer to the question is the diversity of the learned feature embeddings, and argued/advocated that we should encourage such diversity when training on syn images in order to better approximate training on real images. To this end, a novel contrastive synthetic-to-real generalization framework was proposed and shown effective in the well designed experiments.\n\nOverall, the quality is above the bar. While some reviewers had some concerns about the applicability and the motivations for the algorithm design, the authors have done a particularly good job in the rebuttal. After the rebuttal, we all think the paper should be accepted for publication.\n\nI have some comments on the writing. The introduction claiming so many things has only 4 citations, especially the first two paragraphs have no citation. While I do think what claimed there are correct, the authors should include certain supportive evidences after each claim by themselves. Moreover, while I do think the problem hunting part is well motivated, the problem solving part needs its own motivation/justification. When two or more components are combined in a proposal, why this component is chosen and is there other choice that can achieve the same purpose (this concern has also been raised by reviewers)? I believe the components are not randomly chosen among possible candidates (e.g., \"we further enhance the CSG framework with attentional pooling\"), but for writing a paper, the authors should explain the motivation for the algorithm design because we cannot know the motivation unless they tell us.", "reviews": [{"review_id": "F8whUO8HNbP-0", "review_text": "Synthetic-to-real generalization is an important topic of extensive practical interest . This paper motivates its work from an observation of feature diversity difference between synthetic and real training : synthetic training tends to generate less diverse or even collapsed features , whereas models trained on natural images give much diverse ones . Based on that , the author developed a contrastive \u201c push and pull \u201d framework to : ( 1 ) keep proximity between learned and ImageNet-pretrained features ; and ( 2 ) push the feature embeddings away from each other across different images , using the feature diversity observation as the inductive bias . Although the proposed formulation looks similar to recent contrastive representation learning , this work seems to be well motivated , and find some unique interpretations for their push and pull in the specific context of syn-to-real generalization . The authors also proposed two variants : a multi-layer contrastive loss applied to intermediate feature map groups ; and a cross-task dense contrastive loss that operates on the batch level for dense supervision . It has been known that CNN tends to focus on textures and hence learns poorly from the less texture-rich synthetic data . It is further great to see the authors show an example illustrating the collapsed representations of a synthetic model , which clearly differs from those from training on real data . This provides a feature-level clear and measurable illustration of syn-real domain gap and implies the insight what good features should behave like in syn-to-real generalization . Experiments were on VisDA-17 ( classification ) and GTA5\u2192Cityscapes ( segmentation ) . Ablation studies were also presented on different augmentation and model components . They also proved again that the diversity of features correlates with generalization performance . While I feel overall positive , a number of questions and concerns remain for the authors : - In Section 2 proof-of-concept , note that VisDA-17 training and validation sets have different sizes . Have you examined the potential confounding facor of different training steps , as longer training might be more prone to forgetting ? I think a controlled experiment here could be training with two equal-sized subsets from VisDA-17 train/val . - Section 3.2 : the authors seem to claim the two augmentations as their innovations , which may need be toned down . Using temporal averaged models inherits from MOCO , and image augmentation is now a standard in contrastive learning . - Further , I wonder why the authors used RandAugment , instead of using the cascaded augmentation ways adopted by MOCO-V2/SimCLR . - Section 3.4 : I am not sure if I fully get the point of A-pool . Is that the same as adding an attention layer in the nonlinear projection head ? - Where is the dense NCE loss applied ? Was it adopted by both classification and segmentation experiments by default , or only in the segmentation ? That was not specified anywhere in the paper .", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "reply_text": "We appreciate your time and efforts ! * * More controlled experiment with equal training size * * Following the suggestion , we conduct another experiment with a randomly sampled subset of VisDA-17 training set which has the same size as the validation set .

An interesting phenomenon is observed in this paper : the diversity of the learned feature embeddings plays an important role in the generalization performance . Then , this paper presents a method to address the syn-to-real generalization problem by combining augmentation , contrastive loss and attention pooling techniques . In general , the observed phenomenon is interesting but the proposed method is not a well-motivated solution . Besides , the researched problem is not a general one , which limits the impact of this paper . Pros : 1.When the source domain only contains synthetic data , this paper observes that the diversity of the learned feature embeddings plays an important role in the generalization performance in Section 2 . From Figure 2 , it is clear that the synthetic data are very different from real data in the view of feature diversity . This phenomenon is interesting and maybe motivate more works regarding syn-to-real problems ( not only the domain generalization problem ) . Cons : 1.This paper provides a new view of addressing the syn-to-real generalization problem . However , the solution presented in this paper is not novel and is not connected with the new view very well . It is not novel enough by only combining augmentation , contrastive loss and attention pooling techniques . 2.The experiments are not enough . For general interest , this paper should also present results when using the proposed method to address ordinary domain generalization problems . The researched problem is not a general one , which limits the impact of this paper . 3.There are many typos in this paper ( even in the abstract : `` that leverage '' should be `` that leverages '' ) . 4.It is unclear why we should use augmentation and A-pool . The motivations behind the two techniques are unclear . Why can they improve the accuracy of the proposed method ?", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We appreciate your time and efforts ! * * Presented solution not novel and not well connected with the new view * * Our proposed methods are strongly motivated to serve the main observation : since synthetic training leads to collapsed embeddings , it is important to leverage diversity as an inductive bias to improve the synthetic training quality . It is this observation that leads to our proposed \u201c push-and-pull \u201d strategy , where \u201c push \u201d promotes features diversity and \u201c pull \u201d encourages knowledge distillation . This \u201c push-and-pull \u201d strategy further motivated the contrastive learning formulation , augmentation and A-pool . Augmentation ( both image and model level ) is a necessary module rather than an add-on for good reasons : Besides conventionally being a highly coupled part of contrastive learning , it creates diverse views that help to overcome overfitting in synthetic training and forces the model to focus on semantically more meaningful parts/structures . In addition , A-pool emphasizes object-centric attention which guides the contrastive learning to semantically more meaningful areas and is uniquely motivated . As also noted by other reviewers , our idea is novel and the proposed approaches are well motivated . * * Present results on ordinary domain generalization * * We fully understand why you have this concern but we kindly disagree . Both synthetic-to-real generalization and domain generalization on natural images present valid and important research topics . There have been many research works on synthetic-to-real generalization/adaptation , and the topic is significant in general robotics/visual reinforcement learning/simulation . The two problems have different motivations despite sharing some overlap , and there is no superiority of one over another per se . We notice that the importance of synthetic-to-real is also acknowledged by some other reviewers as having extensive practical interest . Our idea and proposed methods are uniquely motivated by our observations in synthetic training , and are tailored to specifically address this problem , even though similar techniques may turn out to benefit domain generalization on natural images as well . Our observation that synthetic training tends to result in collapsed features , together with the visualization and quantification using hyperspherical energy , present unique contributions to the community . We believe that the current design of experiments in this work is adequate to support our contributions .

An interesting phenomenon is observed in this paper : the diversity of the learned feature embeddings plays an important role in the generalization performance . Then , this paper presents a method to address the syn-to-real generalization problem by combining augmentation , contrastive loss and attention pooling techniques . In general , the observed phenomenon is interesting but the proposed method is not a well-motivated solution . Besides , the researched problem is not a general one , which limits the impact of this paper . Pros : 1.When the source domain only contains synthetic data , this paper observes that the diversity of the learned feature embeddings plays an important role in the generalization performance in Section 2 . From Figure 2 , it is clear that the synthetic data are very different from real data in the view of feature diversity . This phenomenon is interesting and maybe motivate more works regarding syn-to-real problems ( not only the domain generalization problem ) . Cons : 1.This paper provides a new view of addressing the syn-to-real generalization problem . However , the solution presented in this paper is not novel and is not connected with the new view very well . It is not novel enough by only combining augmentation , contrastive loss and attention pooling techniques . 2.The experiments are not enough . For general interest , this paper should also present results when using the proposed method to address ordinary domain generalization problems . The researched problem is not a general one , which limits the impact of this paper . 3.There are many typos in this paper ( even in the abstract : `` that leverage '' should be `` that leverages '' ) . 4.It is unclear why we should use augmentation and A-pool . The motivations behind the two techniques are unclear . Why can they improve the accuracy of the proposed method ?", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We appreciate your time and efforts ! * * Presented solution not novel and not well connected with the new view * * Our proposed methods are strongly motivated to serve the main observation : since synthetic training leads to collapsed embeddings , it is important to leverage diversity as an inductive bias to improve the synthetic training quality . It is this observation that leads to our proposed \u201c push-and-pull \u201d strategy , where \u201c push \u201d promotes features diversity and \u201c pull \u201d encourages knowledge distillation . This \u201c push-and-pull \u201d strategy further motivated the contrastive learning formulation , augmentation and A-pool . Augmentation ( both image and model level ) is a necessary module rather than an add-on for good reasons : Besides conventionally being a highly coupled part of contrastive learning , it creates diverse views that help to overcome overfitting in synthetic training and forces the model to focus on semantically more meaningful parts/structures . In addition , A-pool emphasizes object-centric attention which guides the contrastive learning to semantically more meaningful areas and is uniquely motivated . As also noted by other reviewers , our idea is novel and the proposed approaches are well motivated . * * Present results on ordinary domain generalization * * We fully understand why you have this concern but we kindly disagree . Both synthetic-to-real generalization and domain generalization on natural images present valid and important research topics . There have been many research works on synthetic-to-real generalization/adaptation , and the topic is significant in general robotics/visual reinforcement learning/simulation . The two problems have different motivations despite sharing some overlap , and there is no superiority of one over another per se . We notice that the importance of synthetic-to-real is also acknowledged by some other reviewers as having extensive practical interest . Our idea and proposed methods are uniquely motivated by our observations in synthetic training , and are tailored to specifically address this problem , even though similar techniques may turn out to benefit domain generalization on natural images as well . Our observation that synthetic training tends to result in collapsed features , together with the visualization and quantification using hyperspherical energy , present unique contributions to the community . We believe that the current design of experiments in this work is adequate to support our contributions . We also believe that machine learning research isn \u2019 t just about universality , but is also about considering data distributions , priors and inductive biases . * * Typos * * Many thanks . We have fixed the typos ."}}
