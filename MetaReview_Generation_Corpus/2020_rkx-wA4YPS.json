The first reviewer's comments were taken seriously in making a decision on this paper. As such, it is my suggestion that the authors revise the paper in its current form, and resubmit, addressing some of the first reviewers comments, such as discussion of utility of the methodology, and to improve the exposition such that less knowledgable reviewers understand the material presented better. The comments that the first reviewer makes about lack of motivation for parts of the presented methodology is reflected in the other reviewers comments, and I'm convinced that the authors can address this issue and make this a really awesome submission at a future conference.\n\nOn a different note, I think the authors should be congratulated on making their results reproducible. That is definitely something the field needs to see more of.", "reviews": [{"review_id": "rkx-wA4YPS-0", "review_text": "This paper builds upon recent work on detecting and correcting for label shift. They explore both the BBSE algorithm analyzed in Detecting and Correcting for Label Shift (2018) and another approach based on EM where the predictive posteriors and test set label distributions are iteratively computed, each an update based on the estimate of the other. Crucially, while the former method requires only that the confusion matrix be invertible, the latter method only appears valid under strong assumptions including the calibration fo the classifier. Thus the authors propose an approach for \u201cbias-corrected calibration\u201d and shows that bias-corrected calibration can improve the performance of BBSE and EM. The method is crucial for EM and with it, the results seem to show that EM, in the large sample (8000 examples) regime and with good initial classifiers (on the relatively easy CIFAR10 task with a strong baseline) that EM outperforms BBSE. The paper is easy to follow an the authors should also be credited for releasing code anonymously with which we could reproduce their results. I have as few specific concerns/questions about the paper that I would like the authors to address: * They consider JS divergence as a metric for evaluation.

Optimizing ELBO with EM can lead to local convergence to the likelihood function when the likelihood is not unimodal. * Is this likelihood function unimodal? Does the EM approach converges to MLE under some appropriate initialization and assumptions? A small presentation note: many of the papers are reporting the same metric and ought to be grouped as a large table, not as many tables. Also every table should state clearly what it is reporting in the caption, not just referring to earlier tables. =======Update I have read the rebuttal and appreciate that the authors took the time to establish the concavity of the likelihood function for EM. Overall this paper makes an interesting contribution in establishing the usefulness of the likelihood formulation (here optimized by EM) of label shift estimation and its apparent benefits over BBSE in some settings. I am happy to keep my score despite apparent disagreement from the other reviewers. I must say that some other reviews were disappointingly lacking in thoroughness. The paper still leaves open some serious questions, e.g. --- why is this bias correction heuristic so effective vis-a-vis EM and is this explained by its performance at the calibration task itself? The original temperature scaling paper reported a similar heuristic yet didn't see such a benefit wrt their metrics. Why is it so useful here?

The paper is well-written and point the interesting problem. But the way of reporting the results are not clear enough. It would be better that the accuracy is reported for the baseline, EM, BBSE-Soft and BBSE-hard at the same table with mean and std values. The tables some how should show the impact of using the calibration to improve significantly the final label shift accuracy.

We would like to highlight the following points : While generalization bounds are beyond the scope of this paper , our work revisits EM as a viable yet missing method from the recent literature ( [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] ) . The EM algorithm comes with strong theoretical grounding when the probabilities are calibrated [ 4 ] . However , at the time when the EM algorithm was introduced for label shift adaptation , research on calibration techniques that are specifically tailored to DNNs had not been conducted . Our contribution is to unify the two lines of research - calibration techniques and domain adaptation - to show that one can achieve strong performance by using calibration in conjunction with the EM algorithm . A key observation that we made is that the popular calibration approach of Temperature Scaling can be improved upon by the addition of class-specific bias parameters . Vector Scaling , which does extend Temperature Scaling by including class-specific bias parameters , was not recommended in the paper that introduced it because it was observed to produce worse performance on the ECE metric , and thus has not been adopted . Our work demonstrates the importance of retaining these class-specific bias parameters in the context of label shift . Until we had investigated the importance of including bias correction , we ourselves were adopting the Temperature Scaling approach . When we proposed an alternative method for calculating source-domain priors for EM in the presence of poor calibration , we provided the appropriate analytical discussion ( lemma 1 , section 3.2 ) . In addition , as requested by Reviewer 2 , we have revised the manuscript to include a proof ( appendix A ) showing that maximizing the likelihood is a convex optimization problem - thus , we can expect EM will converge to a global optimum . Empirically , we verified that this technique enables EM to perform very well at shift estimation across different datasets compared to the recently-introduced Black-Box Shift Estimation , even when the probabilities are not well calibrated .
