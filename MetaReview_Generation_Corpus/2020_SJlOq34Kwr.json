My main original concern was that the empirical evaluation only studies a single type of situation of inferring physical parameters. Given that the authors claim that the proposed method infers \"on the fly\" physical properties, I would expect that the authors demonstrate the the method works on other physical properties as well beyond just one setting. Because this concern was not sufficiently addressed, I maintain my original rating. ---- Summary: This paper tackle the question of learning to infer physical parameters of a novel physical scenario with which to predict future motion of objects. In particular, the authors propose a meta-learning framework for inferring parameters of physical objects from a few video observations of physical scenario, with the constraint that physical parameters are not apparent from appearance alone. The authors evaluate the approach on a domain where the learner needs to infer whether balls should pass above, pass below, or bounce off obstacles. Recommendation: Borderline. The main limitation of the paper is that the empirical evaluation only studies a single type of situation of inferring physical parameters (whether balls should pass above, pass below, or bounce off obstacles) but does not consider other situations for inferring physical parameters for prediction in a new domain. This paper has great potential, but the lack of evaluation on a wider variety of physical phenomena makes it difficult to evaluate the generality of the claims made by this paper. I would highly consider increasing my score if the authors would be able to provide a thorough evaluation of two more types of physical phenomena. Research Problem: The research problem this paper tackles is to learn a model of intuitive physics that can learn \"on the fly\" physical properties specific to new environments. Approach: A meta-network compresses a set of video observations of a scenario using the dynamic image encoding. The meta-network produces context parameters m and a that parameterize the scenario-specific predictor \\hat{Phi} and conditional generator g respectively. The state x is represented with a two-dimensional array. The authors use a perceptual loss as an image reconstruction metric. The author also enforce that the predictions of the state-space predictor and the encoder eta should provide close predictions. Strengths - The meta-learning formalization is an interesting and intuitive contribution. - The experiments provide a proof-of-concept of the efficacy of the framework with thorough analysis. Weaknesses - While the work is well-motivated and the experiments provided show a proof-of-concept of the approach with thorough analysis, the paper could be significantly strengthened by considering more domains for inferring physical parameters - simply inferring whether balls will pass above, pass below, or bounce off obstacles is a good first step, but does not provide enough evidence to evaluate the generality of the proposed method to intuitive physics tasks. This I believe is the main limitation of the paper. Questions - Would the authors be able to provide an empirical study (with qualitative analysis) or theoretical justification to explain the reason why the method can generalize to scenarios with more objects than observed during training? Prior work that does show generalization to more objects explicitly build in the locality constraint (e.g. van Steenkiste 2018) through the network architecture, so it is interesting to see that the proposed method also can generalize similarly.

Thanks for the suggestion , we already provide such an empirical study ( table A3 ) . Our work only used a propagation mechanism which used a shallow fully convolutional network to propagate the state of the system . This was done to keep the internal state spatially distributed . Therefore the receptive field of the network was not big enough to merge two objects together when they were further apart on the board . This was empirically verified in Table A3 .

Due to global image and feature pooling operations, the proposed approach is computationally efficient. Proof-of-concept experiments are presented in a simple simulated physical prediction setting. It is claimed that the proposed model achieves generalization to longer sequences and larger board sizes, as well as a larger number of objects. Decision The work considers an interesting task and shows promise, but the paper lacks a substantial contribution at this time. I recommend weak reject. To improve the paper, I recommend considering harder prediction tasks and lifting some of the restrictions of the method. Pros The paper proposes and evaluates a model for few-shot video prediction, which is an interesting and well-motivated task. Cons 1. The method is only evaluated on a toy task. While a model is proposed that can successfully solve the presented toy task, certain assumptions, such as averaging directly in the image space, may prevent the findings of this paper to scale to more complex tasks, which demands further investigation. 2. It is claimed that the method generalizes to longer sequences and larger board sizes, however, the performance of the method seems to quickly deteriorate in both settings. Authors present anecdotal evidence that the method generalizes to larger number of objects, however, quantitatively the results again are much inferior to the method trained on a larger number of objects. While the presented qualitative generalization findings are interesting, they seem limited in scope, especially when taking into account the simplicity of the considered data. Minor comments 1. On page 3, the paper states \u201cWe are not the first to consider a similar learning problem, although most prior works do require some form of external supervision.\u201d While there is a substantial body of literature that uses extra supervision, the following foundational works do not: Finn et al, 2016a,b; Fragkiadaki, 2016. In addition, \u201ca similar learning problem\u201d is considered without supervision in many papers on video prediction, including: Ranzato et al., 2014; Srivastava et al., 2015; Mathieu et al., 2015; Denton et al., 2017, 2018; Villegas et al., 2017, 2019; Wichers et al., 2018; Castrejon et al., 2019. While it might not be necessary to cite all of these as they do not necessarily apply their models to intuitive physics, the statement in the paper seems rather unsubstantiated. 2. A similar meta-learning prediction problem is addressed in Nagabandi\u201919a,b, which are not cited. 3. The paper is somewhat cluttered with notation, which overall hampers the flow for the reader. The paper would benefit from slight reorganization to improve the flow. This could be done e.g. be structuring the paper to first present the computational task that it addresses, namely few-shot video prediction, and how each component of the model works to address that problem, and only later go into the detail of how the data were collected and how each individual module was implemented Santoro et al, Meta-learning with memory-augmented neural networks.

However, it is clear that the network has trouble maintaining the exact number of spheres in the scene, especially after collisions or interactions with obstacles. While this generalization finding is undoubtedly interesting, I am not convinced it is enough for a publication in ICLR. Furthermore, to support the authors' claim that the prediction performance on long sequences is satisfactory, I suggest comparison with a hand-crafted baseline, such as one suggested by R1, or one that makes use of explicit physics.

The model first learns to convert the set of images to a set of corresponding heatmaps that encode the location of the ball. Then, a recurrent network generates the future states given the first few locations and the output of a network that learns abstract information from the experience runs. The network is trained using reconstruction and perceptual similarity loss. Paper strengths: It is interesting that the model is able to learn from a set of experience runs. Learning abstractions from a set of experience runs is an interesting direction. Paper weaknesses: The paper has two main problems. (1) The model and the experiments are designed for a very simplistic scenario. I do not think that machinery is really needed to perform prediction in this simple setting. (2) The paper needs major re-rewriting. Some of the main parts of the paper are not clear. Please refer to the comments below for more details. - It is unclear how the initialization function (Equation 4) is learned. It is very unlikely that the auto-encoder produces a heatmap of the object locations only based on the reconstruction loss that it receives at the end. This should be clarified. - Equation 2 is very confusing. Is \\phi-hat a function of experience I(E) or I_{0:T}(R). It seems \\phi-hat produces an image that is compared with I(R), but it doesn't seem that M produces an image. - The proposed machinery is overkill for the very simple experimental setup. A nearest neighbor baseline would probably perform as well. We can extract a set of frames in the experience runs that are closest to the first few frames using some simple distance functions. Then, we can predict the future movements by copying the rest of the trajectory from the experience run. - The only part that seems unsupervised is the location of the ball, which can be easily obtained by image subtraction in this simple setting. What else is unsupervised in the proposed approach? - The beginning of section 3.2 mentions w, but there is no mention of it afterwards. - Why does the backprop for sixty 64x64 images require 12Gb of memory? It would be good to explain that. - Regarding the evaluation, how does it know which prediction corresponds to the which groundtruth to compute the distance that is mentioned? The prediction can correspond to any of the balls since there is no explicit notion of object in the model.

Due to the issues mentioned above, especially extremely simple experimental setup and lack of clarity, I chose \"Weak Reject\". ", "rating": "3: Weak Reject", "reply_text": "We thank the reviewer for helpful comments and suggestions . > ( 1 ) The model and the experiments are designed for a very simplistic scenario . I do not think that machinery is really needed to perform prediction in this simple setting . ( This comment was already answered in response to R2 we copy the text here for the reviewer \u2019 s convenience ) While our task may appear simple , it is , in fact , quite challenging due to the unsupervised and image-based nature of the task . Our work should be put in context to related work in intuitive physics . Many papers in this domain work with no images at all ( Chang et al 2017. , Battaglia et al.2017 , Sanchez-Gonzalez et al 2018 ) , with either similar or less complex scenarios . The ones that do use images ( Fragkiadaki et al.2016 ) , assume the renderer to be known thus preventing the objects to disappear over time . Our method not only works with raw images -- just learning to predict the motion of a single ball from raw pixels is non trivial -- but also considers obstacles and multiple balls , each of which is a challenge in its own right ( especially when done from raw pixels with no supervision ) . Finally , we propose a whole new formulation in which the intuitive physics learner can probe new environments on the fly to acquire information about them ( in our case the type of obstacles ) . > - It is unclear how the initialization function ( Equation 4 ) is learned . It is very unlikely that the auto-encoder produces a heatmap of the object locations only based on the reconstruction loss that it receives at the end . This should be clarified . It is in fact possible to learn such map because the initialization function receives signal both from \\Phi and from reconstruction loss at T= { 0 , \u2026 , T_0 } ( This reconstruction loss is already in the paper ( Fig 1 and page 6 ) ) . The loss at { 0 , .. , T_0 } is computed with the only output of \\eta at t= { 0 , ... , T_0 } ( eq ( 4 ) page 5 ) . We further clarified this point in the updated version of the paper ( Appendix A 2.2 ) > - Equation 2 is very confusing . Is \\phi-hat a function of experience I ( E ) or I_ { 0 : T } ( R ) . It seems \\phi-hat produces an image that is compared with I ( R ) , but it does n't seem that M produces an image . M is a meta learner which from past experiences produces a function phi-hat ( autoregressor \\phi +rendering function g see Fig1.top right ) . We have modified the paper to take into account this suggestion as \\Phi ( now \\Omega ) in eq 3 and Section 3.1 was different from the auto-regressor of Fig1 and eq 5 . > - The proposed machinery is overkill for the very simple experimental setup . A nearest neighbor baseline would probably perform as well . We can extract a set of frames in the experience runs that are closest to the first few frames using some simple distance functions . Then , we can predict the future movements by copying the rest of the trajectory from the experience run . It is unclear how such baseline would perform in practice . Since most of the experiences are drawn independently with random starting position and velocity , such baseline would perform poorly and be unable to fulfil one goal of this work i.e to learn propagation and object-environment interactions . Furthermore , the proposed baseline would not be able to propagate the ball state further than 60 steps e.g the size of the observed experiments . > - The only part that seems unsupervised is the location of the ball , which can be easily obtained by image subtraction in this simple setting . What else is unsupervised in the proposed approach ? Apart from the location of the ball , the classification of obstacles { A , U , B } and the auto-regressive model which learnt not only to propagate the ball but also to model it \u2019 s interaction with its environment were unsupervised . Since the location of the objects were also unsupervised it is also a challenging task to maintain a representation of the object over time . > - The beginning of section 3.2 mentions w , but there is no mention of it afterwards . \u2018 w \u2019 refers to the weights of the auto-regressive predictor \\Omega-hat which comprises the auto-regressive network \\Phi and the renderer g. This was clarified in the updated version in Section 3.2 . > - Why does the backprop for sixty 64x64 images require 12Gb of memory ? It would be good to explain that . Our light-weighted network \\Psi was using only 200Mb of memory for backpropagation ( using a batch size of 10 and 7 experiments ) . Since all experiments were using a compact representation each of them could be summed up in only one image . Using an RNN instead of this compact representation would have resulted in an increase of memory footprint equivalent to the number of steps in each experiments e.g. , 60 ."}}
