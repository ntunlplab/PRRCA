One challenge in getting GANs to work is finding the right number of layers , neurons per layer , filter sizes , strides , etc . I 'm curious to learn if DO makes GANs more robust to these choices . In my opinion that would be an important contribution . I would also like to see a discussion of training time for DO versus vanilla training . It 's clear that DO is much more expensive than standard training , but by how much ? Given the extra computation required , is training in 17 epochs vs 20 worth it ? As I said , there is not a lot of originality on the algorithmic side .

GAN is considered a game with an extremely large number of pure strategies , i.e. , possible parameter settings of the generator and discriminator networks . And there are only a few parameter settings which can give the convergence results . While our method also considers mixed NE solution concept , we wanted to propose a framework that can be used in various GAN architectures which originally use SGD so that their training quality is improved . Thus , we first focused on the fundamental architectures to show how much we can improve their performance with DO-framework . 2.Scope of experiments : As shown in Appendix G , we tried one from each category of GAN taxonomy and show our framework \u2019 s ability to improve the results of original architecture . For the case of LOGAN , which is the latent optimization type , we chose SGAN instead due to its architecture using stacked generators/discriminators . We chose Spectral Normalization for Generative Adversarial Networks ( SN-GAN ) [ 1 ] for the regularization type of GAN taxonomy . We leave WGAN since SN-GAN has been shown to perform better . 3.Approximation of NE : We added in the new draft to note that generatorOracle ( ) and discriminatorOracle ( ) are approximate oracle via Adam Optimizer . Although it is approximated , the final strategy at the termination is bounded by \\epsilon . 4.Mixed strategy support set : We found that equilibrium at early-stage training will not be better than newly trained generator/ discriminator from the oracles as there will be better sets of pure strategies . Moreover , according to Appendix D , we can see that larger support set size of pure strategies can give better results at a cost of long training time . However , we chose 10 because it manages to converge according to our termination check and have better results than traditionally trained GAN . According to our investigation , smaller support sets are not able to converge due to infinite pure strategies . 5.Contributions : We applied the DO framework to GAN to investigate how much it can improve the performance of original GAN architectures . We also proposed the termination condition for the DO for GANs and the pruning technique to preserve the storage . 6.Usage of word : PSRO is a double oracle framework used in MARL settings . By \u201c beyond games \u201d , we mean that `` it is also used for multiagent settings '' . In the revised version , we have modified as \u201c DO is also extended to the multi-agent reinforcement learning in PSRO ... \u201d . 7.Time complexity : Computing NE of meta-matrix game and pruning algorithms only take polynomial time and thus , the time efficiency depends on the support set size we set which affects time efficiency of oracles , augmenting the meta-matrix with payoffs , LP and the pruning altogether . Apart from epochs , we also compared with GPU hours . The time taken in GPU hours according to varying support set size is discussed in Appendix D : Table 2 due to the page limit , where larger support set size s=15 takes longer overall time to converge .

Strengths : -- To my knowledge , this is a novel approach which uses new ideas in a related field to potentially help the unstable training of GANs . -- The background preliminaries are thoroughly explained , which is important , as much of this might be new to the target audience . -- The idea of computing losses across iterations to save on the total number of iterations that must be performed is a good one given the high computation costs of GAN training . Weaknesses : -- I found this paper to be poorly written and hard to understand . The game theory language used here is not standard GAN terminology and thus made it difficult for me to follow . -- If model weights themselves are compared/combined across iterations , for example , took me several read-throughs to understand because of unnecessary terminology like calling them `` policies '' and `` meta-game '' which are not used in work on GAN training . -- Not all GAN loss functions are zero-sum ( in fact the best performing models e.g.Big-GAN do not use a zero-sum loss ) , but as I see that is required for this approach , or at least is the only thing that is considered . -- Loss values themselves are not necessarily indicative of generative performance . There are stable equilibria that do not yield good generation , and a different equilibrium at a lower value may or may not be better . As such , only so much can be done with historical loss values . -- I do n't understand how this is supposed to help mode collapse , which is claimed as a beneficial result several times in the results section . To combat mode collapse , it will have to change the way gradients are differentiated for different points . This seems prima facie unrelated to the proposed method , and if it really is causally related , that would be valuable but this needs to be investigated with deeper experimental analysis for it to be claimed . -- The experiments are weak . The toy example is entirely vacuous , as getting a regular GAN to match a handful of modes in 2D is quite possible with any number of small tricks that have been around for years and are not onerous . -- The natural image results are only on CIFAR and CelebA , and are low quality at that . Qualitatively , the generated images still look bad , and the use of a DCGAN as the main baseline is misleading as the vanilla DCGAN is nobody 's standard to beat anymore . Models that have achieved state-of-the-art results in the last couple years like Big-GAN should be included . Conclusion : The motivation for this particular meta-game strategy is not very clear , and the results are not good enough to be relevant to where the current state of GANs are , and as such I vote to reject .", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "reply_text": "Thank you for your valuable suggestions and comments . 1.Terminologies : As we are bridging the two disciplines : GAN and game theory , we try to be consistent . We agree that some reviewers are not familiar with terms from both . So , we provide a corresponding terminology table in the updated draft . We only used the term \u201c policy \u201d to explain the game theory concepts since it is the standard game-theory terminology but not in DO-GAN ( Section 4 ) . 2.Extension to general-sum cases : The definition of GAN is naturally a zero-sum ( minmax ) game where generator and discriminator competing . Even if it is general sum , our approach can be extended to a general sum case which is used in more complex architectures like Big-GAN . Computing the NE of the general sum game , and with termination condition , DO can converge to a scalable alternative of NE ( alpha-rank ) . 3.Use of loss values : Regarding with loss , it is true that loss does not entirely determine the generative performance . We need to check with a more explanative metrics such as FID score . It might be better to use FID score in each iteration , but we will have to trade with the computation complexity . Moreover , we did not change the original architectures that we adapted which define the convergence as when the model \u2019 s loss settles down . After convergence , we evaluated the performance again with the metrics such as Inception Score and FID Score for the proper indicative of generative performance . 4.Mode collapse : DO framework helps with mode collapse since it uses mixed strategy . Mode collapse happens when generator keep using the same strategies that is best response to the discriminator . We agree that the original GAN architectures will have mode collapse since we did not change anything to the architectures . For example , given the first generator converge at one saddle point and suffer mode collapse ( to generate \u201c Class 1 \u201d image ) , the second generator will find another saddle point to get the better utility . Even if it suffers another mode collapse ( to generate \u201c Class 2 \u201d image ) and same for another 8 generators , 10 different generators having different saddle points will generate different images with a probability distribution . 5.2D experiments : Small tricks are possible to achieve generating to a few modes . But the normal GAN training depends on hyperparameters and leads to instability needing for small tricks . Our purpose is to consider a mixed NE so as not to depend on the hyperparmeter settings . 6.Experiments with Real-world datasets : a ) While qualitative evaluation is subjective , the quantitative experiment shows that our approach can converge faster and generate competitive quality images than original architectures . We believe our method can obtain competitive or better quantitative results on inception score and FID score compared with original counterparts . b ) This study is the first step to apply DO to GANs , providing a general framework . Our DO framework can be further explored to be adapted to better single architectures like BigGAN to improve the performance . c ) However , for Network architecture-based taxonomy of GANs , we chose DCGAN instead of more advanced architecture such as BigGAN due to the computation facility since it is intended for large industrial applications . d ) Given better computational facility , DO can be adapted to more complex SOTA architectures . As far as we concern , the architectures alternately update the generator and discriminator , i.e. , loss and backpropagation are separate for the generator and discriminator .

In fact , the authors have this line about Hsieh et al `` The sampling approach may be inefficient to compute mixed NE as the mixed NE may only have a few strategies with positive probabilities in the infinite strategy space '' - do the authors have any evidence ( theory or experiment ) to support this ? - The evaluation , while exploring many GANs , is missing a few recent ones . Have the authors tried LOGAN ( achieves same scores almost of CIFAR ) . Also , wondering why WGAN is not considered - WGAN also is a game and actually better than some of the GANs tested . - Clearly the NE is not being computed exactly because of the many approximations ( e.g. , approximate best response ) . - It is very surprising that only 10 pure strategies are enough in the mixed strategy support when the pure strategy space is infinite - there are results on small support for approximate NE ( please cite those also ) . I am not sure though if it is so small , the lack of rigor here is unconvincing . - There is no new technique in the way double oracle is used . That makes it seem like an engineering effort . - Can some of the other approaches in PSRO framework work better than double oracle ? ( why do you the authors call PSRO use as `` beyond games '' , PSRO is still being used in a game , just a very large game ) - I do not think comparing time by comparing epochs is fine - does n't the double oracle epochs include Nash equilbrium computation . Please state these clearly .", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "Thank you for your valuable suggestions and comments . 1.Comparison with Mirror Descent : Hsieh et al ICML2019 proposed a Mirror Descent method which considers mixed NE solution concept to replace Stochastic Gradient Descent . GAN is considered a game with an extremely large number of pure strategies , i.e. , possible parameter settings of the generator and discriminator networks . And there are only a few parameter settings which can give the convergence results . While our method also considers mixed NE solution concept , we wanted to propose a framework that can be used in various GAN architectures which originally use SGD so that their training quality is improved . Thus , we first focused on the fundamental architectures to show how much we can improve their performance with DO-framework . 2.Scope of experiments : As shown in Appendix G , we tried one from each category of GAN taxonomy and show our framework \u2019 s ability to improve the results of original architecture . For the case of LOGAN , which is the latent optimization type , we chose SGAN instead due to its architecture using stacked generators/discriminators . We chose Spectral Normalization for Generative Adversarial Networks ( SN-GAN ) [ 1 ] for the regularization type of GAN taxonomy . We leave WGAN since SN-GAN has been shown to perform better . 3.Approximation of NE : We added in the new draft to note that generatorOracle ( ) and discriminatorOracle ( ) are approximate oracle via Adam Optimizer . Although it is approximated , the final strategy at the termination is bounded by \\epsilon . 4.Mixed strategy support set : We found that equilibrium at early-stage training will not be better than newly trained generator/ discriminator from the oracles as there will be better sets of pure strategies . Moreover , according to Appendix D , we can see that larger support set size of pure strategies can give better results at a cost of long training time . However , we chose 10 because it manages to converge according to our termination check and have better results than traditionally trained GAN . According to our investigation , smaller support sets are not able to converge due to infinite pure strategies . 5.Contributions : We applied the DO framework to GAN to investigate how much it can improve the performance of original GAN architectures . We also proposed the termination condition for the DO for GANs and the pruning technique to preserve the storage . 6.Usage of word : PSRO is a double oracle framework used in MARL settings . By \u201c beyond games \u201d , we mean that `` it is also used for multiagent settings '' . In the revised version , we have modified as \u201c DO is also extended to the multi-agent reinforcement learning in PSRO ... \u201d . 7.Time complexity : Computing NE of meta-matrix game and pruning algorithms only take polynomial time and thus , the time efficiency depends on the support set size we set which affects time efficiency of oracles , augmenting the meta-matrix with payoffs , LP and the pruning altogether . Apart from epochs , we also compared with GPU hours . The time taken in GPU hours according to varying support set size is discussed in Appendix D : Table 2 due to the page limit , where larger support set size s=15 takes longer overall time to converge .

Strengths : -- To my knowledge , this is a novel approach which uses new ideas in a related field to potentially help the unstable training of GANs . -- The background preliminaries are thoroughly explained , which is important , as much of this might be new to the target audience . -- The idea of computing losses across iterations to save on the total number of iterations that must be performed is a good one given the high computation costs of GAN training . Weaknesses : -- I found this paper to be poorly written and hard to understand . The game theory language used here is not standard GAN terminology and thus made it difficult for me to follow . -- If model weights themselves are compared/combined across iterations , for example , took me several read-throughs to understand because of unnecessary terminology like calling them `` policies '' and `` meta-game '' which are not used in work on GAN training . -- Not all GAN loss functions are zero-sum ( in fact the best performing models e.g.Big-GAN do not use a zero-sum loss ) , but as I see that is required for this approach , or at least is the only thing that is considered . -- Loss values themselves are not necessarily indicative of generative performance . There are stable equilibria that do not yield good generation , and a different equilibrium at a lower value may or may not be better . As such , only so much can be done with historical loss values . -- I do n't understand how this is supposed to help mode collapse , which is claimed as a beneficial result several times in the results section . To combat mode collapse , it will have to change the way gradients are differentiated for different points . This seems prima facie unrelated to the proposed method , and if it really is causally related , that would be valuable but this needs to be investigated with deeper experimental analysis for it to be claimed . -- The experiments are weak . The toy example is entirely vacuous , as getting a regular GAN to match a handful of modes in 2D is quite possible with any number of small tricks that have been around for years and are not onerous . -- The natural image results are only on CIFAR and CelebA , and are low quality at that . Qualitatively , the generated images still look bad , and the use of a DCGAN as the main baseline is misleading as the vanilla DCGAN is nobody 's standard to beat anymore . Models that have achieved state-of-the-art results in the last couple years like Big-GAN should be included . Conclusion : The motivation for this particular meta-game strategy is not very clear , and the results are not good enough to be relevant to where the current state of GANs are , and as such I vote to reject .", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "reply_text": "Thank you for your valuable suggestions and comments . 1.Terminologies : As we are bridging the two disciplines : GAN and game theory , we try to be consistent . We agree that some reviewers are not familiar with terms from both . So , we provide a corresponding terminology table in the updated draft . We only used the term \u201c policy \u201d to explain the game theory concepts since it is the standard game-theory terminology but not in DO-GAN ( Section 4 ) . 2.Extension to general-sum cases : The definition of GAN is naturally a zero-sum ( minmax ) game where generator and discriminator competing . Even if it is general sum , our approach can be extended to a general sum case which is used in more complex architectures like Big-GAN . Computing the NE of the general sum game , and with termination condition , DO can converge to a scalable alternative of NE ( alpha-rank ) . 3.Use of loss values : Regarding with loss , it is true that loss does not entirely determine the generative performance . We need to check with a more explanative metrics such as FID score . It might be better to use FID score in each iteration , but we will have to trade with the computation complexity . Moreover , we did not change the original architectures that we adapted which define the convergence as when the model \u2019 s loss settles down . After convergence , we evaluated the performance again with the metrics such as Inception Score and FID Score for the proper indicative of generative performance . 4.Mode collapse : DO framework helps with mode collapse since it uses mixed strategy . Mode collapse happens when generator keep using the same strategies that is best response to the discriminator . We agree that the original GAN architectures will have mode collapse since we did not change anything to the architectures . For example , given the first generator converge at one saddle point and suffer mode collapse ( to generate \u201c Class 1 \u201d image ) , the second generator will find another saddle point to get the better utility . Even if it suffers another mode collapse ( to generate \u201c Class 2 \u201d image ) and same for another 8 generators , 10 different generators having different saddle points will generate different images with a probability distribution . 5.2D experiments : Small tricks are possible to achieve generating to a few modes . But the normal GAN training depends on hyperparameters and leads to instability needing for small tricks . Our purpose is to consider a mixed NE so as not to depend on the hyperparmeter settings . 6.Experiments with Real-world datasets : a ) While qualitative evaluation is subjective , the quantitative experiment shows that our approach can converge faster and generate competitive quality images than original architectures . We believe our method can obtain competitive or better quantitative results on inception score and FID score compared with original counterparts . b ) This study is the first step to apply DO to GANs , providing a general framework . Our DO framework can be further explored to be adapted to better single architectures like BigGAN to improve the performance . c ) However , for Network architecture-based taxonomy of GANs , we chose DCGAN instead of more advanced architecture such as BigGAN due to the computation facility since it is intended for large industrial applications . d ) Given better computational facility , DO can be adapted to more complex SOTA architectures . As far as we concern , the architectures alternately update the generator and discriminator , i.e. , loss and backpropagation are separate for the generator and discriminator . In such case , we can easily adapt to DO framework with oracles to provide the best responses ."}}
