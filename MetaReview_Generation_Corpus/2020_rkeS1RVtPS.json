{"year": "2020", "forum": "rkeS1RVtPS", "title": "Cyclical Stochastic Gradient MCMC for Bayesian Deep Learning", "decision": "Accept (Talk)", "meta_review": "This paper proposes a novel stochastic gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo method incorporating a cyclical step size schedule (cyclical SG-MCMC).  The authors argue that this step size schedule allows the sampler to cross modes (when the step size is large) and locally explore modes (when the step size is smaller).  SG-MCMC is a very promising method for Bayesian deep learning as it is both scalable and easily to incorporate into existing models.  However, the stochastic setting often leads to the sampler getting stuck in a local mode due to a requirement of a small step size (which itself is often due to leaving out the Metropolis-Hastings accept / reject step).   The cyclic learning rate intuitively helps the sampler escape local modes.  This property is demonstrated on synthetic problems in comparison to existing SG-MCMC baselines.  The authors demonstrate improved negative log likelihood on larger scale deep learning benchmarks, which is appreciated as the related literature often restricts experiments to small scale problems.  The reviewers all found the paper compelling and argued for acceptance and thus the recommendation is to accept.  Some questions remain for future work.  E.g. all experiments were performed using a very low temperature, which implies that the methods are not sampling from the true Bayesian posterior.  Why is such a low temperature needed for reasonable performance?  In any case a very nice paper.", "reviews": [{"review_id": "rkeS1RVtPS-0", "review_text": "The paper propose a new MCMC scheme which is demonstrated to perform well for estimating Bayesian neural networks. The key idea is to not keep lowering the step sizes, but -- at pre-specified times -- go back to large step sizes. The paper is timely, the proposed algorithm is novel, and the theoretical analysis also seem quite novel. My key concern is that with MCMC sampling it is often quite difficult to tune parameters, and by introducing more parameters to tune when step sizes should increase, I fear that we end up in a \"tuning nightmare\". How sensitive is the algorithm to choice of parameters? I would expect that the proposed algorithm is quite similar to just running several MCMCs in parallel. The authors does a comparison to this and show that their approach is significantly faster due to \"warm restarts\". Here I wonder how sensitive this conclusion is to choice of parameters (see nightmare above) ? I would guess that opposite conclusions could be reached by tuning the algorithms differently -- is that a reasonable suspicion ? It is argued that the cyclic nature of the algorithms gives a form of \"warm start\" that is beneficial for MCMC. My intuition dictate that this is only true of the modes of the posterior are reasonable close to each other; otherwise I do not see how this warm starting is helpful.

Q1 : Tuning hyperparameters A1 : We have found performance robust to hyperparameter settings . There are only two additional hyperparameters compared to standard SG-MCMC methods : the number of cycles $ M $ and the proportion of exploration stage $ \\beta $ . Given the training budget , there is a trade-off between the number of cycles $ M $ and the cycle length . We find that it works well in practice to set the cycle length such that the model with optimization methods will be close to a mode after running for that length , but it is not too sensitive to this value . ( e.g.the cycle length for CIFAR-10 is 50 epochs . The model optimized by SGD can achieve about 5 % error after 50 epochs which means the model is close but not fully converged to a mode after 50 epochs . ) Once the cycle length is fixed , $ M $ is fixed . $ \\beta $ needs tuning for different tasks by cross-validation . Generally , $ \\beta $ needs to be tuned so that the sampler has enough time to reach a good region before starting sampling . We have added a discussion about hyperparameter tuning in Appendix . As per below ( Q2 ) , we have found performance robust to $ M $ and $ \\beta $ . Q2 : How sensitive the conclusion of superiority over parallel MCMC is to the choice of parameters A2 : To test the sensitivity , we added an experiment in Appendix . H. With the same setup as in the experiment section , we compare our method with $ M $ cycles and $ L $ epochs per cycle with running $ M $ chains parallel MCMC for $ L $ epochs . The training budget is 200 epochs . We compare cSGLD and parallel SGLD with smaller and larger values of $ M $ and $ \\beta $ on CIFAR-10 ( $ M=4 $ and $ \\beta=0.8 $ in the experiment section ) .

In other words , high performing solutions in the weight space of neural networks are likely to be reasonably close to each other . Our method is developed particularly for Bayesian deep learning and we have demonstrated its effectiveness for modeling the posterior in Bayesian neural networks .

In the experiments in this paper , we used the same ResNet architecture for all methods and compare our methods to both related sampling methods and optimization methods ( Bayesian and non-Bayesian ) .
