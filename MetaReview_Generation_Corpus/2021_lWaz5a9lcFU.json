Cons : 1 ) We believe there is a misunderstanding regarding our approach . Our system does not use a network pre-trained on ImageNet as Style Transfer Network .

The new experiment has shown further insights into the effectiveness of our approach for continual learning . Concerns : 1 ) it seems obvious improving image quality will result in better performance for methods based on replay : We agree that improving image quality is an obvious way to improve performance . However , improving image quality is not a simple task , especially when using limited memory . As shown in the results from earlier papers ( Shin et al.2017 , Wu et al.2018a , Ostapenko et al.2019 ) , the regenerated images are not even close to the original images , hence the overall accuracy decreases drastically , especially for ImageNet-50 even with images of size 32 $ \\times $ 32 . Thus , in this paper , we propose the NST based autoencoder to improve image quality while utilizing lower memory . Further , note that the reconstructed images can not be the same as original images , especially when using limited memory . Thus , we introduce weight decay and image filtering techniques ( Section 3.3 ) to deal with image degradation during reconstruction so that degraded images do not hurt classifier performance . FearNet does not use any of these ideas . FearNet simply uses a network pre-trained on ImageNet to extract features , which is a limitation since it can only be applied on object-centric image datasets . Further , using the pre-trained feature extractor gives FearNet an unfair advantage over other approaches . The only similarity between EEC and FearNet , other than the use of autoencoders , is that they both use pseudorehearsal . However , FearNet only uses a single centroid and covariance matrix to represent the feature space of a class . In contrast we use memory integration-based clustering approach to better cover the complete feature space . We have added a new experiment in Appendix E to compare pseudorehearsal in EEC and FearNet . This experiment demonstrates that unlike FearNet , EEC captures the overall concept of the original feature space . Experiments on CIFAR-100 ( Appendix D ) show that EEC outperforms FearNet by a margin of 10.5\\ % , which shows the effectiveness of our approach in comparison with FearNet . 2 ) It would be interesting to see the performance on more challenging datasets with large resolution and more tasks : The only reason to use the four datasets ( with images of size 32 $ \\times $ 32 ) in the paper was to have a fair comparison with other generative memory based approaches . However , to have a comparison with more episodic memory based approaches on a larger dataset with more classes , we added an experiment on CIFAR-100 in Appendix D. These results show that EEC outperforms other SOTA approaches even on a larger dataset . To test EEC on images with higher resolution , we have added a new experiment in the paper ( Section 4.5 ) . We performed the experiment on ImageNet-50 dataset with images of size 224 $ \\times $ 224 . The results show that EEC produces significantly higher accuracy when using higher resolution images than when using lower resolution images . Further , the memory required for EEC remains the same regardless of the image resolution , which demonstrates the effectiveness of EEC to mitigate catastrophic forgetting while using significantly less memory that other approaches ."}, {"review_id": "lWaz5a9lcFU-2", "review_text": "In continual learning settings , one of the important technique for avoiding catastrophe forgetting is to replay data points from the past .

Basic Concerns : 1 ) Idea of generating new samples for replay is not motivated well enough : As described in previous works ( Rebuffi et al.2017 , Castro et al.2018 ) , one of the main problems faced by continual learning systems is to learn new tasks for a long period of time while using limited memory . Our paper , similar to previous works ( iCaRL , EEIL etc . ) , perform experiments on benchmark datasets for a proof of concept and to have a fair comparison with previous works in continual learning . Because of the limited sizes of the datasets ( and some datasets with low resolution images ) , even storing the complete datasets require memory in few hundred MBs . However , in real-world applications , as the number of new tasks continue to increase , the memory required to store the previous data will go out of bounds , since many real-world systems have limited on-board memory which can be in the range of a few GBs . As an example , we have added a new experiment in the paper ( Section 4.5 ) , in which we perform the continual learning experiment on ImageNet-50 dataset with images of size 224 $ \\times $ 224 . The total memory required to store all 65000 images belonging to only 50 classes requires 13.04 GB , which can cause a huge memory strain on the system . As the number of classes increase , this memory can easily go out of bounds . However , EEC only requires a maximum of 111.56 MB for the 50 classes ( Section 4.5 ) , which shows the significance of our approach to cope with limited memory . 2 ) why is there a need for generating new samples ? : We agree that there are some techniques proposed to get a representative set of original samples . Some continual learning approaches , such as iCaRL and EEIL have used these techniques to store a representative set of original samples . However , as shown in the experimental results ( Table 1 ) , the approaches that store some original images of the old classes produce significantly lower accuracy compared to EEC and they start to suffer from catastrophic forgetting in the later increments . Simply storing a representative set of original images does not solve the catastrophic forgetting problem and leads to further issues like privacy and security , as argued by ( Ostapenko et al.2019 ) and in our paper ( Section 1 ) . 3 ) Why not use conditional-GANs ( CGAN ) for generating data points specific to a class ? : We agree that using CGANs is a way to solve the problem of generating images belonging to no classes . However , the generated images are still not perfect . We have performed an experiment with CGAN on ImageNet-50 dataset and added it in the ablation study in the paper ( Section 4.4 ) . Results in Table 2 show that CGAN does not solve the problem of generating perfect images . Further , note that CGAN produces similar accuracy to other autoencoders that do not use the content loss , which shows that CGAN is not even an improvement over autoencoders without the content loss , even though these autoencoders produces blurry images ( Figure 2 ) . Pseudorehearsal is not principled enough : Pseudo-rehearsal is an intuitive and empirical technique inspired by the learning models in the brain ( Robins , 1995 ) , which has been used by previous works like FearNet ( Kemker \\ & Kanan 2018 ) . Because of lack of mathematical explanation , we have provided an empirical experiment to visually show how our technique works ( Figures 3 and 5 ) . This empirical experiment ( Figure 3 and 5 ) and experiments with limited memory in Section 4.3 show the effectiveness of pseudorehearsal . Pseudorehearsal may or may not work depending upon the intrinsic dimensionality of images , and the difficulty of the task : Note that the dimensionality of the images does not have an effect on pseudorehearsal , since it is applied on the feature vectors produced by the autoencoders ( see Section 4.5 for details ) . Also , we have tested our continual learning approach on the classification task with multiple datasets of varying difficulty levels and the empirical evaluations show that pseudorehearsal produced favorable results ."}], "0": {"review_id": "lWaz5a9lcFU-0", "review_text": "# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Summary : The paper proposes an approach which trains autoencoders with Neural Style Transfer to encode and store images .
