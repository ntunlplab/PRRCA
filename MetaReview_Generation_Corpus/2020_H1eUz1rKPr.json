The approach is built on top of the DeepSets (Zaheer et al., 2017) model, which already is capable of learning representations of multisets, with a new objective of predicting the size of symmetric differences between two multisets, plus a small change in the implementation of the DeepSets model by restricting the per-element module to output a point in the probability simplex. I liked the background on fuzzy sets and the development of fuzzy multisets and different operations on these multisets. The definitions and arguments are quite clear and helpful. One small suggestion for page 4 is that I can understand why the formulation is the only sensible choice for multisets with desired properties, but a claim like this deserves a proper proof. Model-wise the paper made two contributions for learning representations for multisets as mentioned above: (1) proposed the symmetric difference prediction as a task for learning representations, the argument for this task is that predicting symmetric difference implicitly encourages the model to learn about containment; (2) a slight change in the DeepSets model architecture where the outer rho function is identity and the inner phi function has to output a point in the simplex. I found these technical contributions to be a bit small. In addition to this, the paper only presents results on MNIST in a toyish setting, this makes me feel the paper may be more suited for publication in a workshop (idea is interesting, small scale experiments to illustrate the insights, but not complete enough to be published at a conference). Regarding contribution (1), I can see why predicting symmetric difference makes sense as argued in the paper, but I\u2019m not convinced that this is better than other alternatives. In order to show that this is a reasonable approach for learning representations, some results that compare this with other possible learning objectives would be necessary. But I don\u2019t see any such results in this paper.
