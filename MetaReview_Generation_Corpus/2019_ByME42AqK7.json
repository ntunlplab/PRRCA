I will say it first that experiments in the paper only actually address to constraints, namely: log(#params) and (accuracy on CIFAR-10), and the method as currently presented does not show possible generalization beyond these two objectives, which is a weakness of the paper. Anyhow, for the sake of summary, let\u2019s say the method can actually address multiple, i.e. more than 2, objectives. The method works as follows. 1. Start with an architecture. 2. Apply network morphisms, i.e. operators that change a network\u2019s architecture but also select some weights that do not strongly alter the function that the network represents. Which operations to apply are sampled according to log(#params). Details are in the paper. 3. From those sampled networks, the good ones are kept, and the evolutionary process is repeated. The authors propose to use operations such as \u201cNet2WiderNet\u201d and \u201cNet2DeeperNet\u201d from Chen et al (2015), which enlarge the network but also choose a set of appropriate weights that do not alter the function represented by the network. The authors also propose operations that reduce the network\u2019s size, whilst only slightly change the function that the network represented. Experiments in the paper show that LEMONADE finds architecture that are Pareto-optimal compared to existing model. While this seems like a big claim, in the context of this paper, this claim means that the networks found by LEMONADE are not both slower and more wrong than existing networks, hand-crafted or automatically designed. Strengths: 1. The method solves a real and important problem: efficiently search for neural networks that satisfy multiple properties. 2. Pareto optimality is a good indicator of whether a proposed algorithm works on this domain, and the experiments in the paper demonstrate that this is the case. Weaknesses: 1. How would LEMONADE handle situations when there are more than one $f_{cheap}$, especially when different $f_{cheap}$ may have different value ranges? Eqn (8) and Eqn (9) does not seem to handle these cases. 2. Same question with $f_{exp}$. In the paper the only $f_{exp}$ refers to the networks\u2019 accuracy on CIFAR-10. What happens if there are multiple objectives, such as (accuracy on CIFAR-10, accuracy on ImageNet) or (accuracy on CIFAR-10, accuracy on Flowers, image segmentation on VOC), etc. I thus think the \u201cMulti-Objective\u201d is a bit overclaimed, and I strongly recommend that the authors adjust their claim to be more specific to what their method is doing. 3. What value of $\\epsilon$ in Eqn (1) is used? Frankly, I think that if the authors train their newly generated children networks using some gradient descent methods (SGD, Momentum, Adam, etc.), then how can they guarantee the \\epsilon-ANM condition? Can you clarify and/or change the presentation regarding to this part? ", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Dear AnonReviewer1 , thank you for your positive and constructive feedback . Below we address your concerns and questions . \u201c What value of $ \\epsilon $ in Eqn ( 1 ) is used ? [ ... ] how can they guarantee the \\epsilon-ANM condition ? \u201d \u2192 Indeed , one can not guarantee the \\epsilon-ANM condition for an arbitrary epsilon . However , in our application one does not need to explicitly select $ \\epsilon $ at all . We simply apply an approximate network morphism operator . Case 1 , epsilon is small : the output is a network that is \u201c smaller \u201d than its parent and has a similar error , so the children will likely be non-dominated and it will be part of the pareto front in the next generation . Case 2 , epsilon is large ( hence likely also the error ) : the children will likely be dominated by some other network and it will be discarded when the Pareto front is updated . Thus , in both cases , the specific epsilon doesn \u2019 t matter . The step of LEMONADE , where the Pareto front is updated , will automatically decide whether the morphing was successful or not based on the ( non- ) domination criterion . We updated ( shortened ) the section on approximate network morphism to not put a too strong emphasis on this . Hopefully it is now less confusing . \u201c [ ... ] the method as currently presented does not show possible generalization beyond these two objectives , which is a weakness of the paper. \u201d - > We respectfully disagree . In principle , the proposed method is - as is - applicable to arbitrary objectives and arbitrary many objectives . It is neither restricted to these specific objectives nor to n=2 objectives . To demonstrate this , we carried out a new experiment with exactly the same method on 5 objectives ( 2 expensive ones , 3 cheap ones ) . We refer to the additional experiment , Appendix 3 ( \u201c LEMONADE with 5 objectives \u201d ) , in the updated version of our paper . \u201c How would LEMONADE handle situations when there are more than one $ f_ { cheap } $ , especially when different $ f_ { cheap } $ may have different value ranges ? Eqn ( 8 ) and Eqn ( 9 ) does not seem to handle these cases. \u201d - > Both equations are not restricted to 1D inputs . ( Kernel ) density estimators can , in general , be applied to arbitrary dimensions and most packages allow multi-dimensional inputs by default ( e.g.KDE in scipy or scikit-learn ) . Of course , density estimation becomes problematic with increasing number of dimensions , but we believe 4-6 objectives is a realistic dimensionality for NAS applications , and scaling to significantly more objectives will typically not be necessary . Note that the output of a KDE is always 1D , independent of the input . Also , most packages provide methods for , e.g. , automatic bandwidth computation ( per input dimension ) to handle different value ranges . To make the input and output spaces in equations 8,9 ( equations 1,2 in the updated version ) clearer , we provide them in detail here : f_cheap : < some neural network space > \u2192 R^n , where n is the number of cheap objectives p_kde : R^n \u2192 R p_p : < some neural network space > \u2192 R \u201c Same question with $ f_ { exp } $ . \u201d \u2192 The expensive objectives are only involved in the last two steps of LEMONADE ( evaluate $ f_ { exp } $ on the subset of children , update the Pareto frontier ) . These steps can be applied to more than one expensive objective . E.g.instead of training the children only on CIFAR-10 , we can also train them on some other data set as well ( and in our new experiment with 5 objectives we indeed also train them on CIFAR-100 as a second expensive objective ) . Of course , the runtime of the method will increase linearly in the number of expensive objectives . So , to summarize regarding having only 2 objectives : 1 ) Our method can in principle handle more than 2 objectives ( both cheap and expensive ) , there is no general restriction to n=2 objectives . 2 ) From an implementation point of view , common packages for computing density estimators automatically deal with multi-dimensional inputs and different ranges , hence LEMONADE can be run - as is - with multi-dimensional objectives without any further user interaction or modifications . 3 ) To confirm these statements , we ran an additional experiment with 5 objectives - 2 expensive ones ( performances on Cifar-10 , performance on Cifar-100 ) and 3 cheap ones ( number of parameters , number of multiply-add operations , inference time ) . We refer to Appendix 3 , \u201c LEMONADE with 5 objectives \u201d , in the updated version of our paper for details and results . We hope this clarifies your questions .

To make the input and output spaces in equations 8,9 ( equations 1,2 in the updated version ) clearer , we provide them in detail here : f_cheap : < some neural network space > \u2192 R^n , where n is the number of cheap objectives p_kde : R^n \u2192 R p_p : < some neural network space > \u2192 R \u201c Same question with $ f_ { exp } $ . \u201d \u2192 The expensive objectives are only involved in the last two steps of LEMONADE ( evaluate $ f_ { exp } $ on the subset of children , update the Pareto frontier ) . These steps can be applied to more than one expensive objective . E.g.instead of training the children only on CIFAR-10 , we can also train them on some other data set as well ( and in our new experiment with 5 objectives we indeed also train them on CIFAR-100 as a second expensive objective ) . Of course , the runtime of the method will increase linearly in the number of expensive objectives . So , to summarize regarding having only 2 objectives : 1 ) Our method can in principle handle more than 2 objectives ( both cheap and expensive ) , there is no general restriction to n=2 objectives . 2 ) From an implementation point of view , common packages for computing density estimators automatically deal with multi-dimensional inputs and different ranges , hence LEMONADE can be run - as is - with multi-dimensional objectives without any further user interaction or modifications . 3 ) To confirm these statements , we ran an additional experiment with 5 objectives - 2 expensive ones ( performances on Cifar-10 , performance on Cifar-100 ) and 3 cheap ones ( number of parameters , number of multiply-add operations , inference time ) . We refer to Appendix 3 , \u201c LEMONADE with 5 objectives \u201d , in the updated version of our paper for details and results . We hope this clarifies your questions .
