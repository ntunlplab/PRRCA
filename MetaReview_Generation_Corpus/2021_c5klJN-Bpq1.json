The most critical argument is that the model generalizes decision tree while maintaining interpretability .

Any classifier $ p ( y | x ) $ can be written as a decision transformer $ F \\pi_0 $ by letting $ \\pi_0 = [ 1 ] $ and $ F = p ( y | x ) $ . The factorization only makes intuitive sense when each $ T_i $ is restricted / interpretable . 3.Interpreting a stochastically routing decision tree would inevitably involve inspecting the whole tree , since every prediction involves the whole tree . Hence , visualizing the whole tree is necessary to claim interpretability , especially for a new architecture .

I still believe that this paper is not ready for acceptance . Summary : The authors present `` decision transformers , '' a family of classifiers of which decision trees ( DTs ) are a subset . They present `` Decision Transformer Networks '' ( DTNs ) , which are a type of decision transformer where the number of nodes per layer is constant , the decision boundaries are soft , and the nodes are linked more densely than standard DTs . DTNs are experimentally compared to soft DTs , MLPs , and DTs , where the authors believe DTNs perform better than the alternatives . Also , the authors demonstrate that a decision transformer can be explained in terms of a score function if it has no non-linearities or bias terms between transition functions . Reasons for score : DTNs are not shown to perform better than existing non-interpretable methods . DTNs are not shown to be interpretable in the sense that tree models are interpretable . DTNs may exhibit a favorable trade-off between accuracy and interpretability , but determining this requires defining and measuring interpretability . Pros : -Decision transformers are explained very clearly and may be useful in future analysis of DT-style models . -Initial results for DTNs are favorable , so DTNs may be further refined and yield a good architecture . -The ablation study ( Section 5.3 ) is a great inclusion which allows others to extend DTNs . Cons : -The authors note that `` with the integration of deep neural networks ... the interpretability of tree models in general becomes questionable , '' but the proposed method is effectively integrating single-layer networks into its many transition matrices . The evaluated models have 16 layers with 128 nodes per layer ( obtained from code ; not entirely clear from paper text ) , use soft non-linearities , and have more connections than a tree-structured model . The paper would be improved by a clearer demonstration of the `` tree '' nature of the proposed model or how it could be interpreted in tree-like ways . -The theoretical analysis for interpretability does not apply to models `` if a nonlinear activation function or a bias term exists between transition matrices '' . However , the non-linearity and bias terms have simply been moved into the transition matrices . As a result , the score function explanations are oblivious to the contents of the transition matrices . -Explanations in terms of importance values on input features are also applicable to DNNs ; the benefit of a tree model is the structure . Likewise , the benefit of fewer parameters is the ability for a user to simulate a decision or more easily understand the entire model . Neither of these interactions seems possible with a DTN . The authors claim that DTNs preserve the `` inherent interpretability of the tree structure , '' though the tree structure is largely lost . One of the benefits of a hard-boundary tree is that the model 's behavior over a subset of the input space can be described by a smaller ( shallower ) tree . Likewise , a single input traces a single path through the tree , so only one path per layer is relevant . For DTNs , the entire network is applicable to the entire input space . The network can not be examined for a single region or for a single input without considering the entire network . This downside of DTNs is not evaluated and is largely not addressed . -The authors aim to create an interpretable method but do not measure how interpretable their method is nor define interpretability . Additional experiments on interpretability would support the authors ' claims that their model is interpretable . -The experimental setup should be improved . The authors cite Olson et al . ( 2018 ) for their MLPs , but that work does not consider MLPs with 2 layers of 128 nodes ( i.e. , the architecture used by the authors of this work ) . In particular , an MLP with `` local '' connections ( as in DTN-S ) with depth 10 and 128 nodes per layer is similar to DTN-S and may perform better than the evaluated MLP . The way hyperparameters are selected should be made more clear to ensure that a fair comparison is made . To demonstrate the high performance of their method , the authors should compare to boosting and/or random forest approaches ( not just MLPs ) . -Table 3 does not suggest statistically significant improvements over existing methods . Questions During Rebuttal Period : Please address and clarify the `` Cons '' above . In particular : How was the MLP architecture chosen ? Minor Comments : -In the introduction , the authors note that DTs become wide as the number of layers increases , so deep trees can not be constructed . However , there exist alternative constructions which limit the width of the tree . For example , all left-children can be constrained to be leaf nodes . This is akin to the limitation of the number of nodes per layer in DTNs . -Figure 1b has the input on the right and the output on the left . The figure would be clearer if the input was on the left and the output on the right ( i.e. , flip the figure ) . Very good figure , though . -It is clear from context that DTNs have a fixed number of nodes per layer , but this should be made clearer ( as this is quite different from standard DTs and the decision transformer shown in Figure 1 ) . -The width and depth of DTNs is not clearly stated in the paper . -The ablation study could be moved to the appendix in order to make room for an evaluation of interpretability . -The paper would benefit from another editing pass for grammar .

Structurally , DTNs are similar to deep neural networks with layers of nodes operating as stochastic decision functions and which output probabilities of an input vector belonging to each sub-network . The probabilistic predictions of the decision nodes in a layer are aggregated in a `` transition matrix '' and passed to the next layer until the leaf layer is reached where the final classification decision is made . The goal of DTNs is to improve the representation power of tree models by transforming ( exponentially large ) trees to compact graphs without losing its interpretability power . The authors propose special scoring functions to explain the decisions made by each layer as well as the model . On a diverse set of datasets ranging from small ( < 1K ) to large ( > 10K ) , DTNs ( dense and sparse ) with softmax and spherical-softmax decision nodes , attained better accuracies than MLPs , conventional decision trees and their soft versions . The motivation of the work is quite clear : to improve both the representation power and the interpretability of tree structured decision trees . Unfortunately , I could not find the contribution ( s ) significant enough for ICLR . Decision nodes making probabilistic predictions is not new . There is previous work that the authors cite . The cited works are mostly for tree structured models . But there are graph structured probabilistic models with superior representation capability but may lack interpretability . It seems that DTNs just use the gain in interpretability through the proposed scoring function which seems to be weak and not generalizable . The paper is lacking in quality and clarity of presentation as well . The architecture is not well explained . There is no defined root in DTNs , rather a set of first layer nodes which acts as the root layer , yet a single root is shown in Figure 2 . Figure 2 is confusing : it is not clear what the blue nodes represent and why only certain edges are shown in bold ( b and c ) . I understood from the description of DTNs that all nodes in a layer participate in making predictions , but the figure shows otherwise . Most of the formal definitions and descriptions in section 3 are focused on decision nodes with only two branches , left and right . But the authors don \u2019 t formally and clearly state how these could be generalized to multiple branches when formally introducing DTNs in section 4 and in experiments . One of the claimed contributions in the paper is the theoretical analysis of interpretability of DTNs ( theorem 1 ) . First , the notations used in the theorem are not defined , for example x_k , \\pi_ { lj } , v_1 ( x ) etc . Next , how does one interpret the score for a layer and for a decision . How does the score help to derive any meaningful explanations for a prediction ? There were no experiments done to support this scoring function . The experiment on clustering is something obvious and does n't show the benefit of using DTNs . Besides it is mentioned that the proposed scoring function does not apply to non-linear activation functions . It seems that this scoring function is weak as it will not work for other models that DTNs can be generalized to . The question of how to train these models were completely omitted . The authors only mentioned the activation functions used in nodes . I could not find any details on the architecture or any statistics on the size of these networks .

Each layer is then modelled as a stochastic decision ( multiplication by a stochastic matrix ) which can mimic the behaviour of both standard decision tree and stochastic trees ( among others ) . Their idea is to keep the layer decomposition as it is to be able to understand/interpret each layer as pieces of the bigger picture ( i.e. , the interpretation of the model itself ) . Overal comment : The approach is well motivated ( comment ( a ) ) and the paper is well-written . The most interesting feature of the proposed approach is the generalisation / unified view of several decision tree algorithms that may appear as completely different and but comes down to a mere choice of a type of decision function ( kind of layers ) in the proposed approach ( similarly to what typically happens when building a neural network ) . On the other hand , this work is focused on mimicking the deep learning framework while neglecting a bit the tree-based learning framework ( comments ( b ) , ( c ) ) . Some practical details ( comment ( f ) ) or some explanation are however missing for in-depth understanding of the results ( comments ( c ) , ( d ) , ( e ) , ( f ) ) . Therefore , I think the paper could be accepted for the generalisation of existing approaches , the improvement of prediction accuracy ( comment ( d ) ) but the interpretability is somehow limited ( comment ( e ) ) despite a strong motivation regarding the interpretability of the proposed approach ( comment ( a ) ) . Major comments : ( a ) The motivation of focusing on the interpretability of combined tree-based and deep neural networks models is very good as these methods were most likely designed to improve the raw performances without considering the loss of interpretability . ( b ) To which extent your method relates with the tree-based learning framework ? In particular , you said that `` the transition matrices of a decision transformer [ ... ] can be collapsed to form a single transition matrix '' . I totally agree that for the sake of interpretability you suggest not to consider the model as a single transition matrix but mathematically it can be rewritten as such . Therefore , how does it relates to kernel-based formulation of decision trees models ? ( c ) It is unclear to me how is defined a `` contribution of x_k '' . There is a large amount of working focusing on the measuring feature contributions from tree-based models . Similarly to ( b ) , how your work relates to this ? ( d ) Table 3 shows impressive results . However , it would have been interesting ( maybe not better but informative at least ) on the number of wins/ties/loss of your model ( say the best one ) wrt to the others . Indeed , given the standard deviations and the mean over many differents problems , it is not clear if your approach is always better or only partially . ( e ) I see the point of Figure 3 as showing the evolution of the decision map moving from not well separated samples to easily separable classes . However , the definition of `` random clusters '' ( at the root layer for instance ) is not clear as the problem is defined with three classes , I believe that at layer 0 you do not look where samples end and therefore have not idea on the predicted class ( hence explaining the `` new '' colours ) . It is also surprising to consider `` two '' clusters at layer 0 , then `` four colours '' at layer 15 while finishing with 3 . Please clarify . ( f ) It would have been interesting to have more details on the practical details on the learning of your models ( time , implementations , ... ) .", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Thank you for the positive review . ( b ) Our work relates to previous tree models in that a DTN can generalize any tree model by adopting a proper transition function at each layer , even though it uses a complex kernel function at each decision . ( c ) The contribution of a feature element , i.e. , the importance of the feature for a decision , is evaluated by an interpretability score . ( d ) Following the general observation that there is no single machine learning model that outperforms all others in every data , we observe DTNs do not outperform previous models in some data sets . This just shows that we have tried datasets with various properties and sizes . ( e ) We set the number of nodes to 4 , which means that each layer divides given examples into four clusters , except for the leaf nodes that classify each example into one of the three classes . The root node uses only two clusters while it has four . We can guess that model uses fewer clusters than the actual number of classes due to the low complexity of the dataset ."}], "0": {"review_id": "c5klJN-Bpq1-0", "review_text": "Update : I have read the author 's response and decided to keep my review , confidence , and score . - Summary : this paper generalizes existing decision trees to some neural-style model .

The training was done to minimize the cross-entropy loss of classification problems ."}, "3": {"review_id": "c5klJN-Bpq1-3", "review_text": "Summary : The authors propose a new model that consists in transforming decision trees by seeing such models as a sequence of `` layers '' made of all nodes at the same tree depth . Each layer is then modelled as a stochastic decision ( multiplication by a stochastic matrix ) which can mimic the behaviour of both standard decision tree and stochastic trees ( among others ) . Their idea is to keep the layer decomposition as it is to be able to understand/interpret each layer as pieces of the bigger picture ( i.e. , the interpretation of the model itself ) . Overal comment : The approach is well motivated ( comment ( a ) ) and the paper is well-written . The most interesting feature of the proposed approach is the generalisation / unified view of several decision tree algorithms that may appear as completely different and but comes down to a mere choice of a type of decision function ( kind of layers ) in the proposed approach ( similarly to what typically happens when building a neural network ) . On the other hand , this work is focused on mimicking the deep learning framework while neglecting a bit the tree-based learning framework ( comments ( b ) , ( c ) ) . Some practical details ( comment ( f ) ) or some explanation are however missing for in-depth understanding of the results ( comments ( c ) , ( d ) , ( e ) , ( f ) ) . Therefore , I think the paper could be accepted for the generalisation of existing approaches , the improvement of prediction accuracy ( comment ( d ) ) but the interpretability is somehow limited ( comment ( e ) ) despite a strong motivation regarding the interpretability of the proposed approach ( comment ( a ) ) . Major comments : ( a ) The motivation of focusing on the interpretability of combined tree-based and deep neural networks models is very good as these methods were most likely designed to improve the raw performances without considering the loss of interpretability . ( b ) To which extent your method relates with the tree-based learning framework ? In particular , you said that `` the transition matrices of a decision transformer [ ... ] can be collapsed to form a single transition matrix '' . I totally agree that for the sake of interpretability you suggest not to consider the model as a single transition matrix but mathematically it can be rewritten as such . Therefore , how does it relates to kernel-based formulation of decision trees models ? ( c ) It is unclear to me how is defined a `` contribution of x_k '' . There is a large amount of working focusing on the measuring feature contributions from tree-based models . Similarly to ( b ) , how your work relates to this ? ( d ) Table 3 shows impressive results . However , it would have been interesting ( maybe not better but informative at least ) on the number of wins/ties/loss of your model ( say the best one ) wrt to the others . Indeed , given the standard deviations and the mean over many differents problems , it is not clear if your approach is always better or only partially . ( e ) I see the point of Figure 3 as showing the evolution of the decision map moving from not well separated samples to easily separable classes . However , the definition of `` random clusters '' ( at the root layer for instance ) is not clear as the problem is defined with three classes , I believe that at layer 0 you do not look where samples end and therefore have not idea on the predicted class ( hence explaining the `` new '' colours ) . It is also surprising to consider `` two '' clusters at layer 0 , then `` four colours '' at layer 15 while finishing with 3 . Please clarify . ( f ) It would have been interesting to have more details on the practical details on the learning of your models ( time , implementations , ... ) .", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Thank you for the positive review . ( b ) Our work relates to previous tree models in that a DTN can generalize any tree model by adopting a proper transition function at each layer , even though it uses a complex kernel function at each decision . ( c ) The contribution of a feature element , i.e. , the importance of the feature for a decision , is evaluated by an interpretability score . ( d ) Following the general observation that there is no single machine learning model that outperforms all others in every data , we observe DTNs do not outperform previous models in some data sets . This just shows that we have tried datasets with various properties and sizes . ( e ) We set the number of nodes to 4 , which means that each layer divides given examples into four clusters , except for the leaf nodes that classify each example into one of the three classes . The root node uses only two clusters while it has four . We can guess that model uses fewer clusters than the actual number of classes due to the low complexity of the dataset ."}}
