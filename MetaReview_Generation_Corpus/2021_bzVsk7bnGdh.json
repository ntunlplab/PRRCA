I don't think we need to put every single minor fact into a ICLR submission.  For example, one can just compute the integral as an alternative by any suitable quadrature rule.

Namely , the authors claim that for the variety of applications , NFEs at backward pass can be reduced if the automated step selection will be based only on the part of the information of the adjoint state . Strong points - The paper is clearly written . The performance of the proposed method is evaluated for a wide variety of tasks ( time series , generative modeling , physical control ) . Hyperparameter setups are provided to reproduce the experiments . Weak points -- The paper does n't provide a comparison with the existing techniques for speeding up NFEs ( e.g. , Finlay et al . ( 2020 ) ) .The paper claims that the proposed approach is complementary to the techniques mentioned in the related paper . However , I have n't found supportive experiments for this assumption . If I understood correctly , the authors use weight decay everywhere in their experiments . Therefore , I wonder if the proposed method shows similar behavior when weight decay is omitted . Recommendation ( accept or reject ) - For this moment , I 'd recommend rejecting the paper due to the mentioned weak points ; however , I consider updating the decision if weak points and questions will be closed during the rebuttal period . Update : Thanks to the authors for the work done during the rebuttal period . The proposed method seems working but it 's still not very clear when it is beneficial to use it .

Describing Symplectic ODE-Net results in Table 3 , the authors claim that the loss is almost the same for default norm/seminorm training .

We agree that the claim that techniques may be complementary is unsubstantiated and have removed it from the paper . We agree that further experiments ( comparisons to other techniques , varying the amount of weight decay ) could be performed . We believed that this was unnecessary as the existing experiments already demonstrate that our technique already has a large ( ~40 % ) direct benefit , with no observed downsides . - However , we have now introduced additional experiments in response to queries by both this reviewer and Reviewer 1 , seeking to better explain the source of the improvements when using seminorms .

The paper has good theoretical insights , however I agree with the other reviewers that more completeness is required to make the proposal stronger . -- Summary The paper recognizes that the error calculations in Neural ODEs involve some terms that don \u2019 t need to be accounted for . It then shows that by ignoring those terms , the number of function evaluations reduces while approximately maintaining accuracy . The paper demonstrates this in 3 tasks - speech classification using Neural CDEs , generative modeling using FFJORD , and Hamiltonian dynamics using Symplectic ODE-Net . Strengths The paper is well written , the motivation is clearly explained . There is a diverse set of tasks that are tackled , which is great to check for consistency of the conclusions drawn . A code snippet is provided for one implementation to show how simple the proposed change is to incorporate into existing code . Where possible , helpful graphs have been provided to help visualize the conclusions of the respective experiments . The paper also mentions other works and how this work is not closely related to them . Comments Different aspects of introducing the paper \u2019 s contribution are explored only in one task , and not all . For example , the graph of the Backward NFE vs Epoch is showcased for the 1st task of speech classification , but not the rest of the tasks . It would be important to understand if the conclusion that the semi-norm has better NFE throughout training is consistent in all the tasks explored . For example , the proposed change does not seem to be very effective in the task of generative modelling in terms of BPD , hence it would be important to understand how the proposed change affects training in that task . This also holds for locations of rejection steps , as it was mentioned that although intuitively the spurious steps closer to T=0 would be rejected but empirically it holds true for all t , but this aspect is only explored in the 3rd task . It would be important to understand how consistent this is across tasks . Overall , the paper seems to introduce a minor change that only works on simpler tasks but does not affect higher-dimensional tasks such as generative modeling very effectively . This is probably because the underlying dynamics for the generative modeling tasks are necessarily complex . Works such as Finlay et al ( 2020 ) and Ghosh et al ( 2020 ) ( uncited in the paper ! ) propose to reduce the complexity of the underlying dynamics . It is pertinent to see how this paper \u2019 s proposed change affects the training of those models . Hopefully , the simpler dynamics should implicitly lend to smaller NFEs , which the proposed change can take advantage of and show faster results on . It is important to note that terms such as \u201c standard \u201d may not apply to Neural ODEs , since they are hardly 2 years old and so are quite nascent and yet to be widely adopted . The fact that some papers that work on Neural ODEs are not as cited or implemented in software packages as others does not mean they are not \u201c standard \u201d ( or any such related term ) , and vice-versa . The \u201c 12 lines of code \u201d contribution also only works for the \u201c standard \u201d implementation . This is not a weakness per se , but software-related changes are highly subject to the respective software being used . Something that \u2019 s 12 lines in one particular code repository implemented in PyTorch may be a lot more lines in a different implementation or in a different language such as Julia or Jax .

Apologies for the delay in responding -- we were performing follow-up experiments ( discussed below ) in response to these reviews . The reviewer notes that different topics are only explored with different tasks .

But for completeness : the behaviour was indeed consistent across every task . The reviewer 's other main criticism seems to be that the topic of the paper is a `` minor change that only works on simpler tasks '' . First , we quite firmly that a paper 's contribution should be proportional to its efficacy -- in our case , median 40 % improvement , with no observed downsides -- not to the complexity of its ideas .

We are very pleased that they describe the paper as `` beautifully organised '' and `` extremely clear '' . ( If only every paper was described that way . ) Regarding the other questions : - We have now introduced an additional set of experiments investigating the source of the improvement , such as the smaller improvement for CNFs . This is given in the new Section 3.4 . We see that the difference between problems is roughly attributable to the ratio between the number of parameters and the size of the state . This corresponds to the the reduction in rejection-causing channels on the adjoint pass . For example , CNF models have large state but ( relatively ) few parameters , whilst the other experiments have small state but many parameters . It was for this reason that we performed ablation studies with CNF models that are larger than the standard used in previous works . This not only led to a larger gap in NFE between the standard norm and our seminorm , but also to an improvement from the original FFJORD paper 's 3.35- > 3.34 and 0.99- > 0.95 for CIFAR10 and MNIST respectively . These numbers can be contrasted with the explicit regularisation of Finlay et al.2020 , which are 3.38 and 0.97 . Their regularisation performs worse than vanilla CNF on CIFAR10 whilst our method is simpler to implement , does not introduce additional computational cost , and does not hinder performance at all . - Comparisons to other ODE solvers would be a good fit ; indeed we expect that our contribution should readily be applicable to any solver scheme that can solve z reliably . However given the ubiquity of Dormand -- Prince amongst adaptive solvers , this was simply judged to be less important than the other experiments already present in the paper , such as validating the technique across a wide range of domains . - On deriving a theoretical description : we are not aware of a theory for analysing the expected number of steps of an adaptive step-size ODE solver ; every comparison we are aware of is empirical . If the reviewer is familiar with a literature on this topic we would be grateful to know more . ( But otherwise of course we can not update the paper to discuss what does not exist . ) * * Summary * * Thankyou again for your review . We hope that this rebuttal , and the additional experiments , have offset the reviewer 's concerns . We would welcome further discussion towards improving their score ."}}
