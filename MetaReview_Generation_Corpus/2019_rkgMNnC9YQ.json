They extend this idea by considering how a human with domain knowledge might have different expectations for the observer. The authors test this framework on a multi-variate time series medical data (MIMIC-III) to show that, under their formulation, the external observer can learn interpretable embeddings. Pros: - Interesting approach: Trying to develop an external observer based on information theoretic perspective. - Considering the domain knowledge of the human subject can potentially be an important element when we want to use interpretable models in practice. Issues: (1) In 2.4: So between M and M^O, which one is a member of M_reg? (2) On a related note to issue (1): In 2.4.1, \"Clearly, for each i, (M(X))_i | M^O(X) follows also a Gaussian distribution: First of all, I'm not sure if that expression is supposed to be p(M(X)_i | M^O(X)) or if that was intended. But either way, I don't understand why that would follow a normal distribution. Can you clarify this along with issue (1)? (3) In 2.4.2: The rationale behind using attention & compactness to estimate the complexity of M^O is weak. Can you elaborate this in the future version? (4) What do each figure in Figure 4 represent? (5) More of a philosophical question: the authors train M and M^O together, but it seems more appropriate to train an external observer separately. If we are going to propose a framework to train an agent that tries to explain a black box function, then training the black-box function together with the observer can be seen as cheating. It can potentially make the job of the observer easier by training the black box function to be easily explainable. It would have been okay if this was discussed in the paper, but I can't find such discussion. (6) The experiments can be made much stronger by applying this approach to a specific prediction task such as mortality prediction. The current auto-encoding task doesn't seem very interesting to apply interpretation. (7) Most importantly: I like the idea very much, but the paper clearly needs more work. There are broken citations and typos everywhere. I strongly suggest polishing this paper as it could be an important work in the model interpretability field.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "reply_text": "We have attempted to address your comments in the following way . Regarding issue ( 1 ) above , we have added text in 2.4 to address your valid concern . It turns out that for the MDL , we are really interested in M^o . However , the regression restriction is really dictated by the problem that we are trying to solve . Both M and M^o belong to M_reg . Regarding ( 2 ) , there was a typo that we fixed as you pointed ( missing `` p '' ) . Regarding the gaussian assumption , this is pretty standard when trying to model the distribution of a regression error . It is a standard assumption for which we added a pointer in the paper to a text book on MDL . Regarding 3 , compactness simply relates to description lengths . A more compact model will require less bits to be described . As stated in the paper , the MDL does not really mandate how the model complexity should be computed . Attention models have been suggested for explainability in the literature . We are expanding on these approaches . More complex models can certainly be looked and we plan to do this in the future . Regarding 5 , the gist of this work is to develop metrics of explainability to : ( i ) be able to estimate or measure how explainable deep learning models are and ( ii ) to be able to force the learning of deep models towards models that are easy to explain . For ( i ) , training an external observer separately makes sense . We could have reported results experimental results on this since the code that we have does it implicitly to estimate these metrics during the learning . Our focus in the paper is mostly on ( ii ) , a harder problem in our view . We do not view this joint learning as `` cheating '' ( it could just be a poor choice of words ) . We are only trying to enforce explainability constraints on the training of architectures like RNNs that are notoriously hard to explain . The joint learning with the observer allows us to do just that . There is a delicate balance between the expressiveness of the model M and explainability enforced by the observer M^o . If the black box is too easy to explain , it will not perform well on its task . Similarly , if the backbox is very complex , it will not be easy to explain . The joint learning helps us trade between these extremes , as shown by the experiments where we vary the hyper-parameters controlling this trade-off . There is a discussion on this trade-off in the experimental section . Regarding 6 , we agree that this approach can be applied on other deep learning tasks . We have decided to use this embedding problem in this paper simply because applications of deep learning techniques to these problems in healthcare is hindered by explainability requirements . We definitely plan on applying the framework on other problems in the future . Regarding 7 , we do agree and have taken multiple passes at it to address these issues . Finally , we removed Figure 4 .
