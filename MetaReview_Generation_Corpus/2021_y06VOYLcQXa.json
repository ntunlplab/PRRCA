A VAE-LP model first reconstructs a coarse image from side channel information which is reshaped and processed using a convolutional network . The output of the VAE-LP model is refined using a GAN to add fine details . Compelling results are demonstrated for recovery of private information and state of art metrics are reported . # # # # Strengths : 1 . The paper is well written with great attention to detail . All design decisions are well motivated and have been adequately explained . 2.State of the art qualitative results are demonstrated for recovery of images using SCA . 3.The paper is an extremely interesting application of the VAE-GAN framework . 4.The proposed solution offers a way to recover private information without requiring specialized knowledge of the system architecture , which is a great advantage as it is potentially generalizable to a wide variety of architectures . 5.To the best of the reviewer 's knowledge , the treatment of related work is adequate and the positioning of the current work in the context of prior art is made very clear . 6.Analysis is performed on a wide variety of datasets indicating that the solution is not over-engineered to a particular library or architecture . 7.The appendix presents a lot of interesting experiments and analysis . Particularly , classification performance and recovery quality on images trained using a more generic rather than domain specific dataset . # # # # Weaknesses : 1 . Although the authors mention that direct comparisons are hard to provide to previous methods due to lack of public implementation . Few qualitative examples of recovered images from prior art ( relegated to the appendix ) would help motivate the need for the proposed approach better . 2.It is not clear why the L1 loss is necessary for the second stage in section 3.3 . Particularly , as opposed to a more well studied framework like Pix2pix [ 1 ] , which imposes a L1 loss at the output with a ground truth image . Because at training time we know the GT image that we are recovering . An ablation study demonstrating the quality without this L1 loss would be insightful . 3.Reporting image level metrics is instructive in understanding how far the reconstructed image is from the ground truth image . Particularly , SSIM and LPIPS [ 2 ] score of generated image w.r.t ground truth image . 4.Although the formulation is interesting . The novelty is somewhat limited as it is straightforward application of the VAE-GAN framework to SCA data . # # # # Questions : 1 . The exact nature of the trace encoding is unclear . Are memory locations fed directly into the network ? If so how are the normalized , because assuming 16 bit addresses , the range of values occupied 2 . The authors mention that libraries like libjpeg generates 700k side channel `` signals '' in Section 1 . What is the nature of these signals ? Particularly are the single bits of information/ text/ memory locations ? 3.Although beyond the scope of the presented work , this framework allows for access of private information . Such methods raise obvious ethical concerns on part of services which offer ML solution . A small statement about how this form of attack can be protected against would be instructive in strengthening the narrative . 4.The motivation to use a CNN to process trace matrix is unclear . Particularly , are assumptions of equivariance made on the access patterns ? Apart from the architectural convenience of weight sharing is there a stronger motivation to assume a convolutional structure on the input ? An MLP ( or 1 * 1 conv ) with pooling run on the same $ $ N \\times N \\times K $ $ encoded trace matrix would provided some insights regarding the need for a CNN to process the trace information . 5.It is not clear what the generated * Dec * refers to in Sec.3.2. # # # # Minor : subsumed - > assumed ? in section 3.2 # # # # Justification of rating : Although the authors present an interesting application of the VAE-GAN framework for recovery of private information from SCA , the formulation of the problem is remarkably similar to conditional-VAE . It would be interesting to further analyze the learnt representation from the VAE-LP to see if certain `` code-blocks '' or functions can be isolated . Having said that , the paper is very well written and thorough in its analysis . The reviewer also believes that a systems/privacy audience would be able to appreciate the contributions of this work better . # # # # Updates In light of the responses provided by the authors , and the thorough nature of the additional experiments I am inclined to increase the ratings of this paper .

This new framework consists of two submodels : the VAE-LP model generates a coarse reconstruction image and the GAN model refines this reconstruction . The experiments show good results in reconstruction . The idea of reconstructing images from system side channels is interesting and the proposed approach shows good performance . I have the following concerns about the publication of this paper : 1 . The novelty is limited from the perspective of the method . The VAE with learned prior is new but little discussion is provided that why a learned prior is necessary . Can we just use a simple supervised end-to-end autoencoder to learn the mapping from side channel signals to the image ? Can we use a standard VAE without the Image Encoder branch ? Btw , these two are the important baseline for comparison . The authors need to explain why such a design is necessary , or better . Is this a framework specifically designed for SCA , or is it suitable for any task of image reconstruction from any signals ? 2.The motivation of the GAN submodel is confusing . As shown in Figure.3 , the results of VAE-LP are blurry and are difficult to identify the details , which is reasonable as the input may include very limited information . The GAN submodel adds a lot of details to these images . Some of them are far from the reference images , which is also reasonable as GAN tends to add * * texture-like noises * * . The refinement or the rich structures and textures are made-up by GAN for good * * visual effects * * . This additional information is not guaranteed to be correct . Usually , GAN is applied where we require good visual effects . Do we need this in SCA , even more important than the accuracy of the results ? 3.The GAN submodel also faces the challenge of * * model collapse * * , which refers to the problem that the network tends to generate limited patterns to fool the discriminator . As the training dataset is highly structured and the patterns are relatively simple . Is the proposed method capable of working in the scenario of reconstructing natural images ? Is the risk of model collapse a concern for the SCA task ? This discussion deserves to be included in the paper . 4.Another question that may attract the attention of the machine learning field is , can we know what information in the side channel is used for image reconstruction ? In the paper , the side channel information is folded into 2D matrix because of the spatial dependency . Can we visualize this dependency ? Is it robust to noise or shifting ?

Why an image encoder ? Images synthesized without using the image encoder are seen as low quality this is reasonable because the input is merely the matrix derived from the side channel traces . 2.Why a learned prior ? When feeding the decoder with a fixed gaussian prior , the synthesized images are seen as low quality as well . Overall , the outputs become not recognizable since the fixed prior has no information of side channel traces . This also indicates that our model is not a simple image generator , and the trace encoder plays a vital role in the pipeline . 3.Why both ? As we mentioned in the paper , by incorporating the side channel trace encoder , we can extract latent representations from the logged side channel signals . Simultaneously , by integrating corresponding reference images during training , we provide a guideline to help the image decoder to generate quality images . We will extend the paper to clarify this design decision and avoid confusions . Kindly advise us if further empirical results regarding this matter is needed .

While this was previously known , in this paper , the authors use machine learning techniques to more efficiently `` learn '' how to use this side-channel information , developing generative models that allow image reconstruction . Strong Points : 1 ) The use of machine learning techniques as an `` attack methodology '' for making use of side channel information seems to be a potentially powerful methodology . 2 ) The results shown here seem quite strong . 3 ) The application ( image analysis ) is well chosen ; the side channels under consideration seems quite plausible . 4 ) The code is made available . Weak Points : 1 ) There are obvious counters to this approach ; once one knows that this type of software is being targeted , one can introduce various randomization ( for memory accesses , timing , etc . ) to lessen the power of side channel attacks . That is , this may only be a reasonable attack because nobody has to this point considered it important to avoid side channel information being released by image analysis software . 2 ) It 's a little unclear ( to this reviewer ) how much `` information '' the learning algorithm is seeded with . That is , for these image sets , how similar/distinct are the underlying images ? Your examples seem to capture a lot of the original image , but it 's not clear to me how to interpret what the algorithm is starting with . ( Essentially , would these results scale to much larger sets of images ? How much does working with the limited set of celebrity faces already help yield the strong results ? This is tackled somewhat in Appendix F , so the authors do seem aware of this point . ) 3 ) It seems like you 're considering all the different side channels separately ? Is there any way to combine the multiple side channels ( into a mega-side-channel ? ) and do better ? ( I apologize if I 'm missing something -- I 'd expect to see a result set with each side information , as you 've given , but then results with all combined . ) 4 ) This reviewer does not have good insight into why this type of side information would be useful in determining how to reconstruct images in the manner done here . Some description or intuition as to how accessed cache lines could intuitively be used to determine an approximation to the original picture would be welcome . ( Understood you have limited space . ) 5 ) The paper does seem like a first step and there remains significant room for improvement ( improved side channels , improved scalability , other applications ) . Overall Rating : Despite the ( relatively minor ) weak points , the paper seems to be a strong proof of concept that machine learning can greatly increase the risk of side channel attacks , because they can essentially automate the task of determining how to use the side channel information to obtain the desired result . This seems to be an important message for the community , in particular as I expect this framework is not specific to image analysis software , but can be applied more generally . Questions for Authors : I would very much like to see some sort of experiment where noise is injected in the side channel information . One can view this as a setting where one obtains limited side channel information for some reason , or as a setting where the program is modified in some way to lessen the amount/value of side information . Similarly , as discussed above , is there some intuition as to why the side information yields such reasonable results ? ( Again , and how this relates to the limited data sets ? ) And whether or not you could combine multiple types of side information naturally using this approach ?

We believe combining multiple side channels is technically feasible . On the other hand , it seems not aligned with how typical SCA is launched in the real-world scenarios . Overall , we have evaluated three side channels in the paper : - Cache based side channel : denoting a commonly used attack scenario where attackers share the same cache unit with the victim software . - Page table side channel : denoting another common scenario where attackers can monitor the OS page table access pattern . - Read/write side channel : this side channel was considered to be less informative . However , we , * for the first time * , show that quality images can be synthesized from this side channel . Such findings reveal the strength of our approach . Typically , if an attacker can only use page table side channels , it indicates that he is * not * capable of using cache line-based side channel which is indeed finer-grained and more informative .

Overall , the images recovered when using mini-Imagenet as the training data are visually worse than images recovered using specialized datasets . We consider this evaluation faithfully reveals the full potential and * trade-off * of our research . This also helps to avoid any over-claim or misleading of the results . We also want to clarify that when training the model on mini-ImagNet , we put images from different classes together and * * provide no information of the class label * * , which is very challenging and is different from the existing methods of training generative models on this kind of dataset . * * Will the organization of the matrix influence the results ? * * Thank you for the question . We currently use a straightforward setting by simply dividing a trace into K segments of equal length ; N adjacent points in a segment are put into one row , in total N rows . This setting is independent from the victim program \u2019 s structure . We believe the matrix organization does not influence the model structure , since overall , the side channel traces are very sparse . In the past few days , we also launched experiences to add noise on the trace or round shift the trace , results are still highly promising . * * Please refer to our response to ` Is it robust to noise or shifting ? ` to Reviewer # 2 . * * * * What if there are random zero paddings or other errors in the log ? * * Thank you for the question .

For our scenario , side channel attacks could be mitigated through software-level or system-level methods . For instance , the victim software might be rewritten into an \u201c input-independent \u201d memory access pattern , thus side channel traces can not be used to recover any meaningful inputs . However , it is typically not adopted given the extra performance slowdown it can incur . In addition , our work can also be used as a bug detector to help developers detect and isolate software code blocks and functions that have the risk of private leakage , not merely attacking the target software ( * * please refer to our response to ` what information in the side channel is used for image reconstruction ` to Review # 2 * * ) . Overall , we will extend the paper in the revision and add discussions on the possible mitigation of our attacks . We will definitely take ethics issues into consideration in the revision .

A VAE-LP model first reconstructs a coarse image from side channel information which is reshaped and processed using a convolutional network . The output of the VAE-LP model is refined using a GAN to add fine details . Compelling results are demonstrated for recovery of private information and state of art metrics are reported . # # # # Strengths : 1 . The paper is well written with great attention to detail . All design decisions are well motivated and have been adequately explained . 2.State of the art qualitative results are demonstrated for recovery of images using SCA . 3.The paper is an extremely interesting application of the VAE-GAN framework . 4.The proposed solution offers a way to recover private information without requiring specialized knowledge of the system architecture , which is a great advantage as it is potentially generalizable to a wide variety of architectures . 5.To the best of the reviewer 's knowledge , the treatment of related work is adequate and the positioning of the current work in the context of prior art is made very clear . 6.Analysis is performed on a wide variety of datasets indicating that the solution is not over-engineered to a particular library or architecture . 7.The appendix presents a lot of interesting experiments and analysis . Particularly , classification performance and recovery quality on images trained using a more generic rather than domain specific dataset . # # # # Weaknesses : 1 . Although the authors mention that direct comparisons are hard to provide to previous methods due to lack of public implementation . Few qualitative examples of recovered images from prior art ( relegated to the appendix ) would help motivate the need for the proposed approach better . 2.It is not clear why the L1 loss is necessary for the second stage in section 3.3 . Particularly , as opposed to a more well studied framework like Pix2pix [ 1 ] , which imposes a L1 loss at the output with a ground truth image . Because at training time we know the GT image that we are recovering . An ablation study demonstrating the quality without this L1 loss would be insightful . 3.Reporting image level metrics is instructive in understanding how far the reconstructed image is from the ground truth image . Particularly , SSIM and LPIPS [ 2 ] score of generated image w.r.t ground truth image . 4.Although the formulation is interesting . The novelty is somewhat limited as it is straightforward application of the VAE-GAN framework to SCA data . # # # # Questions : 1 . The exact nature of the trace encoding is unclear . Are memory locations fed directly into the network ? If so how are the normalized , because assuming 16 bit addresses , the range of values occupied 2 . The authors mention that libraries like libjpeg generates 700k side channel `` signals '' in Section 1 . What is the nature of these signals ? Particularly are the single bits of information/ text/ memory locations ? 3.Although beyond the scope of the presented work , this framework allows for access of private information . Such methods raise obvious ethical concerns on part of services which offer ML solution . A small statement about how this form of attack can be protected against would be instructive in strengthening the narrative . 4.The motivation to use a CNN to process trace matrix is unclear . Particularly , are assumptions of equivariance made on the access patterns ? Apart from the architectural convenience of weight sharing is there a stronger motivation to assume a convolutional structure on the input ? An MLP ( or 1 * 1 conv ) with pooling run on the same $ $ N \\times N \\times K $ $ encoded trace matrix would provided some insights regarding the need for a CNN to process the trace information . 5.It is not clear what the generated * Dec * refers to in Sec.3.2. # # # # Minor : subsumed - > assumed ? in section 3.2 # # # # Justification of rating : Although the authors present an interesting application of the VAE-GAN framework for recovery of private information from SCA , the formulation of the problem is remarkably similar to conditional-VAE . It would be interesting to further analyze the learnt representation from the VAE-LP to see if certain `` code-blocks '' or functions can be isolated . Having said that , the paper is very well written and thorough in its analysis . The reviewer also believes that a systems/privacy audience would be able to appreciate the contributions of this work better . # # # # Updates In light of the responses provided by the authors , and the thorough nature of the additional experiments I am inclined to increase the ratings of this paper . The followup responses answer most concerns raised by reviewers and provide supporting evidence . However , the reviewer maintains that this work could potentially be of more interest to a privacy audience who may better be able to appreciate the use case considered in the presented work .

It \u2019 s reasonable since we did NOT train the model with perceptual loss . Overall , we wish to clarify that the purpose of SCA is to precisely reconstruct the ground truth image .

This new framework consists of two submodels : the VAE-LP model generates a coarse reconstruction image and the GAN model refines this reconstruction . The experiments show good results in reconstruction . The idea of reconstructing images from system side channels is interesting and the proposed approach shows good performance . I have the following concerns about the publication of this paper : 1 . The novelty is limited from the perspective of the method . The VAE with learned prior is new but little discussion is provided that why a learned prior is necessary . Can we just use a simple supervised end-to-end autoencoder to learn the mapping from side channel signals to the image ? Can we use a standard VAE without the Image Encoder branch ? Btw , these two are the important baseline for comparison . The authors need to explain why such a design is necessary , or better . Is this a framework specifically designed for SCA , or is it suitable for any task of image reconstruction from any signals ? 2.The motivation of the GAN submodel is confusing . As shown in Figure.3 , the results of VAE-LP are blurry and are difficult to identify the details , which is reasonable as the input may include very limited information . The GAN submodel adds a lot of details to these images . Some of them are far from the reference images , which is also reasonable as GAN tends to add * * texture-like noises * * . The refinement or the rich structures and textures are made-up by GAN for good * * visual effects * * . This additional information is not guaranteed to be correct . Usually , GAN is applied where we require good visual effects . Do we need this in SCA , even more important than the accuracy of the results ? 3.The GAN submodel also faces the challenge of * * model collapse * * , which refers to the problem that the network tends to generate limited patterns to fool the discriminator . As the training dataset is highly structured and the patterns are relatively simple . Is the proposed method capable of working in the scenario of reconstructing natural images ? Is the risk of model collapse a concern for the SCA task ? This discussion deserves to be included in the paper . 4.Another question that may attract the attention of the machine learning field is , can we know what information in the side channel is used for image reconstruction ? In the paper , the side channel information is folded into 2D matrix because of the spatial dependency . Can we visualize this dependency ? Is it robust to noise or shifting ?

We present the synthesized images in the updated Appendix ( * Page 26 * ) of our paper . Regarding the newly added images on Page 26 , we wish to further clarify the following aspects : 1 . Why an image encoder ? Images synthesized without using the image encoder are seen as low quality this is reasonable because the input is merely the matrix derived from the side channel traces . 2.Why a learned prior ? When feeding the decoder with a fixed gaussian prior , the synthesized images are seen as low quality as well . Overall , the outputs become not recognizable since the fixed prior has no information of side channel traces . This also indicates that our model is not a simple image generator , and the trace encoder plays a vital role in the pipeline . 3.Why both ? As we mentioned in the paper , by incorporating the side channel trace encoder , we can extract latent representations from the logged side channel signals . Simultaneously , by integrating corresponding reference images during training , we provide a guideline to help the image decoder to generate quality images . We will extend the paper to clarify this design decision and avoid confusions . Kindly advise us if further empirical results regarding this matter is needed .

While this was previously known , in this paper , the authors use machine learning techniques to more efficiently `` learn '' how to use this side-channel information , developing generative models that allow image reconstruction . Strong Points : 1 ) The use of machine learning techniques as an `` attack methodology '' for making use of side channel information seems to be a potentially powerful methodology . 2 ) The results shown here seem quite strong . 3 ) The application ( image analysis ) is well chosen ; the side channels under consideration seems quite plausible . 4 ) The code is made available . Weak Points : 1 ) There are obvious counters to this approach ; once one knows that this type of software is being targeted , one can introduce various randomization ( for memory accesses , timing , etc . ) to lessen the power of side channel attacks . That is , this may only be a reasonable attack because nobody has to this point considered it important to avoid side channel information being released by image analysis software . 2 ) It 's a little unclear ( to this reviewer ) how much `` information '' the learning algorithm is seeded with . That is , for these image sets , how similar/distinct are the underlying images ? Your examples seem to capture a lot of the original image , but it 's not clear to me how to interpret what the algorithm is starting with . ( Essentially , would these results scale to much larger sets of images ? How much does working with the limited set of celebrity faces already help yield the strong results ? This is tackled somewhat in Appendix F , so the authors do seem aware of this point . ) 3 ) It seems like you 're considering all the different side channels separately ? Is there any way to combine the multiple side channels ( into a mega-side-channel ? ) and do better ? ( I apologize if I 'm missing something -- I 'd expect to see a result set with each side information , as you 've given , but then results with all combined . ) 4 ) This reviewer does not have good insight into why this type of side information would be useful in determining how to reconstruct images in the manner done here . Some description or intuition as to how accessed cache lines could intuitively be used to determine an approximation to the original picture would be welcome . ( Understood you have limited space . ) 5 ) The paper does seem like a first step and there remains significant room for improvement ( improved side channels , improved scalability , other applications ) . Overall Rating : Despite the ( relatively minor ) weak points , the paper seems to be a strong proof of concept that machine learning can greatly increase the risk of side channel attacks , because they can essentially automate the task of determining how to use the side channel information to obtain the desired result . This seems to be an important message for the community , in particular as I expect this framework is not specific to image analysis software , but can be applied more generally . Questions for Authors : I would very much like to see some sort of experiment where noise is injected in the side channel information . One can view this as a setting where one obtains limited side channel information for some reason , or as a setting where the program is modified in some way to lessen the amount/value of side information . Similarly , as discussed above , is there some intuition as to why the side information yields such reasonable results ? ( Again , and how this relates to the limited data sets ? ) And whether or not you could combine multiple types of side information naturally using this approach ? Other Feedback : Overall thee paper seems well written , and you do provide a great deal of data .", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "reply_text": "Thank you for your efforts reviewing our paper and providing helpful comments and suggestions .

Overall , we have seen a number of papers that propose methods to mitigate SCA from either software aspect ( e.g. , designing \u201c secret-independent \u201d cache access software ) or system aspect .

We believe combining multiple side channels is technically feasible . On the other hand , it seems not aligned with how typical SCA is launched in the real-world scenarios . Overall , we have evaluated three side channels in the paper : - Cache based side channel : denoting a commonly used attack scenario where attackers share the same cache unit with the victim software . - Page table side channel : denoting another common scenario where attackers can monitor the OS page table access pattern . - Read/write side channel : this side channel was considered to be less informative . However , we , * for the first time * , show that quality images can be synthesized from this side channel . Such findings reveal the strength of our approach . Typically , if an attacker can only use page table side channels , it indicates that he is * not * capable of using cache line-based side channel which is indeed finer-grained and more informative . As shown in Table 1 of our paper , cache based side channel indeed \u201c subsumes \u201d page table and read/write side channels . Evaluation consistently shows that image recovered by cache-based side channels are better than images recovered from the other two side channels .
