In particular, they look at the problem of maze testing, where, given a grid of black and white pixels, the goal is to answer whether there is a path from a designated starting point to an ending point. They choose to analyze mazes because they have many nice statistical properties from percolation theory. For one, the problem is solvable with breadth first search in O(L^2) time, for an L x L maze. They show that a CNN can essentially encode a BFS, so theoretically a CNN should be able to solve the problem. Their architecture is a deep feedforward network where each layer takes as input two images: one corresponding to the original maze (a skip connection), and the output of the previous layer. Layers alternate between convolutional and sigmoidal. The authors discuss how this architecture can solve the problem exactly. The pictorial explanation for how the CNN can mimic BFS is interesting but I got a little lost in the 3 cases on page 4. For example, what is r? And what is the relation of the black/white and orange squares? I thought this could use a little more clarity. Though experiments, they show that there are two kinds of minima, depending on whether we allow negative initializations in the convolution kernels. When positive initializations are enforced, the network can more or less mimic the BFS behavior, but never when initializations can be negative. They offer a rigorous analysis into the behavior of optimization in each of these cases, concluding that there is an essential singularity in the cost function around the exact solution, yet learning succumbs to poor optima due to poor initial predictions in training. I thought this was an impressive paper that looked at theoretical properties of CNNs. The problem was very well-motivated, and the analysis was sharp and offered interesting insights into the problem of maze solving. What I thought was especially interesting is how their analysis can be extended to other graph problems; while their analysis was specific to the problem of maze solving, they offer an approach -- e.g. that of finding \"bugs\" when dealing with graph objects -- that can extend to other problems. I would be excited to see similar analysis of other toy problems involving graphs. One complaint I had was inconsistent clarity: while a lot was well-motivated and straightforward to understand, I got lost in some of the details (as an example, the figure on page 4 did not initially make much sense to me).

They show that their analytical solution implements a form of BFS algorithm, characterize the probability of introducing \"bugs\" in the algorithm as the weights move away from the optimal solution, and how this influences the error surface for different depths. This analysis is conducted by drawing on results from the field of critical percolation in physics. Overall, I think this is a good paper and its core contribution is definitely valuable: it provides a novel analysis of an algorithmic task which sheds light on how and when the network fails to learn the algorithm, and in particular the role which initialization plays. The analysis is very thorough and the methods described may find use in analyzing other tasks. In particular, this could be a first step towards better understanding the optimization landscape of memory-augmented neural networks (Memory Networks, Neural Turing Machines, etc) which try to learn reasoning tasks or algorithms. It is well-known that these are sensitive to initialization and often require running the optimizer with multiple random seeds and picking the best one. This work actually explains the role of initialization for learning BFS and how certain types of initialization lead to poor solutions. I am curious if a similar analysis could be applied to methods evaluated on the bAbI question-answering tasks (which can be represented as graphs, like the maze task) and possibly yield better initialization or optimization schemes that would remove the need for multiple random seeds. With that being said, there is some work that needs to be done to make the paper clearer. In particular, many parts are quite technical and may not be accessible to a broader machine learning audience. It would be good if the authors spent more time developing intuition (through visualization for example) and move some of the more technical proofs to the appendix. Specifically: - I think Figure 3 in the appendix should be moved to the main text, to help understand the behavior of the analytical solution. - Top of page 5, when you describe the checkerboard BFS: please include a visualization somewhere, it could be in the Appendix. - Section 6: there is lots of math here, but the main results don't obviously stand out. I would suggest highlighting equations 2 and 4 in some way (for example, proposition/lemma + proof), so that the casual reader can quickly see what the main results are. Interested readers can then work through the math if they want to. Also, some plots/visualizations of the loss surface given in Equations 4 and 5 would be very helpful. Also, although I found their work to be interesting after finishing the paper, I was initially confused by how the authors frame their work and where the paper was heading. They claim their contribution is in the analysis of loss surfaces (true) and neural nets applied to graph-structured inputs. This second part was confusing - although the maze can be viewed as a graph, many other works apply ConvNets to maze environments [1, 2, 3], and their work has little relation to other work on graph CNNs. Here the assumptions of locality and stationarity underlying CNNs are sensible and I don't think the first paragraph in Section 3 justifying the use of the CNN on the maze environment is necessary. However, I think it would make much more sense to mention how their work relates to other neural network architectures which learn algorithms (such as the Neural Turing Machine and variants) or reasoning tasks more generally (for example, memory-augmented networks applied to the bAbI tasks).

We were glad to hear that all reviewers agreed that our paper has novel and positive points . We strived to follow the reviewers \u2019 comments to improve it , especially increasing its clarity . The changes can be viewed in the revised version already submitted . Here we address all the concerns raised by the reviewers , pointing out the correspondent modifications made in the text ( all references made to section , figures and equation are w.r.t.their number in the revised version of the paper ) : MAIN COMMENTS : 1 ) This analysis is hard to follow for non experts in graph theory . This is partly because many non-trivial results are mentioned with little or no explanation . AUTHORS : Following the referee \u2019 s comment we improved the text along the following three main lines : 1 . Further numerical results in the form of snapshots of activations levels and movies tracking the development of activation levels as a function of the layers , were added to the work . This provides direct evidence supporting our analytical claims . 2.The key results in our analytical analysis carried in section 6. have been brought forward so that the key results of the analytical derivation is clearer . 3.The numerical verification of our key results have been brought from the appendix into the main text ( Fig 5 . ) We hope that this would increase the referee \u2019 s confidence in our claims . 2 ) The paper is hard to evaluate . The actual setup seems somewhat arbitrary , but the method of analysing the failure modes is interesting . AUTHORS : The reason we have chosen the proposed toy model is two-fold : i ) it allows the modelling of data structured as planar graphs , an important and actual research topic in the field ; ii ) it allows the use of various tools from theoretical physics to derive non-trivial analytical results from the data . Indeed believe that our analysis of failure mode will be relevant for other problems as well . 3 ) If we trust the authors , then the paper seems good because it is fairly unusual . But it is hard to determine whether the analysis is correct . AUTHORS : To better support the correctness of the presented analysis , we have enhanced the main text with more experimental results and illustrations in the form of figures and movies . Some of them were previously placed in the Appendix ( Fig.5 ) , while others were added to the text ( Fig.3 and 4 ) .We also mention that in Fig.5 our theoretical predictions regarding the error landscape are shown to compare well with numerical experiments ."}}
