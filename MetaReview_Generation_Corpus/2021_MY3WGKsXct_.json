The key idea is not to rely on just reconstruction error but normalizing it via a proposed difficulty score. The reviewers found the problem statement important and the paper easy to follow. However, a common concern in the discussion was the approach is specific to image-to-image translation problems. Many other minor questions were answered by the authors in the rebuttal. Upon discussion post rebuttal, the reviewers decided to maintain their score. AC and reviewers believe that the paper will benefit from better analysis and description of difficulty score and its correlation with reconstruction error. It would be ideal to see how these ideas are useful for a broader problem than image translation.

This is an interesting new application and a meaningful extension of the topic of MIA . It is straightforward to use reconstruction loss as a measure for membership error . However , the authors pointed out that on top of reconstruction loss , the difficulty for the sample should also be taken into account . With that the authors propose a novel method of measuring generation difficulty for each sample by training a regressor to estimate pixel value using the abstract representation by a pre-trained model . The regressor is trained using a portion of randomly selected pixels and tested on the rest . The error of the prediction is use as the indicator of difficulty . This is an intuitive method and from the results of the experiment , the proposed method seems to be quite effective . The reviewer would like the author to clarify a few points : 1 ) is it an assumption that the pre-trained network has never seen any data used in the testing ? If not , what would happen if the data has been seen when training the \u201c feature extractor \u201d but not the victim model ? 2 ) Wouldn \u2019 t it be more application/problem-specific to train a regressor using the data the victim model is conditioned on ( e.g.the segmentation mask ) to predict the pixel values of the ground-truth image in estimating sample difficulty ?", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We thank the reviewer for the dedicated review . The reviewer raised several valid points , which we believe can be satisfactorily addressed . * * '' is it an assumption that the pre-trained network has never seen any data used in the testing ? If not , what would happen if the data has been seen when training the \u201c feature extractor \u201d but not the victim model ? `` * * We do not make any assumption over the existence of an overlap between the ImageNet dataset , on which the pre-trained model is trained , and the dataset used in the attack or the victim model \u2019 s training . In order to verify the difficulty score \u2019 s validity on seen data , we investigated the difficulty scores of 1K train images and 1K test images from the ImageNet dataset . We do not observe any significant difference between the two - both share similar mean and std values : ( 0.055 , 0.018 ) for the train images and ( 0.056 , 0.019 ) for the test images . A ROCAUC score of 51 % further demonstrates that there is no clear difference between the distribution of the difficulty score on seen and unseen images . Figure 14 in Appendix A.10 presents the images that received the highest and lowest scores . We did not observe a visible difference between the train and test images . * * '' Wouldn \u2019 t it be more application/problem-specific to train a regressor using the data the victim model is conditioned on ( e.g.the segmentation mask ) to predict the pixel values of the ground-truth image in estimating sample difficulty ? `` * * We evaluated the effect of training the regression model on the segmentation mask rather than the ground truth image . Both methods achieve very similar results on the Cityscapes dataset and pix2pixHD model : 99.02 % when training on ground-truth vs. 98.82 % when training on the segmentation mask . As the results are similar , with the ground-truth method being slightly superior , we chose to use the more \u201c general \u201d method that only depends on the image and does not depend on the specific input ."}}
