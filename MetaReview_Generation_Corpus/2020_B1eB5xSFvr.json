Differentiable physics simulation is an important research area, especially for optimal control and reinforcement learning. While I am impressed by the large variety of examples demonstrated in the paper, I am leaning towards rejecting the paper because of its poor presentation. The paper only gives a simple and high-level example of the language (optimizing the rest length of springs that form a triangle), very brief descriptions of 10 examples and some discussions about the difficulty of computing useful gradients, but without any in-depth discussion how everything is implemented. This is not enough for an ICLR paper. For example, the paper does not answer some of the fundamental problems of differentiable physics. For example, collision and contact are inherently non-differentiable. How does the paper handle it in the examples of locomotion and billiards (Figure 4)? In addition, how does the paper back-propagate the gradient through the incompressibility conditions (Poisson solve) of fluid simulation? Here is my suggestions how to improve the writing. There are several ways to write the paper, with different emphasis. If this paper is more about introducing a new programming language, Appendix B Compiler Design and Implementation would be important and should be moved to main text. If the paper want to emphasize how to handle the non-differentiable cases of the simulation, then detailed derivations of contact, collision, and linear/nonlinear solving (due to incompressibility conditions or implicit integrators) should be presented. If the paper would like to demonstrate how differentiable physics simulation can help with controller optimization, then two to three examples, such as the locomotion control for soft bodies or rigid bodies, should be analyzed in far more details, and compared with traditional method without differentiable simulation. It is good to focus on one of the above points, based on the venue that this paper is submitted to. Currently, the paper is trying to touch all three.

We have adopted your writing strategy . Now the presentation is focused on the DiffSim system itself , i.e.how to build an efficient and easy-to-use automatic differentiation system for physical simulation . We will add details of every physical simulator in the appendix in the next update , as it may take a while to document 10 different differentiable simulators . Here we briefly answer your questions : * * Rigid Body Collision Gradients * * It is true that discontinuities can happen in rigid body collisions , and at a countable number of discontinuities the objective function is nondifferentiable . However , apart from these discontinuities , the process is still differentiable almost everywhere . The situation of rigid body collision is somewhat similar to the \u201c ReLU \u201d activation function in neural networks : at point x=0 , ReLU is not differentiable ( although continuous ) , yet it is still widely adopted . The rigid body simulation cases are more complex than ReLU , as we have not only non-differentiable points , but also discontinuous points . Based on our experiments , in these impulse-based rigid body simulators ( rigid_body and billiards ) , we still find the gradients useful for optimization , despite the discontinuities , especially with our time-of-impact fix . * * Pressure Projection Gradients in Incompressible Fluids * * We followed the baseline implementation in Autograd , and used 10 Jacobi iterations for pressure projection . Technically , 10 Jacobi iterations are not sufficient to make the velocity field fully divergence-free . However , in this example , it does a decent job , and we are able to successfully backpropagate through the unrolled 10 Jacobi iterations . In larger-scale fluid simulations , 10 Jacobi iterations are likely not sufficient . Assuming the Poisson solve is done by an iterative solver ( e.g.multigrid preconditioned conjugate gradients , MGPCG ) with 5 multigrid levels and 50 conjugate gradient iterations , then automatic differentiation will likely not be able to provide gradients with sufficient numerical accuracy across this long iterative process . The accuracy is likely worse when conjugate gradients present , as they are known to numerically drift as the number of iterations increases . In this case , the user can still use DiffSim to implement the forward MGPCG solver , while implementing the backward part of the Poisson solve manually , likely using adjoint methods [ 1 ] . DiffSim provides \u201c complex kernels \u201d to override the built-in AD system , as shown in appendix C. We have included the above discussions in Appendix E to help future readers , although now we focus more on the system perspective in the main paper .

The system (built on the Taichi system) allows users to specify a forward simulation in a Python-like syntax, after which the program is compiled and iteratively run in both forward-mode and gradients computed for system parameters and controllers, as desired. A variety of simple simulations are included, demonstrating that the automatically generated CUDA code runs as fast as hand-written CUDA code (and noticeably faster than TensorFlow or PyTorch implementations), while requiring far fewer lines of code. The final section details two issues--time of impact errors due to discrete time intervals and gradient explosions with long time horizons--and some potential solutions. *Rating* The paper is interesting and easy to read. While some part of the underlying functionality of DiffSim is directly derived from previous work (Taichi), the paper does describe a non-trivial contribution.
