Thus, I recommend this paper for acceptance.", "reviews": [{"review_id": "r1genAVKPB-0", "review_text": "This paper's contribution is a sample complexity lower bound for linear value-based learning and policy-based learning methods. The bound being exponential in the planning horizon is bad news, and has some implications with respect to further analysing sample complexity in RL. The gist of this paper is that one can craft a hard MDP which requires visiting every state at least once, and that since this MDP's state space is exponential in the MDP's horizon, then there exists a set of MDPs which require an exponential (in the horizon) number of trajectories to be solved. As a consequence, further analysis of sample complexity in RL may need some much stronger assumptions. The writing of the paper is good, I was able to understand everything (I think). As far as I can tell, this is novel work. Unfortunately I am currently unable to see why this contribution is valuable. I have set my score to weak reject but I am very open to having my mind changed, as I feel I may have missed some critical element. I have two criticisms: A- I don't understand why this bound is significantly different than previous bounds. B- I don't understand why this is bad news for representation learning, nor how this failure mode of linear features translates to the \"deep\" case. In the same spirit, I find rather odd the way the paper is introduced. Discussions of representations usually involve some discussion of generalization, but that's not what this paper is about. Deep neural networks/representation learning are only useful if there is an opportunity for generalization. With respect to A, I am either grossly misunderstanding past bounds and/or your bounds, or something is wrong with the way complexities are compared: - In Wen & Van Roy, the \"polynomial\" sample complexity is in the number of states, it is related to |S|x|A|xH^2 (Theorem 3 of Wen & Van Roy) - In this paper, Theorem 4.1 states that the sample complexity is exponential because it is of the form 2^H. One *critical* assumption for this bound is precisely that |S| >= 2^H. Thus the bound that you propose is still polynomial in |S|. I am thus puzzled, how is this bound significantly different? With respect to B, I don't see how this bound has much to do with good representations, or even representations at all. In Lemma A.1, you essentially craft a set of features that, being mutually orthogonal, are in some sense \"mutually linearly separable\", making learning the mapping from those features to a value function \"trivial\" once data is obtained. This is barely different from saying that you assume there is a magical learner that learns in O(1) given the data, because in either case, you need to visit _every_ of the 2^H state in order to solve the MDP, because by construction of your problem, there is _no hope_ of generalization*. Since learning features or creating \"good\" features has everything to do with generalization (otherwise we'd just to tabular), I don't see how this bound is relevant to representations. (We already have Wolpert's no free lunch theorem to tell us that there are always some problems that ML just can't be general enough to solve efficiently. What is more interesting is understanding how we can efficiently learn where there _is_ structure to a problem.) * There is no hope of generalization, unless something about the observation space (which is left undiscussed in the paper) contains *information* about the agent being to the unique path to the reward. In such a case, I can see a probabilistic argument being made where in the worst case the agent needs to visit all 2^H states, but in the average case, the agent may learn to ignore paths where it can generalize that there is no reward. This is not entirely unreasonable, think of e.g. AlphaGo, where very few states end in victory, where there is an exponential number of states in the horizon, yet learning is totally reasonable because of structure in observation. This is where I don't agree with a statement like: \"Since the class of linear functions is a strict subset of many more complicated function classes, including neural networks in particular, our negative results imply lower bounds for these more complex function classes as well.\" ", "rating": "6: Weak Accept", "reply_text": "We thank the reviewer for agreeing our paper is novel .

In our paper , Theorem 4.1 states that the sample complexity is exponential because it is of the form 2^H , and this shows the brittleness of the assumptions that the optimal Q-function can be * perfectly * predicted by the given representation in Wen and Van Roy \u2019 s paper .

Also , more generally , note that , same as our paper , Wen and Van Roy \u2019 s paper also focuses on RL with function approximation , where they are focusing on sufficient conditions for sample efficient RL . To criticism B : We believe the reviewer is not correct in the analogue of Wolpert \u2019 s \u201c no free lunch theorem \u201d here because our lower bound is not simply showing that learning in a binary tree is information-theoretically hard . Our lower bound is a stronger claim about learning with function approximation . Specifically , we are considering a function approximation setting where we assume that we have low dimensional features that well-approximates the value of every policy . In our RL lower bound , we show that even with this strong assumption , generalization is still not possible and requires 2^H samples . Let us try to clarify one potential source of confusion . We definitely agree that learning a binary tree of depth H is information-theoretically difficult with no further assumptions ( as correctly pointed out by the reviewer ) . However , the key to our constructed lower bound is in fact a precise mathematical reduction showing that trying to learn with a good low dimensional representation is in fact no easier than learning a binary tree of depth H , where we know the latter is clearly information-theoretically difficult . In contrast , in supervised learning , we know that linear regression is doable with O ( d ) samples , and Wolpert \u2019 s \u201c no free lunch theorem \u201d is not relevant in the linear regression setting ( when we assume that regression function well-approximates the target function , as we do in our setting ) . From a technical standpoint , the proofs require non-trivial constructions of features , which to our knowledge , are the first set of analyses of such kind . Therefore , the lower bound with function approximation is significantly different from existing bounds for tabular RL . Furthermore , for the value-based learning lower bound , we establish an intriguing connection between reinforcement learning with function approximation and approximate rank . For policy-based learning , we used lower bound on the size of eps-nets .

The derived theorems show that there exists MDPs which require an exponential number of samples to learn a near-optimal policy even if a good-but-not-perfect representation is given to the agent for both value-based and policy-based learning. These results constitute the first lower bounds for RL with linear function approximation. Representation learning is an important area of research and this paper advances our theoretical understanding in a notable way, helping to elucidate the limits of representation learning alone.

The discussion also contained interesting points and summarized possible implications of the theoretical results. Overall, I think this paper presents a solid contribution and recommend acceptance. Although the paper was clear in general, I would like to have certain points clarified: 1) Just to check, is it still possible that there exists certain representations that are not perfect but do lead to sample efficient learning? If I'm interpreting the results correctly, the theorems only posit the existence of a representation that is good in the sense of approximation error, but bad in terms of sample complexity, which does not necessarily preclude the possibility of other efficient representations. 2) More generally, why is it that there are few results for lower bounds when it seems like an obvious direction? Are there technical barriers to proving such results? 3) For value-based learning, the good representation has approximation error \\Omega(\\sqrt(H / d)). Could the authors explain why this assumption on the error is reasonable? 3) In assumption 4.4, the features are assumed to have an l2-norm of 1. This seems like a fairly restrictive assumption. How important is this assumption and can it be relaxed? 4) Also, in theorem 4.2, it is assumed that the dimension of the features, d = H. This would seem to allow the possibility of policy-based learning being sample efficient when the number of features is much smaller. The paper is well-polished with few noticeable typos.

Thus , our lower bounds critically rely on the fact that H is large . To utilize this , we need constructions and techniques different from those in supervised learning and bandit problems . As we have discussed in the paper , our lower bound is due to a distribution mismatch in the sense that the agent does not know which distribution to use for minimizing a ( supervised ) learning error . 3 ) In many scenarios , the representation is the last layer of a neural network .
