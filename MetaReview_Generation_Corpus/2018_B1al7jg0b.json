Figure 2 is almost identical, again a reference to the original would be better.

The notion of conceptors is appealing in this particular use for its interpretation in terms of regularizer and in terms of Boolean logic. The numeric examples, although quite toy, provide a clear illustration. A few things are still missing to back the strong claims of this paper: * Some considerations of the computational costs: the reliance on the full NxN correlation matrix R makes me fear it might be costly, as it is applied to every layer of the neural networks and hence is the largest number of units in a layer. This is of course much lighter than if it were the covariance matrix of all the weights, which would be daunting, but still deserves to be addressed, if only with wall time measures. * It could also be welcome to use a more grounded vocabulary, e.g. on p.2 \u201cFigure 1 shows examples of conceptors computer from three clouds of sample state points coming from a hypothetical 3-neuron recurrent network that was drive with input signals from three difference sources\u201d could be much more simply said as \u201cFigure 1 shows the ellipses corresponding to three sets of R^3 points\u201d.

I realise not everyone has the computational or engineering resources to try extensively on multiple benchmarks from classification to reinforcement learning. Nevertheless, without going to that extreme, it might be worth adding an extra demo on something bigger than MNIST. The authors transparently explain in their answer that they do not (yet!) belong to the deep learning community and hope finding some collaborations to pursue this further. If I may make a suggestion, I think their work would get much stronger impact by doing it the reverse way: first finding the collaboration, then adding this extra empirical results, which then leads to a bigger impact publication.
