However, I think the paper is borderline. Reviewers were impressed by the results, but not convinced that the ablations and analyses were sufficient to motivate the proposed methods, suggesting that some variants of the proposed methods could likely be substantially better. In addition, I agree strongly with R3 that framing this work around 'language structure' is disingenuous, and actively misleads readers about the contribution to the paper.", "reviews": [{"review_id": "BJgQ4lSFPH-0", "review_text": "This paper proposes to use additional structures within and between sentences for pre-training BERT.
