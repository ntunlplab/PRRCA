We will reply to your points in order . - Quantitative comparison . We have added a new Table 3 to include quantitative comparisons on the CelebA 64x64 dataset . Our method achieves FID of 5.98 , which is competitive to the state-of-the-art GAN-based method . We also report FID scores on LSUN datasets in Appendix C.4 ( in the caption of generated samples ) . According to Tables 1 and 3 , our method outperforms [ 1 ] by a large margin on both CIFAR-10 and CelebA datasets . As for comparison to [ 2 ] , we would like to emphasize that our goal is to learn explicit energy-based models , which have a number of promising applications and desirable properties as shown by [ 3 , 4 ] , whereas [ 2 ] parametrizes and learns implicit score models that may not correspond to the gradient of an energy . In the ablation study , we include a result of ( T=1000 , K=0 ( DSM ) ) , where we use exactly the same implementation as in [ 2 ] , and replace the implicit score model by the gradient of the explicit energy-based model . For this explicit energy-based model we consider , learning by maximizing recovery likelihood ( T=6 , K=50 ) achieves better performance than learning by [ 2 ] ( T=1000 , K=0 ( DSM ) ) . We have added more explanation to the ablation study ( section 4.2 ) . - About experimental evidence . We would like to clarify that the difference between [ 2 ] and ( T=1000 , K=0 ( DSM ) ) is only about the parametrization of the score function . [ 2 ] directly parametrizes the score function with a U-net network without explicitly parameterizing the energy function , whereas ( T=1000 , K=0 ( DSM ) ) parametrizes the score function with the gradient of an explicit energy function . ( T=1000 , K=0 ( DSM ) ) uses the same training objective and procedure as [ 2 ] . The gap between [ 2 ] and ( T=1000 , K=0 ( DSM ) ) indicates that [ 2 ] performs worse when it is applied to learning an explicit energy function instead of a score function . For the explicit energy-based model , learning by maximizing recovery likelihood ( T = 6 , K =50 ) performs better than learning by [ 2 ] or denoising score matching . This result also motivates a future work about searching for an optimal explicit energy function that is suitable for the objective of [ 2 ] . - About comparison of ( T=1000 , K=0 ( DSM ) ) and ( T=1000 , K=0 ) . In section 3.4 we have shown that the training objectives of the two settings agree with each other . In the revision we add a new section Appendix A.4 to further show that the learning gradient of maximizing normal approximation ( T=1000 , K=0 ( DSM ) ) is roughly the same as the one of maximizing recovery likelihood ( T=1000 , K=0 ) . Table 2 shows that ( T=1000 , K=0 ( DSM ) ) and ( T=1000 , K=0 ) achieve similar sample quality in terms of quantitative metrics , where ( T=1000 , K=0 ( DSM ) ) gives a slightly better FID score while ( T=1000 , K=0 ) achieves a slightly better inception score . This result further verifies that the training procedures of ( T=1000 , K=0 ( DSM ) ) and ( T=1000 , K=0 ) are consistent with each other . - About typos and suggestions .

It constructs a sequence of noisy version of data and learn a conditional between consecutive noisy pairs . Compare to working with the likelihood directly , doing so makes the training much easier .

We will reply to your points in order . - About applications other than image generations . We have added a new experiment of image inpainting in section 4.1 and Appendix C.3 . Specifically , the inpainting is achieved by running Langevin dynamics progressively on the masked pixels while keeping the observed pixels fixed at decreasingly lower noise levels . We demonstrate that the learned model is capable of realistic and semantically meaningful image inpainting on CelebA and LSUN datasets . We will further explore other applications of energy-based models using our method in the future work . - About the model architecture In the early experiments , we also tried to use some other architectures . For example , for the energy function , we once used a 5-layer convolutional neural network instead of the residual network , which works reasonably well on simple datasets such as SVHN and MNIST . For the embedding of the timestep , we have tried to learn a separate top fully connected layer for each time step instead of using the Transformer sinusoidal position embedding . As [ 1 ] pointed out , such parametrization is optimal if the network is powerful enough . In practice , it results in worse but still reasonable sample quality ( on CIFAR-10 , FID 18.34 , inception 8.10 ) . - About T = 6 and K = 10 . Does the optimization diverge or something ? Yes , in this case the optimization diverges . The loss explodes to a very large negative value and samples are not realistic any more . This is because with limited sampling steps , the sampling chains fail to reach the local modes of the current model , and therefore for the learning gradient ( equation 3 ) , $ E_ { \\mathbf { x } \\sim p_\\theta } [ \\frac { \\partial } { \\partial \\theta } f_\\theta ( \\mathbf { x } ) ] $ can not keep pace with $ E_ { \\mathbf { x } \\sim p_\\text { data } } [ \\frac { \\partial } { \\partial \\theta } f_\\theta ( \\mathbf { x } ) ] $ . Following your suggestion , we have included a plot of FID scores over iterations in Figure 7 , where we compare the FID scores of models trained with different sampling steps . - About the sampler . We apply HMC sampler for long-run chain analysis as it can generally explore better than Langevin dynamics . Following your suggestion , we have performed long-run chain sampling using No-U-Turn sampler ( NUTS ) and included the results in section 4.3 and Appendix C.1 . We apply the same step size schedule obtained for HMC to NUTS . The long-run chain samples are still realistic after 100k steps in total and the FID score remains stable , indicating the validity of the learned potential . - The reason why long-run MCMC works . Is it because we only need relative short-run MCMC for convergence when using recovery likelihood so that the bias is actually small ? Yes , you are right . The reason is that the conditional distribution defined by recovery likelihood has a much simpler energy landscape , where the short-run MCMC has higher chance to converge , so that the model could be less biased . - Relation to amortized MCMC . Compared to short-run MCMC [ 2 ] , our method can be considered amortizing the MCMC sampling by a sequence of models at different time steps . Specifically , during testing , the MCMC sampling at time step t is initialized using samples obtained from t+1 , and therefore models from t+1 to T can be considered an approximation network for the samples at t. Such amortization allows us to use less sampling steps than [ 2 ] during training . - About references . We have included and discussed the two references that you mentioned in sections 1 and 2 .

( 2020 ) ) instead of training unconditional EBMs . Each conditional energy describes the probability of recovering x , given its noisy version \\hat { x } . The noisy version of x can be described as a normal distribution centered at x , so the condition EBM has an additional term ||x - \\hat { x } ||^2 , which constrains the Langevin dynamics to remain in the vicinity of \\hat { x } , so it converges faster ! The inference is that starting at white noise x_0 , it defines a conditional EBMs given x_0 , runs Langaving dynamics to sample from P ( x|x_0 ) defined by the conditional EBMs , and then use the sample as the evidence of another conditional EBMs . I assume the main advantage of this training over Ho et al . ( 2020 ) is having an energy-based model that can be used in other applications , so that would be nice to see the performance of trained EBMs on some applications other than image generation such as image inpainting and robust classification as discussed in Du and Mordatch ( 2019 ) . In general , I believe that this is an exciting paper and an important step towards training better EBMs . In connection to score matching , Saremi et al .

The inference is that starting at white noise x_0 , it defines a conditional EBMs given x_0 , runs Langaving dynamics to sample from P ( x|x_0 ) defined by the conditional EBMs , and then use the sample as the evidence of another conditional EBMs . I assume the main advantage of this training over Ho et al . ( 2020 ) is having an energy-based model that can be used in other applications , so that would be nice to see the performance of trained EBMs on some applications other than image generation such as image inpainting and robust classification as discussed in Du and Mordatch ( 2019 ) . In general , I believe that this is an exciting paper and an important step towards training better EBMs . In connection to score matching , Saremi et al .

We will reply to your points in order . - About applications of energy-based models As you suggested , we have added a new experiment on image inpainting in section 4.1 and Appendix C.3 . Specifically , given a masked image and the corresponding mask , we first obtain a sequence of perturbed masked images at different noise levels . The inpainting is achieved by running Langevin dynamics progressively on the masked pixels while keeping the observed pixels fixed at decreasingly lower noise levels . We demonstrate that the learned model is capable of realistic and semantically meaningful image inpainting on CelebA and LSUN datasets . As for the robust classification experiment in [ 1 ] , it has been used for evaluating conditional EBMs given labels , whereas we mainly focus on learning unconditional EBMs in this work . However , we totally agree with you that it would be an interesting future direction to learn conditional EBMs by our method and apply the learned models to robust classification . - About references Thanks for the two references , which are indeed very relevant . We have cited and discussed them in section 1 and section 3.4 . - About typos We have fixed them in the revision . Thanks for pointing them out . [ 1 ] Yilun Du and Igor Mordatch .
