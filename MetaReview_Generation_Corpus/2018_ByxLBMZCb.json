As the authors state, this paper provides a unifying perspective to the subject (it justifies the results of others through this unifying theory, but also provides new results; e.g., there are results that do not depend on assumptions on the target data matrix Y). Originality: The paper provides similar results to previous work, while removing some of the assumptions made in previous work. In that sense, the originality of the results is weak, but definitely there is some novelty in the methodology used to get to these results. Thus, I would say original. Importance: The paper deals with the important problem of when and why training algorithms might get to global/local/saddle critical points. While there are no direct connections with generalization properties, characterizing the landscape of neural networks is an important topic to make further steps into better understanding of deep learning. It will attract some attention at the conference. Clarity: The paper is well-written - some parts need improvement, but overall I'm satisfied with the current version. Comments: 1.

The paper studies locally open maps, which preserve the local minima geometry. Hence a local minima of l(F(W)) is a local minima of l(s) when s=F(W) is a locally open map. Theorem 3 provides conditions under which the multiplication X*Y is a locally open map. For a pyramidal feed forward net, if the weights in each layer have full rank, input X is full rank, and the link function is invertible, then that local minima is a global minima. Comments: The locally open maps (Behrends 2017) is an interesting concept. However I am not convinced that the paper is able to show stronger results about the geometry of linear/neural networks. Further the claims all over the paper, comparing with the existing works. are over the top and not justified. I believe the paper needs a significant rewriting. The results are not a strict improvement over existing works. For neural networks, Nguyen and Hein (2017) assume the link function is differentiable. This paper assumes the link function is invertible. Both papers can handle sigmoid/tanh, but cannot handle ReLU. Results for linear networks are not an improvement over existing works. Paper claims to remove assumption on Y, but they get much weaker results as they cannot differentiate between saddle points and global minima, for a critical point. Results are also written in a confusing way as stating each critical point is a saddle or a global minima. Instead the presentation can be simplified by just discussing the equivalency between local minima and global minima, as the proposed framework cannot handle critical points directly. Proof of Lemma 7 seems to have typos/mistakes. What is \\bar{W_i}? Why are the first two equations just showing d_i \\leq d_i ? How do you use this to conclude locally openness of \\mathcal{M}?

It uses the notion of a locally open map to draw equivalences between local optima and global optima. The basic idea is that for fitting nonlinear models with a convex loss, if the mapping from the weights to the outputs is open, then every local optimum in weight space corresponds to a local optimum in output space; by convexity, in output space every local optimum is global. This is mostly a \u201ctheory building\u201d work. With an appropriate fix, lemma 4 gives a cleaner set of assumptions than previous work in the same space (Nguyen + Hein \u201917), but yields essentially the same conclusions. The notion of local openness seems very well adapted to deriving these type of results in a clean manner. The result in Section 3 on local openness of matrix multiplication on its range (which is substantially motivated by Behrends 2017) may be of independent interest. I did not check the proof of this result in detail, but it appears to be correct. For the linear, deep case, the paper corrects imprecisions in the previous work (Lu + Kawaguchi). For deep nonlinear networks, the results require the \u201cpyramidal\u201d assumption that the dimensionality is nonincreasing with respect to layer and (more restrictively) the feature dimension in the first layer is larger than the number of input points. This seems to differ from typical practice, in the sense that it does not allow for wide intermediate layers. This seems to be a limitation of the methodology: unless I'm missing something, this situation cannot be addressed using locally open maps. There are some imprecisions in the writing.
