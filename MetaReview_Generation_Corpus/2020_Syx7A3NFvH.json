This is done under sensible restrictions on the state transition distribution, which can be claimed to hold true in realistic networked settings. The authors argue that introducing a spatial discount factor (along a temporal one), where neighboring nodes have a small distance, stabilizes learning. Also, they provide a way of learning a networked communication protocol. Experiments are done on somewhat realistic simulations of traffic. I am not an expert in this type of distributed MARL, and what the SotA there is. What is proposed here makes sense to me, even though it also does not look very surprising to me. Spatial discounting seems to make sense. The authors do not comment on the relationship between the d_{ij} (or how to choose them) with the neighborhood graph, I suppose that neighbors have short distances, while non-neighbors have not. The NeurComm protocol is a bit vague to me, and I cannot say how it relates to other proposals. I find it a bit strange (unless I misunderstood something) that complete state and policy information is transmitted to every neighbor, and on top some latent vector. This sounds expensive to me, surely these communication channels are limited? It'd be more interesting to consider bandwidth limitations here. Without knowing related work on other protocols in detail, I suspect they probably work less well than NeurComm, simply because they allow for smaller messages only (f.ex., whereas they talk about \"policy fingerprints\", they seem to submit the complete policy parameters to neighbors -- that is not just a fingerprint). Maybe I am wrong, but if so, the paper does not explain things properly (there is some encoding and decoding going on, but just to propagate the hidden states at each node). To me as an outsider, this looks like interesting work with well-simulated experiments. Of course, these are simulated and allow for no real-world conclusions, but then much of RL work does neither. It is just I'd be hard pressed to say what is really surprising in this paper, and what could be learned from it.

'' Please note the spatiotemporal MDP formulation ( and the associated spatial discount factor ) is completely new for MARL , though it is a natural extension from traditional ( temporal ) MDP . NeurComm also contains new features on top of SotA protocols , based on the understanding of non-stationarity and information loss in MARL . `` Clarification on d_ { ij } selection . '' d_ { ij } here is the distance between nodes i and j in the graph ( i.e.number of spatiotemporal MDP steps between agents i and j ) rather than the physical distance . `` How NeurComm is related to existing protocols ? they probably work less well than NeurComm , simply because they allow for smaller messages only . '' As stated in Section 2 and 4 , NeurComm differs from existing protocols as it 1 ) encodes and concatenates messages instead of aggregating them and 2 ) includes fingerprint in message . We agree that the additional fingerprint info helps NeurComm perform better . However , it is indeed our contribution to demonstrate that these particular neural-encoded neighborhood fingerprints would enhance the actor performance . For example , the recent work of mean-field RL ( MFRL ) demonstrated that additional information of averaged neighborhood policies would enhance the Q-value estimation ( Yang , 2018 ) . However , in heterogenous NMARL ( e.g.ATSC Monaco ) the neighbors have various action spaces and the aggregation becomes infeasible . Thus , NeurComm can be considered as a more general and robust communication protocol , based on a similar idea . Further , compared to existing protocols , the only additional message of each agent in NeurComm is its fingerprint , whose size is small enough compared to the size of belief ( latent vector ) . In our experiments , the max fingerprint size is 6 whereas the belief size is 64 . Also , the fingerprint is the same as policy in this work since A2C is on-policy . In off-policy algorithms such as DDPG , Q-learning , it has to be represented in other formats since behavior policy is not directly available ( see ( Foerster et al. , 2017 ) ) . `` Communication is expensive in practice . '' This is a good point . The community addresses communication scalability mostly from communication channels rather than message contents . In general MARL , each agent sends message to all other agents , leading to expensive global communication . So a collection of works focus on the attention mechanism . For each agent , the attention model gives a prioritized list of agents to be communicated with , so appropriate `` neighborhood '' can be formed to meet certain bandwidth limit . See the last paragraph of Section 2 for more details . However , in our problem setting , the neighborhood is already defined and usually small enough . Thus there is no need to apply attention further to select a subset of neighbors . We agree that scalability of message content should also be considered in practice . In our experiment , each message ( start+policy+belief ) has < 100 floats so it is still affordable . Additional compression can be performed if the message is big . For example , we can add additional message output layer on top of the belief layer to meet the limit of message size .

This work focuses on networked system control where the network topology is usually well-defined and static so the neighborhood-based assumption is automatically valid . However , our formulation can be extended to general non-network MARL environments as well , by integrating the attention mechanism . The high-level idea here is to form ( dynamic ) virtual `` neighborhood '' based on the impact strengths of all other agents on the target agent , which can be done by an attention mechanism ( ATOC , IC3 , etc ) , given a target neighborhood size ( or bandwidth limit ) . Then our methods can be applied to this dynamic virtual network . `` It would be nice to explain why / what communication strategy enables FPrint to do better than NeurComm . '' First , NeurComm still outperforms SotA communication protocols so this performance difference mainly comes from the difference between communicative vs non-communicative algorithms ( Note FPrint only takes neighborhood information and does not have message-passing feature ) . Second , all communicative algorithms in experiment perform delayed information sharing ( e.g.belief-message from d-distance away was generated d-step ago ) . Thus , this result implies that in real-time and mission-critical tasks such as CACC , delayed messages would distract the agent and hurt its performance , despite the additional information they provide .

We are glad that the reviewer found this work an important step for real-world MARL applications in the future . Below is our response to the major comments . `` NeurComm does not outperform FPrint baseline in CACC scenarios . '' First of all , we have not claimed that a single algorithm ( e.g.NeurComm ) would win in all real-world networked MARL ( NMARL ) environments . Actually , we do not believe such a universal algorithm exists , due to the severe partial observability and various MDP properties across real-world NMARL environments . Also , most of the recent MARL algorithms were only tested in multiple scenarios of a single fully observable environment rather than multiple partially observable environments , leading to similar experimental results ( and potential overfitting ) . For example , MADDPG , IC3 ( CommNet ) , ConseNet , Mean-field RL , ATOC were evaluated in only 2D space environment with freely moving dots ( scenarios : cooperative navigation , predator-prey , battle game etc ) ; FPrint , ( Zhang , 2019 ) , ( Carion , 2019 ) were evaluated in only Starcraft environment ( scenarios : 5m_vs_5m , 3s_vs_4z , 6h_vs_8z , etc ) . Further , rather than proposing a single algorithm , our contributions are indeed two novel methods : 1 ) \\alpha to stabilize MARL under partial observability and 2 ) NeurComm to improve messages under non-stationarity . The effectiveness of both methods are clearly demonstrated in ablation study and experiments . Specifically , NeurComm outperforms SotA communication protocols even if it does not outperform FPrint ( which is also not the baseline , but the one trained w/ \\alpha ) in CACC . Therefore , the statement is more like `` communicative algorithms do not outperform \\alpha-stabilized non-communicative algorithms in CACC '' , rather than `` NeurComm does not outperform FPrint baseline in CACC '' . Recalling the major difference between NeurComm and FPrint is the belief-message passing , this implies that in real-time and mission-critical tasks such as CACC , additional delayed messages would distract the agent and hurt its performance ( as stated in the first paragraph under Section 5.5 ) . But this is the comparison between two algorithm groups ( communicative vs non-communicative ) and can not be used to judge the effectiveness of NeurComm protocol . Similarly , we can imagine Q-learning ( off-policy ) would outperform A2C ( on-policy ) in this case since the replay buffer is more powerful in exploring good policies with sparse collision penalties , but this is neither the controlled evaluation on our method . So we re-implemented all methods in A2C even though some of them ( FPrint , DIAL etc ) were originally proposed in the context of Q-learning . We also proposed a way to overcome delays in information sharing via multi-pass communication ( see the description under Eq . ( 5 ) ) .This will improve the performance of communicative algorithms in CACC but also bring scalability/latency issues in practice . `` More test cases are needed . '' Thanks for the suggestion , we are planning to implement other realistic NMARL environments . However , this requires engineering efforts and domain-specific knowledge , and heavy experiment part would make this paper unbalanced , diluting the algorithm contributions ( even in its current version , we had to defer most implementation details of CACC to appendix ) . So we selected two typical and popular real-world applications to show how our methods would improve the robustness and efficiency of NMARL in general .
