We think that all of the \u201c cons \u201d provided represent minor issues which can be fixed , and we address them further below . As such , only the claim that our paper is of \u201c low significance \u201d remains as a potential reason for the rejection . We disagree with that assessment , for the following reasons : - Application-orientedness : Indeed , our paper addresses a problem relevant to using variational models for compression , which is an \u201c application \u201d of neural networks . However , numerous \u201c application \u201d papers are submitted to ICLR every year . We do not think that compression as such is any less important than , say , natural language processing . - Generality : More importantly , we are not presenting \u201c yet another compression method \u201d . Our method for achieving machine determinism is relevant and applicable to all latent variable models . This includes some of the state of the art models for learned compression . - Optimality : We can not guarantee that our method is optimal , or the only solution to this problem , for that matter . This is due to the nature of the problem ( optimizing fully discrete models is hard ) . However , as far as we know , this problem has never been addressed before in a learning context or in this generality . It does not represent incremental work , but a qualitative contribution . The fact that there now exists a first documented solution to this problem , which can be used as a baseline for future work , is a strong point for qualifying our paper . We hope that the reviewer will respond to this and clarify what exactly is the reason for their rejection . We do not think we understand the reasoning at this point . Regarding the other points made : - We give two examples for the bit widths , because they show how the relevant parameters can be chosen in conjunction with different activation functions . We talk about this in the following paragraphs . We do not understand why the reviewer thinks that giving two examples for something constitutes bad quality . - Replacing the gradient of a quantization function ( i.e.round ( ) ) with the identity is not a new idea ( see , for example , Theis ( 2017 ) , which we cite , among many others ) . If the reviewer would like a justification , how about the following : Taking the gradient of round ( ) yields a sum of Dirac delta distributions , i.e. , d/dx round ( x ) = sum_i delta ( x-i ) . Obviously , this gradient function is not going to be helpful for optimization , because it will produce too much variance in the gradients ( +infinity for the half-integer positions , and 0 everywhere else ) . However , a smoothed version of it is helpful . If we convolve this gradient function with a triangle function ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_function , which can be seen as the generator function for linear splines ) to smooth it , the result is a constant ( 1 ) , which corresponds to the identity function when used in backpropagation . - K is not a kernel , but the bit-width of the kernel ( the kernel itself is defined as H ) . K is defined right after equation ( 7 ) , where it is first mentioned . We modified the language to distinguish better between the kernel and its bit width . However , we believe that given sufficient time and care , any reader should have been able to distinguish this from the context . - We have to push back on the claim that we did not conduct enough experiments leading up to our conclusion that ( 16 ) causes instabilities . In fact , our initial goal was to simply reuse ( 16 ) , since it had been already published and is simpler . However , the results were consistently worse , and on further inspection , we observed that the prior and the encoder would always end up in a kind of oscillatory behavior . We will try to find a visualization of this for the final paper . Theis ( 2017 ) used Gaussian scale mixtures centered on 0 as the prior , which is a form of regularization and might have helped reduce this , as it would prevent arbitrary shifts . However , we would like to be able to use arbitrarily powerful priors , as is generally the goal in variational approximation . The combination of ( 17 ) and ( 18 ) is unfortunately slightly less simple to implement , but it has the benefit that the prior distribution need not be subjected to regularization , and thus enables a more general solution . So , this choice was not only informed by empirical results , but also by the desire to be able to do without regularization ."}, {"review_id": "S1zz2i0cY7-1", "review_text": "The paper presents a very important problem of utilizing a model on different platforms with own numerical round-offs. As a result, a model run on a different hardware or software than the one on which it was trained could completely fail due to numerical rounding-off issues. This problem has been considered in various papers, however, the classification task was mainly discussed. In this paper, on the other hand, the authors present how the numerical rounding-off issue could be solved in Latent-Variable Models (LVM). In order to cope with the numerical rouding-off issue, the authors propose to use integer networks. They consider either quantized ReLU (QReLU) or quantized Tanh (Qtanh). Further, in order to properly train the integer NN, they utilize a bunch of techniques proposed in the past, mainly (Balle, 2018) and (Balle et al., 2018). However, as pointed out in the paper, some methods prevent training instabilities (e.g., Eqs. 18 and 19). All together, the paper tackles very important problem and proposes very interesting solution by bringing different techniques proposed for quantized NNs together . Pros: + The paper is well-written. + The considered problem is of great importance and it is rather neglected in the literature. + The experiments are properly carried out. + The obtained results are impressive. Cons: - A natural question is whether the problem could be prevented by post-factum quantization of a neural network. As pointed out in the Discussion section, such procedure failed. However, it would be beneficiary to see an empirical evidence for that. - It would be also interesting to see how a training process of an integer NN looks like. Since the NN is quantized, instabilities during training might occur. Additionally, its training process may take longer (more epochs) than a training of a standard (float) NN. An exemplary plot presenting a comparison between an integer NN training process and a standard NN training process would be highly appreciated. - (Minor remark). The paper is well-written, however, it would be helpful to set the final learning algorithm.

We believe a solution which tries to maximize usage of the dynamic range of both the kernel coefficients and the activations , such as ours , can perform better , because it minimizes the quantization error throughout the network . In a post-training quantization approach , the actual range of activations would need to be measured empirically , and then a solution to a set of complex constraints would need to be found .

This feels like an added layer of complexity when trying to train these networks.
