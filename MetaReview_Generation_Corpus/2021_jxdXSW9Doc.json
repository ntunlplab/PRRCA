It studies optimal learning rates of the generalization bounds both in expectation and in probability . In the case of DKRR with random features , the optimal learning rate in expectation is shown to achieve by relaxing the requirement on the number of partitions from $ O ( 1 ) $ ( Li et al. , 2019a ) to $ O ( |D|^ { 0.5 } ) $ ( Theorem 1 ) . Within the same setup of random features , the number of partitions is relaxed to $ O ( |D|^ { 0.25 } ) $ guaranteeing optimal generalization performance in probability ( Theorem 2 ) . The latter bound $ O ( |D|^ { 0.25 } ) $ on partition count is much smaller then $ O ( |D|^ { 0.5 } ) $ . However , as proved in Theorem 3 , allowing multiple communication rounds in DKRR-RF , up to $ O ( |D|^ { 0.5 } ) $ partitions can be handled depending on the number of communication rounds . In other words , it can exploit more partitions at the cost of more communication rounds . The idea of DKRR with random features and communications is a combination of DKRR with random features studied in ( Li et al. , 2019a ) and DKRR with communications studied in ( Lin et al. , 2020 ) . It seems that the communication strategy and Algorithm 1 presented in section 3 are adaptations from ( Lin et al. , 2020 ) handling random feature , which should be properly mentioned and credited .

In ( Rudi \\ & Rosasco , 2017 ) , they show that the optimal generalization bounds of KRR can be derived requiring only $ O ( \\sqrt { |\\mathcal { D } | } ) $ random features in the basic setting , as one can see that $ M=\\sqrt { |\\mathcal { D } | } \\ll|\\mathcal { D } | $ , so the total computational complexity is $ \\mathcal { O } ( M^2|\\mathcal { D } | ) $ . Thus , the computational bottleneck in learning with random Fourier features to guarantee the optimal generalization performance not only depends on the size of random features , but also on the size of dataset . If we do n't consider reducing the size of $ \\mathcal { D } $ , the computational complexity is $ |\\mathcal { D } |^2 $ in the basic setting , which is not suitable for large scale problems . Thus , how to reduce the size of $ \\mathcal { D } $ is a key problem to further improve the effectiveness for optimal learning rates ; ( 2 ) Distributed learning is one of the most popular methods to reduce the size of dataset . The distributed learning bring the distributed error , but can decrease the variance of the model ( See Proposition 1 in appendix or Zhang et al. , 2013 , 2015 , or Li et al. , 2019a ) . Thus , how to choose an appropriate number of partitions to trade off the distributed error and the variance to guarantee the optimal performance is a very interesting and significant direction . In this paper , we prove that the optimal learning rate in expectation is shown to achieve by relaxing the requirement on the number of partitions from $ O ( 1 ) $ ( Li et al. , 2019a ) to $ O ( |\\mathcal { D } |^ { 0.5 } ) $ in the basic setting ( Theorem 1 ) , so we can reduce the computational complexity from $ \\mathcal { O } ( |\\mathcal { D } |^2 ) $ ( plain KRR with random features ) to $ \\mathcal { O } ( |\\mathcal { D } |^ { 1.5 } ) $ . From ( Rudi \\ & Rosasco , 2017 ; Rudi et al. , 2018 ) , we can further reduce the size of random features by generating in a data-dependent manner under some more stricter conditions ( Theorem 3 in Rudi \\ & Rosasco , 2017 ) . However , in this case , the item $ |\\mathcal { D } | $ has no change , and even become more dominate in total computational complexity . If combining our results ( see Theorem 4,5,6 in appendix ) with the data-dependent manner-based random features ( Rudi \\ & Rosasco , 2017 ) under some more stricter conditions , we can reduce the size of random features and increase the partitions at the same time ( see Remark 4 in appendix ) . ( 3 ) Moreover , when combining the distributed learning , random features and the preconditioned conjugate gradient ( PCG ) , we can further speed up the KRR ( see in Remark 3 ) , which may open a path to reach the linear time complexity for optimal learning rate in the basic setting .
