So I encourage the authors to add a section to discuss it . $ \\textbf { R4.1 } $ : Most papers that we \u2019 re comparing with , including classic papers like KD [ 2 ] , AT [ 3 ] but also state-of-the-art methods like RKD [ 4 ] , PKT [ 5 ] , a Teacher is always available . Furthermore , we primarily focused on classification and all the papers we are comparing with are also focusing on classification problems . Furthermore , it is not clear how KD can be applied for regression tasks . This is because one of the key features of knowledge distillation is using the soft outputs of the teacher as supervisory signals for supervised learning which capture inter-class dependencies ( as opposed to using one-hot labels ) . For regression , there are no such signals as the network outputs the regressed values only . On the contrary , we can argue that since our method focuses on improving the penultimate layer 's output feature , it can be effective for regression tasks too . So , we did follow your advice and applied our method to a regression problem : facial landmark localisation . Given a facial image the task is to localise a set of facial landmarks in terms of ( x , y ) coordinates which can be solved by using a conv . net to directly regress the ( x , y ) coordinates of the facial landmarks . We used the WFLW [ 1 ] dataset , which is one of the hardest benchmarks for this task . Performance is measured in terms of Normalised Mean Error ( lower is better ) , the standard metric for the problem . In our experiment , we used a ResNet50 as the teacher and a ResNet8 as the student .

The proposed framework is very simple : use the teacher 's final fully-connected layer ( or , 'projection matrix $ W $ ' in the paper ) to obtain both the teacher 's and the student 's logit output and optimize the student network by minimizing the gap between two logits . Experiments cover various network architectures on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets and show improvements over the other competitive knowledge distillation methods . * * Strengths * * 1 .

More specifically , representation learning , in our paper , refers to a training procedure which focuses on improving the representational capacity of the output of the penultimate layer of the student , i.e.the feature just before the student \u2019 s linear layer , denoted as $ h^S $ in our paper . 1 ) The term representation capacity refers to that feature ( $ h^S $ ) and not the final fully-connected layer ( projection matrix ) . This definition has been used widely in recent work on self-supervised learning [ 1 , 2 ] 2 ) Because the teacher 's projection matrix remains frozen , applying $ L_ { SR } $ loss is directly focusing on optimizing $ h^S $ .

The paper only shows empirical results where $ L_ { SR } $ works better than $ L_ { KD } $ . This argument is not easily accepted for me , so more theoretical backup is necessary . $ \\textbf { R3.2 } $ : Unfortunately , we do not have a theoretical justification for this claim . However , in addition to the improved accuracy results obtained by our method , we do have an experiment which provides further empirical evidence : Section 4 -- Transferability of representations , where we compare the representational power of the student \u2019 s feature $ h_s $ trained with KD and with our method . Clearly , our method can train a more powerful feature representation which generalizes better when employed on a different dataset ( trained on CIFAR ; tested on STL10 ) . $ \\textbf { Q3.3 } $ : Study on the hyper-parameter \u03b1 and \u03b2 on eq ( 8 ) is missing $ \\textbf { R3.3 } $ : Thank you for pointing this out , this was an omission . We did only a basic search to find the best hyper-parameters . First , we fix $ \\alpha $ and search for the best $ \\beta $ . Then , we used the best $ \\beta $ , and search for the best $ \\alpha $ . This is suboptimal compared to a full grid search over $ \\alpha $ and $ \\beta $ . Furthermore , we searched only for 2 values : 1 and 5 . Notably , we found that for all teacher-student pairs but ( T : WRN40_4 S : MobileNetV2 ) $ \\alpha=1 $ is the optimal value . Furthermore , on ImageNet , the optimal values were $ \\alpha=1 $ , $ \\beta=1 $ for all teacher-student pairs considered . We will add this information to the paper . $ \\textbf { Q3.4 } $ : The main idea ( `` softmax representation learning '' , or $ L_ { SR } $ ) is very simple and seems to be easily applied with other KD methods beyond FitNets method . Combining $ L_ { SR } $ with other KD methods ( e.g , AT , OFD , etc ) will verify the generalization and applicability of the proposed method . $ \\textbf { R3.4 } $ : In Table 10 , appendix A.2 , we already provide some results by combining our method with KD and AT . As it can be seen adding KD slightly hurts performance as expected . From the same table , we observe that AT provides very low improvements compared to our method and hence combining the two methods works worse than our method alone . As also suggested by you , during rebuttal time , we ran the experiment OFD+ours where we get : 75.90 , 79.17 , $ \\textbf { 79.39 } $ , 69,90 , 72.50 , 77.79 , $ \\textbf { 75.65 } $ , 71.56 , $ \\textbf { 71.96 } $ where bold indicates improvement over our method alone .

The idea is to utilize the teacher \u2019 s pre-trained classifier to train the student \u2019 s penultimate layer feature by adopting two losses : ( a ) the Feature Matching loss LFM and ( b ) the Softmax Regression loss LSR . The latter is designed to take into account the classification task at hand , which imposes that for the same input image , the teacher \u2019 s and student \u2019 s feature produce the same output when passed through the teacher \u2019 s pre-trained and frozen classifier . The whole idea is easy and clear . The authors also provided necessary experiments to rationalize the approach , for example , why the penultimate layer ? why student classifier not included ? The final model is thoroughly compared with state-of-the-arts knowledge distillation methods . Despite in several tasks , the proposed model fails to succeed the CRD method , given the simplicity of the proposed method and its superiority over most of the tasks , I think the results are satisfactory . Still , I would like to give a suggestion : 1 . After CRD , proposed in 2019 , there appears many new methods with refreshing performance .

The paper follows a different path to KD by proposing a self-supervised task whereas our method uses the more traditional supervised learning approach . Hence , we believe that the improvements reported in [ 1 ] could be complementary to ours . In fact , one of the deployed losses in [ 1 ] is standard KD which can be replaced by our method . So during rebuttal time we used the authors ' provided code [ 2 ] , and replaced $ L_ { KD } $ in Eq . ( 8 ) of [ 1 ] with our proposed losses $ L_ { FM } $ and $ L_ { SR } $ , and trained the following Teacher-Student pair ( T : WRN40_2 S : WRN16_2 ) on CIFAR-100 . We were able to obtain +0.43 % improvement .

Other than that whatever holds for $ L_ { SR-CE } $ also holds for $ L_ { SR-L2 } $ . $ \\textbf { Q2.4 } $ : In Eq 8 , I assume that a separate classifier is also trained for the student model using the $ L_ { CE } $ loss . How is the performance if we completely remove the student classifier ? That is , the student model only consists of a feature extractor , and during inference time , we directly insert the pre-trained teacher classifier on top of the student model . $ \\textbf { R2.4 } $ : Thank you for the suggestion , it is an interesting experiment that we did n't consider . On ImageNet , using ResNet34 as teacher , and ResNet18 as student , our paper \u2019 s result is 71.73 whereas using your suggestion gives 71.81 which is basically the same ."}, "1": {"review_id": "ZzwDy_wiWv-1", "review_text": "This paper propose to leverage the frozen classifier from the teacher model for training better representations for the student model .

So I encourage the authors to add a section to discuss it . $ \\textbf { R4.1 } $ : Most papers that we \u2019 re comparing with , including classic papers like KD [ 2 ] , AT [ 3 ] but also state-of-the-art methods like RKD [ 4 ] , PKT [ 5 ] , a Teacher is always available . Furthermore , we primarily focused on classification and all the papers we are comparing with are also focusing on classification problems . Furthermore , it is not clear how KD can be applied for regression tasks . This is because one of the key features of knowledge distillation is using the soft outputs of the teacher as supervisory signals for supervised learning which capture inter-class dependencies ( as opposed to using one-hot labels ) . For regression , there are no such signals as the network outputs the regressed values only . On the contrary , we can argue that since our method focuses on improving the penultimate layer 's output feature , it can be effective for regression tasks too . So , we did follow your advice and applied our method to a regression problem : facial landmark localisation . Given a facial image the task is to localise a set of facial landmarks in terms of ( x , y ) coordinates which can be solved by using a conv . net to directly regress the ( x , y ) coordinates of the facial landmarks . We used the WFLW [ 1 ] dataset , which is one of the hardest benchmarks for this task . Performance is measured in terms of Normalised Mean Error ( lower is better ) , the standard metric for the problem . In our experiment , we used a ResNet50 as the teacher and a ResNet8 as the student .

More specifically , representation learning , in our paper , refers to a training procedure which focuses on improving the representational capacity of the output of the penultimate layer of the student , i.e.the feature just before the student \u2019 s linear layer , denoted as $ h^S $ in our paper . 1 ) The term representation capacity refers to that feature ( $ h^S $ ) and not the final fully-connected layer ( projection matrix ) . This definition has been used widely in recent work on self-supervised learning [ 1 , 2 ] 2 ) Because the teacher 's projection matrix remains frozen , applying $ L_ { SR } $ loss is directly focusing on optimizing $ h^S $ .

The paper only shows empirical results where $ L_ { SR } $ works better than $ L_ { KD } $ . This argument is not easily accepted for me , so more theoretical backup is necessary . $ \\textbf { R3.2 } $ : Unfortunately , we do not have a theoretical justification for this claim . However , in addition to the improved accuracy results obtained by our method , we do have an experiment which provides further empirical evidence : Section 4 -- Transferability of representations , where we compare the representational power of the student \u2019 s feature $ h_s $ trained with KD and with our method . Clearly , our method can train a more powerful feature representation which generalizes better when employed on a different dataset ( trained on CIFAR ; tested on STL10 ) . $ \\textbf { Q3.3 } $ : Study on the hyper-parameter \u03b1 and \u03b2 on eq ( 8 ) is missing $ \\textbf { R3.3 } $ : Thank you for pointing this out , this was an omission . We did only a basic search to find the best hyper-parameters . First , we fix $ \\alpha $ and search for the best $ \\beta $ . Then , we used the best $ \\beta $ , and search for the best $ \\alpha $ . This is suboptimal compared to a full grid search over $ \\alpha $ and $ \\beta $ . Furthermore , we searched only for 2 values : 1 and 5 . Notably , we found that for all teacher-student pairs but ( T : WRN40_4 S : MobileNetV2 ) $ \\alpha=1 $ is the optimal value . Furthermore , on ImageNet , the optimal values were $ \\alpha=1 $ , $ \\beta=1 $ for all teacher-student pairs considered . We will add this information to the paper . $ \\textbf { Q3.4 } $ : The main idea ( `` softmax representation learning '' , or $ L_ { SR } $ ) is very simple and seems to be easily applied with other KD methods beyond FitNets method . Combining $ L_ { SR } $ with other KD methods ( e.g , AT , OFD , etc ) will verify the generalization and applicability of the proposed method . $ \\textbf { R3.4 } $ : In Table 10 , appendix A.2 , we already provide some results by combining our method with KD and AT . As it can be seen adding KD slightly hurts performance as expected . From the same table , we observe that AT provides very low improvements compared to our method and hence combining the two methods works worse than our method alone . As also suggested by you , during rebuttal time , we ran the experiment OFD+ours where we get : 75.90 , 79.17 , $ \\textbf { 79.39 } $ , 69,90 , 72.50 , 77.79 , $ \\textbf { 75.65 } $ , 71.56 , $ \\textbf { 71.96 } $ where bold indicates improvement over our method alone . This shows some promising direction , however a more comprehensive investigation is needed to fully realise the potential of combining the two methods together ."}, "3": {"review_id": "ZzwDy_wiWv-3", "review_text": "This paper proposed a novel method for knowledge distillation . The idea is to utilize the teacher \u2019 s pre-trained classifier to train the student \u2019 s penultimate layer feature by adopting two losses : ( a ) the Feature Matching loss LFM and ( b ) the Softmax Regression loss LSR . The latter is designed to take into account the classification task at hand , which imposes that for the same input image , the teacher \u2019 s and student \u2019 s feature produce the same output when passed through the teacher \u2019 s pre-trained and frozen classifier . The whole idea is easy and clear . The authors also provided necessary experiments to rationalize the approach , for example , why the penultimate layer ? why student classifier not included ? The final model is thoroughly compared with state-of-the-arts knowledge distillation methods . Despite in several tasks , the proposed model fails to succeed the CRD method , given the simplicity of the proposed method and its superiority over most of the tasks , I think the results are satisfactory . Still , I would like to give a suggestion : 1 . After CRD , proposed in 2019 , there appears many new methods with refreshing performance . For example , [ 1 ] Xu G , Liu Z , Li X , et al.Knowledge Distillation Meets Self-Supervision [ C ] . in ECCV 2020 .

The paper follows a different path to KD by proposing a self-supervised task whereas our method uses the more traditional supervised learning approach . Hence , we believe that the improvements reported in [ 1 ] could be complementary to ours . In fact , one of the deployed losses in [ 1 ] is standard KD which can be replaced by our method . So during rebuttal time we used the authors ' provided code [ 2 ] , and replaced $ L_ { KD } $ in Eq . ( 8 ) of [ 1 ] with our proposed losses $ L_ { FM } $ and $ L_ { SR } $ , and trained the following Teacher-Student pair ( T : WRN40_2 S : WRN16_2 ) on CIFAR-100 . We were able to obtain +0.43 % improvement . This result , which we are confident that can be further improved , is indicative of the effectiveness of the potential synergy between the two approaches . Finally , although we will of course discuss and cite the aforementioned paper , we would also like to bring up ICLR guidelines : `` if a paper was published on or after Aug 2 , 2020 , authors are not required to compare their own work to that paper .
