Our responses to all the comments are as follows . * * ( 1 ) Composition of the paper ( 5 pages of intro+prelim , 3 pages of technical contents ) * * We realized this is an unusual composition , but it is necessary for the following reason . This paper really requires a lot of background materials from Learning in Games , Dynamical Systems , Volume Analysis , and also some results from the two recent papers of Cheung and Piliouras ( COLT 2019 and NeurIPS 2020 ) . These materials are still new to most ML researchers . To make sure the paper is as self-contained as possible and can be accessible to the broad ML community , we made the difficult decision to spend five pages on intro+prelim . Even after this , we still had some materials which we could only shallowly cover due to page limit ; for them , we give pointers to Cheung and Piliouras , which provide more elaborate discussions . We understand some reviewers and readers are more eager to grasp the main contributions of our work , so we devoted roughly one page ( page 3 ) early in the paper to provide layman discussion about our main contributions . We will elaborate on this in Part ( 2 ) of this response . As an additional page is allowed , in the updated version of the paper , we add a conclusion section and enrich the paper with some experiments/graphical illuminations . This should make the paper composition more balanced . The conclusion section includes a discussion on the significance of this paper to the learning community and possible future directions , which we also discuss in Part ( 3 ) of this response . * * ( 2 ) `` Our Contributions '' * * We devoted one page ( page 3 ) to provide layman discussions about our main contributions . `` Our Contributions '' serves as a roadmap to understanding our results , which are stated from page 6 onwards . We admit that the insights are not there yet , but we did provide them at the beginning of Section 3.2 , which needs a key technical Lemma 4 . This is why the insights appear so late . To help with grasping our main contributions , we would like to provide a concise extract of `` Our Contributions '' : 1 . Previous Work We Base On : Our work is based on the previous two papers of Cheung and Piliouras ( COLT 2019 and NeurIPS 2020 ) , which showed that MWU and FTRL in two-person zero-sum games and Optimistic MWU ( OMWU ) in coordination games are Lyapunov chaotic everywhere in the payoff space . To show this , they use volume analysis . In brief , given an open ball of initial conditions , which has a positive Lebesgue measure ( volume ) , we analyze how the volume of the ball changes when it is evolved by the learning process . Cheung and Piliouras reduced volume analysis of MWU in general bimatrix game $ ( \\mathbf { A } , \\mathbf { B } ) $ to analyzing the sign of a function $ C_ { ( \\mathbf { A } , \\mathbf { B } ) } ( * ) $ , which is a technical starting point of our work . 2.Motivation : The previous papers of Cheung and Piliouras focus on special sub-families of games . But in Learning in Games , we are naturally motivated to understand what happens when MWU or OMWU are applied to * general * matrix games . 3.Insights : We provided some insights at the beginning of Section 3.2 . By Lemma 4 , we can decompose the function $ C_ { ( \\mathbf { A } , \\mathbf { B } ) } ( * ) $ neatly into zero-sum and coordination parts , which correspond to the strengths of volume-expansion and volume-contraction . Informally , when the zero-sum part is `` larger '' than the coordination part , we have volume-expansion ( and hence chaos ) almost everywhere . The comparison of `` largeness '' of the two parts are made via the notion of matrix domination ( Section 3.2.1 ) and the use of a linear program ( Section 3.2.2 ) . 4.Techniques/Tools : We brought up the main tools ( the direct-sum decomposition of a game into zero-sum and coordination components , trivial matrices , matrix domination , a linear program ) we use in the later stage of the paper . Their precise definitions and discussions appear from page 6 onwards . * * ( 3 ) How is the paper related to the learning community ? * * First of all , AnonReviewer3 provides a good answer for us . We surely want to avoid chaos in learning , so by understanding under what situations chaos can arise , we see when we should adjust or redesign our algorithm to counter against chaos . Studying learning in matrix ( normal-form ) games is a good theoretical starting point , since matrix game is among one of the most classical game models , and as our work and many previous works demonstrate , it admits mathematically amenable analyses . Having the above said , we are immensely interested in pursuing volume and chaos analyses on settings that are more relevant to applications in ML , e.g. , general GANs and differential games . We believe the techniques we use ( volume analysis , game decomposition , etc . ) can be applied ."}, {"review_id": "a3wKPZpGtCF-1", "review_text": "Summary : This paper studies Lyapunov chaos in learning algorithms for matrix games . It appears to extend earlier work by Cheung and Piliouras to more general-sum settings with the conclusion that in these more common settings the learning algorithms considered exhibit chaos .

We are happy to hear that you found `` the paper offers some interesting ideas '' , `` Theorem 7 is very interesting '' and `` the linear program is clever '' . About the structure of this response , we will first emphasize the key contributions in this paper in the next two paragraphs , followed by addressing the weaknesses you pointed out . We are hoping these can convince you that the paper has good contributions , and the weaknesses are properly fixed or clarified . Previous works have shown that in some special games or subfamilies of matrix games , learning algorithms ( e.g.MWU ) are chaotic , e.g.Cheung and Piliouras ( COLT 2019 and NeurIPS 2020 ) theoretically showed that MWU and FTRL in two-person zero-sum games and Optimistic MWU ( OMWU ) in coordination games are Lyapunov chaotic everywhere in the payoff space . In Learning in Games , we are naturally motivated to understand what happens when MWU or OMWU are applied to * general * matrix games . We vastly extend Cheung and Piliouras ' results by characterizing bimatrix games wherein MWU/OMWU is Lyapunov chaotic ( almost ) everywhere . Such bimatrix games are significantly broader than zero-sum and coordination games . The above key contribution is achieved via a couple of technical contributions that might inspire future works on chaos analyses of other learning systems . Based upon the volume analyses employed by Cheung and Piliouras , we spot the use of the canonical game decomposition into zero-sum and coordination components , which permit us to analyze the volume-effect of the two components independently . We also introduce a novel matrix domination notion , and the use of a linear program , which facilitate the characterizations . * * Answers to the weaknesses pointed out by Reviewer 4 * * > constantly referring to `` AI/ML '' - just pick one We were aiming to be more inclusive . We pick ML in the latest revision . > '' measurement errors in real economies '' - why `` economies '' all of a sudden ? We change it to `` errors in measuring payoffs '' . > '' Nash equilibrium is not achievable in general . '' - this is patently false . There is a wealth of recent literature on learning algorithms which stably approach Nash equilibria We agree that for zero-sum games , Nash equilibrium is not hard to compute . We are fully aware of the recent stream of `` momentum '' or `` extra-gradient '' methods which converge to Nash equilibrium of zero-sum game quickly . By `` Nash equilibrium is not achievable in general '' , we actually mean general matrix games , which are our focus here . In general , approximating Nash equilibrium is PPAD-hard for matrix games . This means that there should not exist a dynamic which converges to Nash equilibrium quickly ( i.e.in poly ( \\epsilon , # number of players , # number of strategies ) time ) . ( https : //arxiv.org/abs/1405.3322 ) > the whole motivation with roundoff errors reads very naive ... these issues have been studied for decades and are taught in standard courses on numerical methods . First , we thank for your pointers to the classics of Demmel and the great work about algorithmic stability . We would like to clarify the key messages in the paragraph that discusses round-off errors . Our central message is that round-off errors can lead to devastating outcomes , which echoes with the concepts of Lyapunov chaos and unpredictability very well . The target audience of this paragraph is to the broad ML researchers . There is no doubt that researchers working primarily on numerical methods know of the issue very well ( so the paragraph might seem naive to them ) , but we believe the issue does not receive much attention among ML researchers as it should be . To convince ML researchers that this is a legitimate concern , we quoted the example from Ali Rahimi about the learning system , so that ML readers can feel the proximity of the issue . We also relate chaos with the concepts of unpredictability and irreproducibility , which ML researchers are more familiar with . > I do not follow footnote 1 In Game Theory , different solution concepts arise from various backgrounds . Nash equilibrium is a classical solution concept in Game Theory . From a learning perspective , it is often a fixed point of learning dynamics . But as one of our answers above ( the PPAD one ) suggest , Nash equilibrium can not be quickly achieved in general . Thus , researchers have come up with some weaker solution concepts -- coarse correlated equilibrium is one of them . It is known that many online-optimization algorithms are no-regret , and their time averages do converge to a coarsely correlated equilibrium . In the footnote , we were using the term `` no-regret algorithms '' instead of `` online-optimization algorithms '' . This seems to make the optimization vs. dynamical-systemic perspectives less transparent , so we have switched to the latter term .

We hope the following response can fully address your comments . Please let us know if you have any further comments . > It would be better to explain the logic behind $ C_ { ( \\mathbf { A } , \\mathbf { B } ) } $ more intuitively , ....... '' We agree that it is better to explain the logic behind $ C_ { ( \\mathbf { A } , \\mathbf { B } ) } $ more intuitively . Intuitively , $ C_ { ( \\mathbf { A } , \\mathbf { B } ) } $ can be viewed as the strength of volume expansion for MWU dynamics in the bimatrix game $ ( \\mathbf { A } , \\mathbf { B } ) $ . For two-player zero-sum game $ ( \\mathbf { A } , \\mathbf { -A } ) $ , $ C_ { ( \\mathbf { A } , \\mathbf { -A } ) } $ is always positive , which means that the MWU dynamics will always expand the volume in the cumulative payoff space . The more positive the $ C_ { ( \\mathbf { A } , \\mathbf { B } ) } $ is , the quicker the expansion is . In contrast , for two-player coordination game $ ( \\mathbf { A } , \\mathbf { A } ) $ , $ C_ { ( \\mathbf { A } , \\mathbf { A } ) } $ is always negative , which means the volume will contract when using the MWU dynamics . In this paper , we prove that the $ C_ { ( \\mathbf { A } , \\mathbf { B } ) } $ in general two-player game is the summation of C ( the zero-sum part of the game ) and C ( the coordination part of the game ) . Intuitively , if the absolute value of C of the zero-sum part is bigger than the absolute value of C of the coordination part , then the value of C of the general game $ ( \\mathbf { A } , \\mathbf { B } ) $ will be positive , and this means the MWU dynamic will expand the volume in this game . We 'd like to refer you to the two recent papers of Cheung and Piliouras ( COLT 2019 and NeurIPS 2020 ) for more technical details . Due to the page limit , it is unfortunately hard to include much of the intuitions above , as we already spent 5.2 pages explaining the background materials , and trying to make sure the paper is as self-contained as possible and can be accessible to the broad ML community . > Could you comment on the games whose dynamic can not be determined by matrix domination or linear program ? For games which can not be characterized by matrix domination or linear program , the volume-changing behavior is not that clear-cut . MWU dynamics will expand volume in some regions of the cumulative payoff space , but it will contract volume in the remaining regions . We raise a simple example . Consider a 4x4 bimatrix game , where the top-left 2x2 subgame is a zero-sum , the bottom-right 2x2 subgame is a coordination game , and the top-right and bottom-left subgames are zero games ( payoff zero to both players ) . If both players choose their first two strategies with high probability , then volume expands around that point , as the players are essentially playing a zero-sum game . Analogously , if both players choose their last two strategies with high probability , then volume contracts around that point . In general , given the zero-sum component ( Z , -Z ) and coordination component ( C , C ) of a general game , it is possible to identify regions wherein volume expands . To see why , note that volume expands in the region { ( p , q ) | C_ { ( Z , -Z ) } ( p , q ) + C_ { ( C , C ) } ( p , q ) > 0 } . The condition can be simplified to C_ { ( Z , -Z ) } ( p , q ) - C_ { ( C , -C ) } ( p , q ) > 0 , which allows us to use Observation 8 to find out these ( p , q ) . In some cases , it is possible to identify a large subset of this region , so we can conclude that chaos occurs in this large subset . ( An example is generalized Rock-Paper-Scissors games , see Section 7 of Cheung and Piliouras COLT 2019 paper arxiv version at https : //arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08396.pdf . ) > For the games that could appear in the DL applications , e.g. , GAN , could those games ' dynamic be determined by matrix domination or linear program ? If not , shall we expect them to have chaos phenomena or not ? `` Does chaos occur in GAN ? '' is an interesting open problem . AnonReviewer3 has pointed out a reference ( UMass Thesis 2018 ) , which has some empirical evidence that chaos can occur ( at least locally ) with GAN . It is usually easy to show that Lyapunov chaos occurs locally ( which boils down to analyzing the eigenvalues of Jacobian at a given point ) . We believe it will be interesting to see if chaos can occur in a widespread domain , just as what we showed in the cumulative payoff domain for a large family of matrix games . About the usefulness of game decomposition , matrix domination or linear program in showing chaos in other games , we frankly do not have a good answer at this moment . But this is definitely a good future direction to look into . To shed light on this , we will first need to know better of the mathematical structure of the other games . We believe that for differential games and multi-player games , the game decompositions proposed in Candogan et al . ( Flows and decompositions of games : Harmonic and potential games. , MOR 2011 ) and Letcher et al . ( Differentiable game mechanics. , JMLR 2019 ) might play a role in chaos analyses . For other games like GANs , as we are not familiar with its mathematical structure , we dare not to comment ."}, {"review_id": "a3wKPZpGtCF-3", "review_text": "This paper provides tools for classifying the payoff dynamics in general-sum n-player games as Lyapunov chaotic assuming three common algorithms are used : multiplicative weights update ( FTRL with entropy regularizer ) , optimistic MWU , and FTRL with L2 regularizer . Previous work ( Cheung & Piliouras ) showed that the existence of Lyapunov chaos in the dual space is indicated by the sign of a function C of the game . This work shows that this function can be decomposed into a sum : C of the zero-sum part + C of the coordination part . They also show how to use trivial matrices ( which do n't affect C ) to further reduce parts of the game in a way that eases the analysis . As part of their analysis , they prove that the set of bi-matrix games exhibiting chaos has positive Lebesgue measure and discuss how the relative strength of the zero-sum and coordination parts determines the ultimate sign of C. Overall , I think this is a solid paper and should be accepted . The work is original and significant . The paper could benefit from additional discussion and explanation of the claims ( see below ) so that the paper is more self-contained .

The authors state `` eigenvalues of the local Jacobian characterizes chaotic behaviors '' . To my knowledge , no linear dynamical system would be said to exhibit chaos . Maybe a sentence or two early on can put to rest a reader 's confusion if they already have some background in nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory . The authors prove chaos in the dual space ( which is unbounded ) , but do not formally relate this to chaos in the primal space ( which is bounded ) . It is stated , `` This can be shown to imply instability in the mixed strategy ( primal ) space . '' Can the authors provide some explanation or intuition so this part of the paper is more self-contained ? It seems like `` chaos '' according to Def 1 in the dual space is not too surprising because we 're measuring divergence of a cumulating function ( which naturally defines growth ) . Why does the sign of C matter ? Can you explain where this Eqn comes from ? Can you provide any intuition or must we read the Cheung & Piliouras ( 2020 ) ? Similar to above , it would be best if this part of the paper was more self-contained . Quality : The work is of high quality . I did not check the proofs in the appendix , but those in the main body look correct ( Lemma 4 is correct ) . Clarity : The paper is mostly clear , however , I have some questions regarding the definition of chaos ( see above ) and how to interpret chaos in the dual space in terms of the primal space ( which I think we care about more ) . Originality : This work is substantially original . Showing C can be decomposed into a sum of the zero-sum part and coordination part is novel . Also , the tools for removing trivial matrices and bounding C using the output of a linear program is new ( assuming we can identify the right trivial matrix ) . Lastly , proving chaos is `` common '' is original . Significance : Proving chaos is common in games is significant because it means we have to adjust our algorithm design to account for it . Providing tools for determining whether a game exhibits chaos for popular algorithms can tell us whether to redesign the algorithm for that game or to adjust the game in some way . Minor : I would suggest backing off the statement that `` Understanding chaos is an important but long-ignored aspect of AI/ML '' . Maybe say it has not received as much attention as it should . A few works come to mind . No need to cite necessarily . - A RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK WITHOUT CHAOS ( ICLR 2017 ) . - Exponential expressivity in deep neural networks through transient chaos ( NIPS 2016 ) . - FROM OPTIMIZATION TO EQUILIBRATION : UNDERSTANDING AN EMERGING PARADIGM IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING ( UMass Thesis 2018 , Section 5.7 ) ; approximates the Lyapunov exponents of GANs to identify chaos . `` We answer the above question affirmatively '' . Instead of `` How does ... '' , say `` Does the ... '' so that the question admits a yes/no response . `` \u2013The second technique '' - remove the dash . `` of a multi-player potential games '' - game singular . `` mixed strategy space of dimension n '' - the simplex defined with n-probabilities is ( n-1 ) -dimensional . Explain $ \\mathbb { E } [ A_ { jk } ] = \\mathbb { E } [ A_j ] = \\mathbb { E } [ A_k ] $ . This is not obvious to me , and in fact , appears trivially false so I 'm probably misunderstanding your notation . I can easily construct an A matrix and mixed strategy y such that this does not hold . Maybe say $ u=v= [ 2 , 0 , 2 ] $ to construct the trivial matrix in the Simple Example . Use logical and `` $ \\land $ '' maybe instead of $ \\texttt { and } $ in Section 3.2 . Def 4 looks like the magnitude of the determinant of the elementwise log of a matrix . I just thought I 'd share . I 'm not sure if there 's anything there , but determinant pops up in volume analysis as you know and the matrices can represent exponential expansion so the log maybe makes sense by a very hand-wavy connection . `` it is easy to see that there is quite many games '' - are quite many `` zero-sum part $ \\theta $ -dominate '' - dominates Can you provide a constructive way to discover the trivial matrix defined by $ g_j $ and $ h_k $ in Eqn 8 ? Or in general ?", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "reply_text": "First of all , we thank for your detailed and supportive review . In particular , we thank for the pointers to works about chaos in ML , which do provide us some useful materials to look into for future work . We address your comments as below . > Definition of Chaos and Interpretation of Results in Primal Space : Would n't the system $ dx/dt = x $ with $ x ( t ) = e^t $ satisfy Def 1 ? In other words , any $ dx/dt = Ax $ with $ A\\succ 0 $ is this better characterized as divergent ? First , about linear dynamical system , you are definitely right that $ A\\succ 0 $ implies diverging trajectories , but by convention they are usually not said to be chaotic , since they admit `` closed-form '' solution . Having closed-form solution is very rare for non-linear dynamical systems though . > Should n't it be required that $ \\phi ( t , B ) $ remains inside $ \\mathcal { O } $ for all time ? By inspection , the Lorenz system seems to satisfy this . The authors state `` eigenvalues of the local Jacobian characterizes chaotic behaviors '' . To my knowledge , no linear dynamical system would be said to exhibit chaos . Maybe a sentence or two early on can put to rest a reader 's confusion if they already have some background in nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory . About `` $ \\phi ( t , B ) $ should remains inside $ \\mathcal { O } $ for all time '' , you are right that it is the standard way for definition . Cheung and Piliouras had implicitly fine-tuned the standard definition to fit the special need for their analyses . The reason for this fine-tuning is because when $ \\mathcal { O } $ is unbounded , the volume-changing behavior in a region that is far away from the starting point can be expanding but with diminishing rate . Thus , to show that the volume is increasing substantially and exponentially fast , we have to confine the definition of chaos in a bounded set this is how the definition of `` Lyapunov chaotic everywhere '' in Def 1 is made . But when $ \\mathcal { O } $ is bounded , the exponential volume expansion clearly can not go on forever , and that 's why in Def 1 the standard condition `` $ \\phi ( t , B ) $ should remains inside $ \\mathcal { O } $ for all time '' is removed . The fine-tuned definition of Lyapunov chaos can be used to derive some surprising negative properties of MWU in zero-sum games ( see Cheung and Piliouras NeurIPS 2020 paper ) , so we believe it is a notion of Lyapunov chaos that worth pursuing in the context of learning in games . > The authors prove chaos in the dual space ( which is unbounded ) , but do not formally relate this to chaos in the primal space ( which is bounded ) .

It seems like `` chaos '' according to Def 1 in the dual space is not too surprising because we 're measuring divergence of a cumulating function ( which naturally defines growth ) . We are happy to answer this . We agree that the divergence of the cumulating functions is not too surprising . Yet , the divergence in Def 1 is * exponential * , which is far from a triviality . For the formal relation between chaos in dual space and instability in primal space , Cheung and Piliouras ( NeurIPS 2020 ) have made this in their Proposition 2 ( page 5 of https : //arxiv.org/pdf/2005.13996.pdf ) . Intuitively , if all players use the mixed strategies in $ S^ { \\delta } $ , which the probability of every strategy is at least $ \\delta $ ( i.e.the probability is bounded away from zero ) , then we can see the cumulative payoffs of all strategies grow at most linearly , which implies the growth of the volume in the dual space is at most polynomial . So , if the dual set corresponding to $ S^ { \\delta } $ has exponential volume expansion , then a set that lies in $ S^ { \\delta } $ initially will finally escape $ S^ { \\delta } $ . Further discussions on the relation between dual and primal spaces can be found in Appendix A of their paper ( Cheung and Piliouras ( NeurIPS 2020 ) ) . > Why does the sign of C matter ? Can you explain where this Eqn comes from ? ...... The function C was derived by Cheung and Piliouras ( COLT 2019 ) . We gave an explanation in page 5 : the sign ( of C ) determines the local volume-changing behavior around the point ( p , q ) when MWU is used . Thus , when C ( p , q ) is positive , the MWU dynamic around the point ( p , q ) is volume-expanding , while negative C ( p , q ) implies volume contraction around ( p , q ) .

Our responses to all the comments are as follows . * * ( 1 ) Composition of the paper ( 5 pages of intro+prelim , 3 pages of technical contents ) * * We realized this is an unusual composition , but it is necessary for the following reason . This paper really requires a lot of background materials from Learning in Games , Dynamical Systems , Volume Analysis , and also some results from the two recent papers of Cheung and Piliouras ( COLT 2019 and NeurIPS 2020 ) . These materials are still new to most ML researchers . To make sure the paper is as self-contained as possible and can be accessible to the broad ML community , we made the difficult decision to spend five pages on intro+prelim . Even after this , we still had some materials which we could only shallowly cover due to page limit ; for them , we give pointers to Cheung and Piliouras , which provide more elaborate discussions . We understand some reviewers and readers are more eager to grasp the main contributions of our work , so we devoted roughly one page ( page 3 ) early in the paper to provide layman discussion about our main contributions . We will elaborate on this in Part ( 2 ) of this response . As an additional page is allowed , in the updated version of the paper , we add a conclusion section and enrich the paper with some experiments/graphical illuminations . This should make the paper composition more balanced . The conclusion section includes a discussion on the significance of this paper to the learning community and possible future directions , which we also discuss in Part ( 3 ) of this response . * * ( 2 ) `` Our Contributions '' * * We devoted one page ( page 3 ) to provide layman discussions about our main contributions . `` Our Contributions '' serves as a roadmap to understanding our results , which are stated from page 6 onwards . We admit that the insights are not there yet , but we did provide them at the beginning of Section 3.2 , which needs a key technical Lemma 4 . This is why the insights appear so late . To help with grasping our main contributions , we would like to provide a concise extract of `` Our Contributions '' : 1 . Previous Work We Base On : Our work is based on the previous two papers of Cheung and Piliouras ( COLT 2019 and NeurIPS 2020 ) , which showed that MWU and FTRL in two-person zero-sum games and Optimistic MWU ( OMWU ) in coordination games are Lyapunov chaotic everywhere in the payoff space . To show this , they use volume analysis . In brief , given an open ball of initial conditions , which has a positive Lebesgue measure ( volume ) , we analyze how the volume of the ball changes when it is evolved by the learning process . Cheung and Piliouras reduced volume analysis of MWU in general bimatrix game $ ( \\mathbf { A } , \\mathbf { B } ) $ to analyzing the sign of a function $ C_ { ( \\mathbf { A } , \\mathbf { B } ) } ( * ) $ , which is a technical starting point of our work . 2.Motivation : The previous papers of Cheung and Piliouras focus on special sub-families of games . But in Learning in Games , we are naturally motivated to understand what happens when MWU or OMWU are applied to * general * matrix games . 3.Insights : We provided some insights at the beginning of Section 3.2 . By Lemma 4 , we can decompose the function $ C_ { ( \\mathbf { A } , \\mathbf { B } ) } ( * ) $ neatly into zero-sum and coordination parts , which correspond to the strengths of volume-expansion and volume-contraction . Informally , when the zero-sum part is `` larger '' than the coordination part , we have volume-expansion ( and hence chaos ) almost everywhere . The comparison of `` largeness '' of the two parts are made via the notion of matrix domination ( Section 3.2.1 ) and the use of a linear program ( Section 3.2.2 ) . 4.Techniques/Tools : We brought up the main tools ( the direct-sum decomposition of a game into zero-sum and coordination components , trivial matrices , matrix domination , a linear program ) we use in the later stage of the paper . Their precise definitions and discussions appear from page 6 onwards . * * ( 3 ) How is the paper related to the learning community ? * * First of all , AnonReviewer3 provides a good answer for us . We surely want to avoid chaos in learning , so by understanding under what situations chaos can arise , we see when we should adjust or redesign our algorithm to counter against chaos . Studying learning in matrix ( normal-form ) games is a good theoretical starting point , since matrix game is among one of the most classical game models , and as our work and many previous works demonstrate , it admits mathematically amenable analyses . Having the above said , we are immensely interested in pursuing volume and chaos analyses on settings that are more relevant to applications in ML , e.g. , general GANs and differential games . We believe the techniques we use ( volume analysis , game decomposition , etc . ) can be applied ."}, "1": {"review_id": "a3wKPZpGtCF-1", "review_text": "Summary : This paper studies Lyapunov chaos in learning algorithms for matrix games . It appears to extend earlier work by Cheung and Piliouras to more general-sum settings with the conclusion that in these more common settings the learning algorithms considered exhibit chaos .

We are happy to hear that you found `` the paper offers some interesting ideas '' , `` Theorem 7 is very interesting '' and `` the linear program is clever '' . About the structure of this response , we will first emphasize the key contributions in this paper in the next two paragraphs , followed by addressing the weaknesses you pointed out . We are hoping these can convince you that the paper has good contributions , and the weaknesses are properly fixed or clarified . Previous works have shown that in some special games or subfamilies of matrix games , learning algorithms ( e.g.MWU ) are chaotic , e.g.Cheung and Piliouras ( COLT 2019 and NeurIPS 2020 ) theoretically showed that MWU and FTRL in two-person zero-sum games and Optimistic MWU ( OMWU ) in coordination games are Lyapunov chaotic everywhere in the payoff space . In Learning in Games , we are naturally motivated to understand what happens when MWU or OMWU are applied to * general * matrix games . We vastly extend Cheung and Piliouras ' results by characterizing bimatrix games wherein MWU/OMWU is Lyapunov chaotic ( almost ) everywhere . Such bimatrix games are significantly broader than zero-sum and coordination games . The above key contribution is achieved via a couple of technical contributions that might inspire future works on chaos analyses of other learning systems . Based upon the volume analyses employed by Cheung and Piliouras , we spot the use of the canonical game decomposition into zero-sum and coordination components , which permit us to analyze the volume-effect of the two components independently . We also introduce a novel matrix domination notion , and the use of a linear program , which facilitate the characterizations . * * Answers to the weaknesses pointed out by Reviewer 4 * * > constantly referring to `` AI/ML '' - just pick one We were aiming to be more inclusive . We pick ML in the latest revision . > '' measurement errors in real economies '' - why `` economies '' all of a sudden ? We change it to `` errors in measuring payoffs '' . > '' Nash equilibrium is not achievable in general . '' - this is patently false . There is a wealth of recent literature on learning algorithms which stably approach Nash equilibria We agree that for zero-sum games , Nash equilibrium is not hard to compute . We are fully aware of the recent stream of `` momentum '' or `` extra-gradient '' methods which converge to Nash equilibrium of zero-sum game quickly . By `` Nash equilibrium is not achievable in general '' , we actually mean general matrix games , which are our focus here . In general , approximating Nash equilibrium is PPAD-hard for matrix games . This means that there should not exist a dynamic which converges to Nash equilibrium quickly ( i.e.in poly ( \\epsilon , # number of players , # number of strategies ) time ) . ( https : //arxiv.org/abs/1405.3322 ) > the whole motivation with roundoff errors reads very naive ... these issues have been studied for decades and are taught in standard courses on numerical methods . First , we thank for your pointers to the classics of Demmel and the great work about algorithmic stability . We would like to clarify the key messages in the paragraph that discusses round-off errors . Our central message is that round-off errors can lead to devastating outcomes , which echoes with the concepts of Lyapunov chaos and unpredictability very well . The target audience of this paragraph is to the broad ML researchers . There is no doubt that researchers working primarily on numerical methods know of the issue very well ( so the paragraph might seem naive to them ) , but we believe the issue does not receive much attention among ML researchers as it should be . To convince ML researchers that this is a legitimate concern , we quoted the example from Ali Rahimi about the learning system , so that ML readers can feel the proximity of the issue . We also relate chaos with the concepts of unpredictability and irreproducibility , which ML researchers are more familiar with . > I do not follow footnote 1 In Game Theory , different solution concepts arise from various backgrounds . Nash equilibrium is a classical solution concept in Game Theory . From a learning perspective , it is often a fixed point of learning dynamics . But as one of our answers above ( the PPAD one ) suggest , Nash equilibrium can not be quickly achieved in general . Thus , researchers have come up with some weaker solution concepts -- coarse correlated equilibrium is one of them . It is known that many online-optimization algorithms are no-regret , and their time averages do converge to a coarsely correlated equilibrium . In the footnote , we were using the term `` no-regret algorithms '' instead of `` online-optimization algorithms '' . This seems to make the optimization vs. dynamical-systemic perspectives less transparent , so we have switched to the latter term .

We hope the following response can fully address your comments . Please let us know if you have any further comments . > It would be better to explain the logic behind $ C_ { ( \\mathbf { A } , \\mathbf { B } ) } $ more intuitively , ....... '' We agree that it is better to explain the logic behind $ C_ { ( \\mathbf { A } , \\mathbf { B } ) } $ more intuitively . Intuitively , $ C_ { ( \\mathbf { A } , \\mathbf { B } ) } $ can be viewed as the strength of volume expansion for MWU dynamics in the bimatrix game $ ( \\mathbf { A } , \\mathbf { B } ) $ . For two-player zero-sum game $ ( \\mathbf { A } , \\mathbf { -A } ) $ , $ C_ { ( \\mathbf { A } , \\mathbf { -A } ) } $ is always positive , which means that the MWU dynamics will always expand the volume in the cumulative payoff space . The more positive the $ C_ { ( \\mathbf { A } , \\mathbf { B } ) } $ is , the quicker the expansion is . In contrast , for two-player coordination game $ ( \\mathbf { A } , \\mathbf { A } ) $ , $ C_ { ( \\mathbf { A } , \\mathbf { A } ) } $ is always negative , which means the volume will contract when using the MWU dynamics . In this paper , we prove that the $ C_ { ( \\mathbf { A } , \\mathbf { B } ) } $ in general two-player game is the summation of C ( the zero-sum part of the game ) and C ( the coordination part of the game ) . Intuitively , if the absolute value of C of the zero-sum part is bigger than the absolute value of C of the coordination part , then the value of C of the general game $ ( \\mathbf { A } , \\mathbf { B } ) $ will be positive , and this means the MWU dynamic will expand the volume in this game . We 'd like to refer you to the two recent papers of Cheung and Piliouras ( COLT 2019 and NeurIPS 2020 ) for more technical details . Due to the page limit , it is unfortunately hard to include much of the intuitions above , as we already spent 5.2 pages explaining the background materials , and trying to make sure the paper is as self-contained as possible and can be accessible to the broad ML community . > Could you comment on the games whose dynamic can not be determined by matrix domination or linear program ? For games which can not be characterized by matrix domination or linear program , the volume-changing behavior is not that clear-cut . MWU dynamics will expand volume in some regions of the cumulative payoff space , but it will contract volume in the remaining regions . We raise a simple example . Consider a 4x4 bimatrix game , where the top-left 2x2 subgame is a zero-sum , the bottom-right 2x2 subgame is a coordination game , and the top-right and bottom-left subgames are zero games ( payoff zero to both players ) . If both players choose their first two strategies with high probability , then volume expands around that point , as the players are essentially playing a zero-sum game . Analogously , if both players choose their last two strategies with high probability , then volume contracts around that point . In general , given the zero-sum component ( Z , -Z ) and coordination component ( C , C ) of a general game , it is possible to identify regions wherein volume expands . To see why , note that volume expands in the region { ( p , q ) | C_ { ( Z , -Z ) } ( p , q ) + C_ { ( C , C ) } ( p , q ) > 0 } . The condition can be simplified to C_ { ( Z , -Z ) } ( p , q ) - C_ { ( C , -C ) } ( p , q ) > 0 , which allows us to use Observation 8 to find out these ( p , q ) . In some cases , it is possible to identify a large subset of this region , so we can conclude that chaos occurs in this large subset . ( An example is generalized Rock-Paper-Scissors games , see Section 7 of Cheung and Piliouras COLT 2019 paper arxiv version at https : //arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08396.pdf . ) > For the games that could appear in the DL applications , e.g. , GAN , could those games ' dynamic be determined by matrix domination or linear program ? If not , shall we expect them to have chaos phenomena or not ? `` Does chaos occur in GAN ? '' is an interesting open problem . AnonReviewer3 has pointed out a reference ( UMass Thesis 2018 ) , which has some empirical evidence that chaos can occur ( at least locally ) with GAN . It is usually easy to show that Lyapunov chaos occurs locally ( which boils down to analyzing the eigenvalues of Jacobian at a given point ) . We believe it will be interesting to see if chaos can occur in a widespread domain , just as what we showed in the cumulative payoff domain for a large family of matrix games . About the usefulness of game decomposition , matrix domination or linear program in showing chaos in other games , we frankly do not have a good answer at this moment . But this is definitely a good future direction to look into . To shed light on this , we will first need to know better of the mathematical structure of the other games . We believe that for differential games and multi-player games , the game decompositions proposed in Candogan et al . ( Flows and decompositions of games : Harmonic and potential games. , MOR 2011 ) and Letcher et al . ( Differentiable game mechanics. , JMLR 2019 ) might play a role in chaos analyses . For other games like GANs , as we are not familiar with its mathematical structure , we dare not to comment ."}, "3": {"review_id": "a3wKPZpGtCF-3", "review_text": "This paper provides tools for classifying the payoff dynamics in general-sum n-player games as Lyapunov chaotic assuming three common algorithms are used : multiplicative weights update ( FTRL with entropy regularizer ) , optimistic MWU , and FTRL with L2 regularizer . Previous work ( Cheung & Piliouras ) showed that the existence of Lyapunov chaos in the dual space is indicated by the sign of a function C of the game . This work shows that this function can be decomposed into a sum : C of the zero-sum part + C of the coordination part . They also show how to use trivial matrices ( which do n't affect C ) to further reduce parts of the game in a way that eases the analysis . As part of their analysis , they prove that the set of bi-matrix games exhibiting chaos has positive Lebesgue measure and discuss how the relative strength of the zero-sum and coordination parts determines the ultimate sign of C. Overall , I think this is a solid paper and should be accepted . The work is original and significant . The paper could benefit from additional discussion and explanation of the claims ( see below ) so that the paper is more self-contained . Definition of Chaos and Interpretation of Results in Primal Space : Would n't the system $ \\frac { dx } { dt } = x $ with $ x ( t ) = e^t $ satisfy Def 1 ? In other words , any $ \\dot { x } = Ax $ with $ A \\succ 0 $ Is this better characterized as divergent ? Should n't it be required that $ \\phi ( t , B ) $ remains inside $ \\mathcal { O } $ for all time ? By inspection , the Lorenz system seems to satisfy this . The authors state `` eigenvalues of the local Jacobian characterizes chaotic behaviors '' . To my knowledge , no linear dynamical system would be said to exhibit chaos . Maybe a sentence or two early on can put to rest a reader 's confusion if they already have some background in nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory . The authors prove chaos in the dual space ( which is unbounded ) , but do not formally relate this to chaos in the primal space ( which is bounded ) . It is stated , `` This can be shown to imply instability in the mixed strategy ( primal ) space . '' Can the authors provide some explanation or intuition so this part of the paper is more self-contained ? It seems like `` chaos '' according to Def 1 in the dual space is not too surprising because we 're measuring divergence of a cumulating function ( which naturally defines growth ) . Why does the sign of C matter ? Can you explain where this Eqn comes from ? Can you provide any intuition or must we read the Cheung & Piliouras ( 2020 ) ? Similar to above , it would be best if this part of the paper was more self-contained . Quality : The work is of high quality . I did not check the proofs in the appendix , but those in the main body look correct ( Lemma 4 is correct ) . Clarity : The paper is mostly clear , however , I have some questions regarding the definition of chaos ( see above ) and how to interpret chaos in the dual space in terms of the primal space ( which I think we care about more ) . Originality : This work is substantially original . Showing C can be decomposed into a sum of the zero-sum part and coordination part is novel . Also , the tools for removing trivial matrices and bounding C using the output of a linear program is new ( assuming we can identify the right trivial matrix ) . Lastly , proving chaos is `` common '' is original . Significance : Proving chaos is common in games is significant because it means we have to adjust our algorithm design to account for it . Providing tools for determining whether a game exhibits chaos for popular algorithms can tell us whether to redesign the algorithm for that game or to adjust the game in some way . Minor : I would suggest backing off the statement that `` Understanding chaos is an important but long-ignored aspect of AI/ML '' . Maybe say it has not received as much attention as it should . A few works come to mind . No need to cite necessarily . - A RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK WITHOUT CHAOS ( ICLR 2017 ) . - Exponential expressivity in deep neural networks through transient chaos ( NIPS 2016 ) . - FROM OPTIMIZATION TO EQUILIBRATION : UNDERSTANDING AN EMERGING PARADIGM IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING ( UMass Thesis 2018 , Section 5.7 ) ; approximates the Lyapunov exponents of GANs to identify chaos . `` We answer the above question affirmatively '' . Instead of `` How does ... '' , say `` Does the ... '' so that the question admits a yes/no response . `` \u2013The second technique '' - remove the dash . `` of a multi-player potential games '' - game singular . `` mixed strategy space of dimension n '' - the simplex defined with n-probabilities is ( n-1 ) -dimensional . Explain $ \\mathbb { E } [ A_ { jk } ] = \\mathbb { E } [ A_j ] = \\mathbb { E } [ A_k ] $ . This is not obvious to me , and in fact , appears trivially false so I 'm probably misunderstanding your notation . I can easily construct an A matrix and mixed strategy y such that this does not hold . Maybe say $ u=v= [ 2 , 0 , 2 ] $ to construct the trivial matrix in the Simple Example . Use logical and `` $ \\land $ '' maybe instead of $ \\texttt { and } $ in Section 3.2 . Def 4 looks like the magnitude of the determinant of the elementwise log of a matrix . I just thought I 'd share . I 'm not sure if there 's anything there , but determinant pops up in volume analysis as you know and the matrices can represent exponential expansion so the log maybe makes sense by a very hand-wavy connection . `` it is easy to see that there is quite many games '' - are quite many `` zero-sum part $ \\theta $ -dominate '' - dominates Can you provide a constructive way to discover the trivial matrix defined by $ g_j $ and $ h_k $ in Eqn 8 ? Or in general ?", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "reply_text": "First of all , we thank for your detailed and supportive review . In particular , we thank for the pointers to works about chaos in ML , which do provide us some useful materials to look into for future work . We address your comments as below . > Definition of Chaos and Interpretation of Results in Primal Space : Would n't the system $ dx/dt = x $ with $ x ( t ) = e^t $ satisfy Def 1 ? In other words , any $ dx/dt = Ax $ with $ A\\succ 0 $ is this better characterized as divergent ? First , about linear dynamical system , you are definitely right that $ A\\succ 0 $ implies diverging trajectories , but by convention they are usually not said to be chaotic , since they admit `` closed-form '' solution . Having closed-form solution is very rare for non-linear dynamical systems though . > Should n't it be required that $ \\phi ( t , B ) $ remains inside $ \\mathcal { O } $ for all time ? By inspection , the Lorenz system seems to satisfy this . The authors state `` eigenvalues of the local Jacobian characterizes chaotic behaviors '' . To my knowledge , no linear dynamical system would be said to exhibit chaos . Maybe a sentence or two early on can put to rest a reader 's confusion if they already have some background in nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory . About `` $ \\phi ( t , B ) $ should remains inside $ \\mathcal { O } $ for all time '' , you are right that it is the standard way for definition . Cheung and Piliouras had implicitly fine-tuned the standard definition to fit the special need for their analyses . The reason for this fine-tuning is because when $ \\mathcal { O } $ is unbounded , the volume-changing behavior in a region that is far away from the starting point can be expanding but with diminishing rate . Thus , to show that the volume is increasing substantially and exponentially fast , we have to confine the definition of chaos in a bounded set this is how the definition of `` Lyapunov chaotic everywhere '' in Def 1 is made . But when $ \\mathcal { O } $ is bounded , the exponential volume expansion clearly can not go on forever , and that 's why in Def 1 the standard condition `` $ \\phi ( t , B ) $ should remains inside $ \\mathcal { O } $ for all time '' is removed . The fine-tuned definition of Lyapunov chaos can be used to derive some surprising negative properties of MWU in zero-sum games ( see Cheung and Piliouras NeurIPS 2020 paper ) , so we believe it is a notion of Lyapunov chaos that worth pursuing in the context of learning in games . > The authors prove chaos in the dual space ( which is unbounded ) , but do not formally relate this to chaos in the primal space ( which is bounded ) .

It seems like `` chaos '' according to Def 1 in the dual space is not too surprising because we 're measuring divergence of a cumulating function ( which naturally defines growth ) . We are happy to answer this . We agree that the divergence of the cumulating functions is not too surprising . Yet , the divergence in Def 1 is * exponential * , which is far from a triviality . For the formal relation between chaos in dual space and instability in primal space , Cheung and Piliouras ( NeurIPS 2020 ) have made this in their Proposition 2 ( page 5 of https : //arxiv.org/pdf/2005.13996.pdf ) . Intuitively , if all players use the mixed strategies in $ S^ { \\delta } $ , which the probability of every strategy is at least $ \\delta $ ( i.e.the probability is bounded away from zero ) , then we can see the cumulative payoffs of all strategies grow at most linearly , which implies the growth of the volume in the dual space is at most polynomial . So , if the dual set corresponding to $ S^ { \\delta } $ has exponential volume expansion , then a set that lies in $ S^ { \\delta } $ initially will finally escape $ S^ { \\delta } $ . Further discussions on the relation between dual and primal spaces can be found in Appendix A of their paper ( Cheung and Piliouras ( NeurIPS 2020 ) ) . > Why does the sign of C matter ? Can you explain where this Eqn comes from ? ...... The function C was derived by Cheung and Piliouras ( COLT 2019 ) . We gave an explanation in page 5 : the sign ( of C ) determines the local volume-changing behavior around the point ( p , q ) when MWU is used . Thus , when C ( p , q ) is positive , the MWU dynamic around the point ( p , q ) is volume-expanding , while negative C ( p , q ) implies volume contraction around ( p , q ) .
