Overall the reviewers and I think that this paper presents some nice contributions to the adversarial attacks literature, demonstrating a low-sample-complexity, \"physically-realizable\" attack in a domain of clear importance and interest in machine learning.  The move to considering more \"in the loop\" adversarial examples is particularly compelling, and the threat model and improvement over BO methods are both compelling here.\n\nThe main downside of this paper, of course, is the fact that the \"physical adversarial examples\" are of course nothing of the sort: they are simulated.  Rather, they are just simulated in a manner that may plausibly be slightly more amenable to real-world deployment. The authors claim that they don't carry out an evaluation on a real system because it is \"dangerous\" is a bit overly dramatic: the tests could easily be carried out in a controlled environment, and demonstration on an actual physical system (even, e.g., and RC car) would vastly improve the impact of this work.  As it is, the paper is borderline, but ultimately slightly below the high bar set by ICLR publications.  I would strongly encourage the authors to reconsider the inclusion of the word \"physical\" in the title, as it honestly sets expectations high for a promise that the paper cannot deliver on, or (even better) to run real experiments on even a small physical system, demonstrating the transferability there.  The paper ultimately has the potential for a high impact in this field, if these issues are addressed.", "reviews": [{"review_id": "a7gkBG1m6e-0", "review_text": "To summarize , the authors propose a road-painting attack with rectangles to deceive a controller network such that the car will deviate from the correct trajectory . The simulation is done on CARLA . * * The threat model * * Painting roads with rectangles is very interesting . The closest one I saw is patching stop signs with rectangle markers [ Eykholt 2018 ] as cited in the paper . Meanwhile , this setup brings many questions . First , the attack space is incredibly small ( parameterized color rectangles on the road ) . With such a small space , I would expect the space allowed for changing the controller network output is also small . On the contrary , in traditional pixelwise adversarial attack , the attack vector is high-dimensional so the vulnerabilities can stack up to change the network output to arbitrary values . In the current setup , such stacking-up is unlikely to happen . Therefore , even the attack is successful , I believe tuning with gradient-based or gradient-free optimizers does no help much ; the baseline attack success rate could be already high . In other words , I doubt that even random rectangles may already cause deviations and infractions . Searching with BayesOpt or GradOpt may not help much ; there could be a wide range of parameters that can cause reasonable deviations already . This setup is also perceivable by humans and thus not stealth . In traditional adversarial attacks , the perturbations are small enough to be ignored by humans but will cause a deep network to fail ; the current setup is not the case ; therefore it can be easily defended by humans . * * GradOpt v.s . BO * * - BO is a black-box optimizer that has no access to the inner structure of the controller . GradOpt in this paper is a white-box model and it is unfair to compare BO with GradOpt . - GradOpt is a very standard gradient-based optimization pipeline for adversarial attacks involved with 3D projection and rendering . Judging from the images , I believe the rectangles are not shaded , so an affine transformation already suffices . This limits the novelty of the method . * * Constraints for the attack vector * * I could not find the description of the constraints for the attack vectors . If there is no constraint ; then there exists a trivial solution : just paint the road to a constant color using an infinitely large rectangle and there are no lanes anymore . It will be very interesting to see the evaluation metrics in this case just for ablation purposes . * * Transferability * * With a small attacking space , I am curious whether GradOpt learns to find the vulnerabilities in the network , or learns to cover the important regions on the road . Also it is unclear whether it will succeed for real images and videos . The submission lacks transferability experiments to study those scenarios . [ Update after reading authors ' comments ] The critical issue is resolved : it seems their method is indeed better than plain BO , which in turn is better than random parameters .

( BayesOpt ) paper and is motivated by the fact that such a pattern is more realistic to implement physically ( i.e. , paint on roads ) . Indeed , this makes optimization harder than for say a per-pixel pattern attack ( a modified version of our method could fix all the rectangles were small squares that formed a grid and estimate just colors for each square for which we could compute gradients directly : but this would perhaps not be physically realizable ) . - The random rectangles question is an interesting one , and actually the BayesOpt paper did that precise study : they demonstrated that randomly sampling parameters ( even in the low dimensional parameter space they considered ) was unable to find a successful attack . We apologize for not discussing these results in our paper and will do so in the camera ready . Moreover , note that as our results show , we are able to find successful attacks very frequently when BayesOpt can not : which implies that the optimization is non-trivial . - Vs BO : Note that while BO is a black-box method , the approach requires calling not just the controller , but also a physics engine ( or physically driving the car ) , many times . Since we evaluate our method and BO with the same number of optimization iterations , we have the same number of calls to the controller , where we also additionally have access to gradients . But note that we do not need to call the physics engine as many times . Note that the main novelty of our work is that it is the first to realize a gradient-based attack on the closed loop driving controller , by using an approximate rendering approach that is shown to successfully transfer over to the full physics-based simulator . - Stealth/Constraints : All of our patterns are constrained to lie on a small patch of road , i.e. , within our 400x400 canvas in the reference view ( appendix A ) . Therefore , while the patterns are obvious when seen , they are only visible when one is close to the intersection ( in that sense , it is similar to the sticker attack ) . We will add visualizations of the canvas area in the camera ready . - Covering the entire canvas ( not the entire road ) with a uniform color rectangle does not lead to a successful attack . This suggests that our optimizer is actually finding patterns that confuse the controller about the layout of the road . - Transferability : We are not able to evaluate these patterns on a real car ( this would be impractical and dangerous ) . But we do run transferability experiments to other visibility and weather conditions ( see Table 3 ) than what was used for optimization . This change in conditions leads to a significant change in visual appearance , as seen in Figures 4 and 5 in the appendix ."}, {"review_id": "a7gkBG1m6e-1", "review_text": "The paper proposes an end-to-end differentiable method for finding adversarial patterns to be added to the environment for autonomous driving . It utilizes image composition with homography thus it can compose the adversarial pattern into the image frames of all image frames of a driving sequence . Combined with a neural-network based controller which outputs the steering angle , the proposed method can find adversarial examples more efficiently comparing to a Bayesian optimization ( BO ) based baseline while resulting in trajectories with greater deviation . The proposed method relies on an approximation of the image frames of the trajectories by adding random noise to the controller outputs and use those trajectories for learning . This dramatically reduces the number of calls to the simulator comparing to the baseline BO method . The paper states that `` Given the fact that actual control is closed-loop , it is not evident that this simple approach would work ; however , our experiments below show that it is remarkably effective , despite its simplicity .

Those two may not necessarily correlate ( An example will be if the car is supposed to go straight , while zero steering and both a left and a following correcting right steering will keep the car straight thus resulting in very similar trajectory , the controls are more different.On the other hand , a single left or right steering will result in large trajectory error as it accumulates . ) 5.All experiment results are in simulation so it 's hard to draw conclusion regarding real driving scenarios .", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "- The main benefit of our `` trajectory data augmentation '' approach is that it allows us to train our attack to be effective when observed from a diversity of viewpoints .

But that is a constraint anyway since we allow ourselves to only modify a small stretch of road . For attacks that must be realized over a longer horizon , you are right : that would probably require a closed loop . - The noisy trajectories do indeed result in infractions . - Our choice of four trajectories was to balance the need for multiple views with the need to minimize the number of calibration simulator calls . We \u2019 ve already shown an ablation when using only one trajectory in Table 1 , and will add ablations for results with 2 and 3 trajectories to the camera ready ( essentially , effectiveness increases with more trajectories ) . - Since the possible infraction scores can change from scenario to scenario , rather than showing standard deviations , we opted for a `` sign-test '' as showing statistical significance . All our tables include the % > = metric , which shows that our approach leads to a higher infraction ( or deviation ) than BayesOpt in a large fraction of scenarios and settings . - While our evaluation is in simulation ( it would be impractical/dangerous to do this on real cars ) , we evaluate generalizability by looking at how well our attacks transfer over to different visibility and weather conditions ( Table 3 ) , where the video frames are quite different from those used for optimization ( see Figs 4 and 5 in the appendix ) .
