The main idea is to align the cross-domain representation with Sliced Wasserstein Distance ( SWD ) , and train the sentiment classifier on additional pseudo-labeled target domain data . By modeling the embedding spaces as a mixture of Gaussians ( GMM ) , with one Gaussian per sentiment class , the authors sample for pseudo-labeled data with the GMM and retain only the samples that are labeled confidently by the classifier . The authors presented a theoretical analysis leveraging on previous results for SWD for domain adaptation . Strengths : - the paper presents an appealing representation learning approach to cross-domain alignment of representations . Weaknesses : - By only retaining samples with high classifier confidence , the authors claim that `` the margin between the clusters in the source domain increase if we use the generated pseudo-dataset for domain alignment '' . This seems to be an important claim in this paper , as the authors named their approach a `` max-margin '' approach , and they argue that it is this effect that is the reason for the good performance of their model . However , there is no proof in the paper of this claim , and I am not sure if that is true in a mathematical sense . - As a general domain adaptation paper , the results would be more convincing with another data set . As an application paper for cross-domain sentiment analysis , the authors failed to compare against recent work such as [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] and [ 4 ] . Du et al .

It seems that despite finding our work appealing , you have concerns about both the algorithm and also the results . We have responded to your comments below . We think addressing your comments about the experiments is more straightforward and we hope you reconsider your rating . 1.Hopefully , we can state our reasoning more clearly here . Please refer to Figure 1 and note the visualization for embedding space on both sides of the figure . We have tried to visualize the typical data representation in the embedding space in the two panels of Figure 1 . If we can model the source distribution with a GMM quite well , as in the left-hand side of Figure 1 , and then choose high-confidence samples of GMM , we will have a situation similar to the right-hand side of Figure 1 . We meant that if we use the high-confident samples and solve Eq 6 , data representations for source and target domain would be moved towards the high confidence region and as a result , the margin between the classes will increase similar to the right-hand side of Figure 1 . This intuition has been empirically verified in Figure 2 ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( d ) which reiterate Figure 1 with real data . Judging from these subfigures , you can see that the margin between the classes has increased as a result of using our algorithm . However , we agree with your point about the term \u201c max-margin \u201d in the title . We are open to changing the title according to your suggestion because the margin is not the maximum possible margin in our method and hopefully other researchers are going to develop UDA methods that outperform our method in terms of inducing larger margins . 2.Thank you for pointing out these works . Please note that : HATN : their experimental setup is different from the common setting in the literature and hence comparing against them will not be fair . First , they are using 5000 data points for training which is significantly larger than the common value of 2000 data points in the literature . All the papers we have listed use 2000 training data points . Second , they use word2vec to embed the reviews . For these reasons , we don \u2019 t think it is fair to add HATN to our table . The good performance of HATN likely is because of using more training data , rather than success in domain adaptation . IATN : The same is true about HATN . They use even more training data points , i.e , 5600 data points for training , and also use word2vec . Using more training data is likely a partial reason why IATN outperforms HATN . In conclusion , it is not fair to compare HATN and IATN with our method and other methods in our tables . Of course , choosing the testing/training split is somewhat arbitrary and there is nothing wrong with what HATN and IATN works have done . But we followed what is more common in the literature . The same logic works for Du et al because they use BERT features which means they use an additional large dataset that has been used to train BERT . Also , we noted that the results Du et al report for IATN are exactly copied from the IATN original paper and hence the above logic is correct . Their reported results for HATN are slightly different from the original paper but it is not clear why this disparity exists in the Du et al paper . As a sanity check , we performed one experiment by using 5600 data points for training and 400 for testing , and the performance on B- > E task boosted to 86.3 which is comparable with 85.7 of IATN and 86.5 of HATN . Note that adding word2vec would likely give us a further boost . For the above reasoning , we did include the above works in our tables . 3.Thank you for pointing out the typos .

After the training on the source domain , they use a Gaussian mixture model to generalize the samples and then select a subset of the drawn samples from the learned GMM for which the confidence level of the classifier is more than a predefined threshold . Therefore the drawn samples will keep larger margin between classes in the source domain . The authors provide a theoretic analysis to justify the algorithm . The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of their method . Pros : 1.The authors enlarge the margin between classes on the source domain to reduce the possibility of missclassification on the target domain because of domain drift . 2.The paper analyzes their method in a theoretic way . Cons : 1.The proposed method is very straightforward . The 'max-margin ' component in the paper is implemented by the selection of samples with higher confidence of the classifier . Therefore , the performance depends on careful tuning of the threshold . A higher threshold will result in lots of samples in the source domain will be filtered out and then there is information loss during the alignment between source domain and target domain . 2.The evaluation is weak . Some experimental settings are unreasonable . a ) The baseline methods use different dimensions of feature vectors . Some use 5000 and the other use 30000 as the vector size .

We think that your concerns about experimental weaknesses can be addressed . We have responded to your comments below . We hope you reconsider your judgment . 1.Please note that when we discard a group of samples , the source samples are not discarded . The threshold only is used to pick the GMM samples . All the source and the training data points would still be used . As demonstrated in Eq.6 , none of the source samples are discarded . However , you have a fair point that we need further experiments to study the effect of the value of Tau . We tried to study this effect more accurately following your comment . Please refer to our answer to your next question . In short , it seems that we really don \u2019 t need to tune tau very carefully . As the theorem suggests , verified by the new experiment , a value that is reasonably close to 1 would work . 2. a ) Please note that we did not mean to compare methods that use 5000 dimension vectors with the methods 30000 at all . As you pointed out , doing so is unreasonable . We regret not to mention this more explicitly in the paper . We clarified this point in the paper and changed the table to avoid this impression . What we meant was to compare the methods that use the same dimension against each other . We explored the literature for comparison and since TAT had reported results with 30000 features , we wanted to be complete in our Table . Unfortunately , the rest of the methods do not report their performance for the 30000 dimension so we could n't include them . b ) As pointed out by our theorem , the threshold should be close to 1 to make the upperbound in Eq 7 to be tight . So , we previously set it to be 0.95 following this intuition but we agree it was an arbitrary choice which could be done systematically according to your suggestion . c ) Thank you for your suggestion . In response to your comment , we performed a new experiment and updated the paper using a curve . Please check the paper for the updated experiment . We hope adding this graph addresses your concern and convinces you that turning tau is not a bottleneck for our algorithm . 3.Thank you for pointing out the typos . We corrected them in the paper .

The key idea is to train a domain-agnostic embedding space based on learning a prototypical source distribution with GMM , which is then used to align domain distributions via SWD minimization . Experimental results on Amazon multi-domain review dataset empirically demonstrate that the proposed SAUM method can outperform the state-of-the-art domain adaptation baselines . Moreover , detailed theoretical and empirical analysis are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method . Strengths 1.The paper is reasonably well-written and structured . 2.The proposed SAUM method is technically sound . 3.The proposed SAUM method can outperform state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods . 4.Theoretical analysis and empirical analysis and sufficient and convinced . Weaknesses 1.For domain adaptation in the NLP field , powerful pre-trained language models , e.g. , BERT , XLNet , can overcome the domain-shift problem to some extent . Thus , the authors should be used as the base encoder for all methods and then compare the efficacy of the transfer parts instead of the simplest n-gram features . 2.The whole procedure is slightly complex . The author formulates the prototypical distribution as a GMM , which has high algorithm complexity . However , formal complexity analysis is absent . The author should provide an analysis of the time complexity and training time of the proposed SAUM method compared with other baselines . Besides , a statistically significant test is absent for performance improvements . 3.The motivation of learning a large margin between different classes is exactly discriminative learning , which is not novel when combined with domain adaptation methods and already proposed in the existing literature , e.g. , Unified Deep Supervised Domain Adaptation and Generalization , Saeid et al. , ICCV 2017 . Contrastive Adaptation Network for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation , Kang et al. , CVPR 2019 Joint Domain Alignment and Discriminative Feature Learning for Unsupervised Deep Domain Adaptation , Chen et al. , AAAI 2019 . However , this paper lacks detailed discussions and comparisons with existing discriminative feature learning methods for domain adaptation . 4.The unlabeled data ( 2000 ) from the preprocessed Amazon review dataset ( Blitzer version ) is perfectly balanced , which is impractical in real-world applications . Since we can not control the label distribution of unlabeled data during training , the author should also use a more convinced setting as did in Adaptive Semi-supervised Learning for Cross-domain Sentiment Classification , He et al. , EMNLP 2018 , which directly samples unlabeled data from millions of reviews . 5.The paper lacks some related work about cross-domain sentiment analysis , e.g. , End-to-end adversarial memory network for cross-domain sentiment classification , Li et al. , IJCAI 2017 Adaptive Semi-supervised Learning for Cross-domain Sentiment Classification , He et al. , EMNLP 2018 Hierarchical attention transfer network for cross-domain sentiment classification , Li et al. , AAAI 18 Questions : 1.Have the authors conducted the significance tests for the improvements ? 2.How fast does this algorithm run or train compared with other baselines ?", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Thank you for your feedback . We are pleased that the reviewer recognizes the theoretical contribution of our work and has found the experiments to be convincing for the common setting in the literature . It seems to the authors that you have a positive assessment of the core idea of the paper and your concerns are more about some lacking aspects that we have tried address . We have responded to the points you raised about the weaknesses below . We hope you reconsider your initial review . 1.We agree with your statement that using pre-trained models such as BERT can mitigate domain-shift considerably . But please note that in the common domain adaptation scenario that we explore in this work , we are interested in transferring knowledge from a single \u201c source domain \u201d to a \u201c target domain \u201d . Models similar to BERT or XLNet need a very large corpus for pretraining . This means that we are relying on an additional huge \u201c source domain \u201d that is used to train these models . Hence , performing experiments with these models goes against the goal of domain adaptation . We agree however that these models address the challenge of domain-shift in many applications but please note that even for a method as good as BERT , domain-shift can be problematic if we test the model on domains that are very different from the training corpora . To sum up , we think using BERT or XLNet features are not fair for domain adaptation unless we test on a domain where domain-shift is a real challenge . 2.Learning a GMM typically has a high algorithmic complexity because iterative algorithms like EM must be used . But this is not the case for our problem . The major reason is that we learn GMM for a labeled dataset . For this reason , not only it is a much simpler task but providing exact complexity analysis is possible . We have updated the paper and added complexity analysis . Please refer to the paper Appendix to see our analysis . In short , we think that the complexity of learning GMM actually is not high compared to other computations , e.g. , backpropagation . 3.Unfortunately , it is not easy to address a comment about novelty . We acknowledge the right of the reviewer to measure the subjective notion of \u201c novelty \u201d but we respectfully ask the reviewer to compare all of these four papers once more side-by-side and check whether our method is similar to these methods ? We agree that all four methods try to make the embedding space discriminative . However , these works develop dramatically different algorithms to make the embedding space discriminative . Please note that two of these papers are published in 2019 after the 2017 paper . The 2019 papers have been assessed to be novel both by the reviewers and also the community , evident from their citation level . These works were not discarded because the idea of \u201c making the embedding space discriminative \u201d had been used in 2017 . Similarly , we think that our novelty is to propose a completely new approach to learn a discriminative embedding space , despite the fact that prior works have benefited from this strategy . Finally , none of the above methods address an NLP problem and our work might claim novelty in that it focuses on the less explored area of domain adaptation for NLP . 4.This is a fair concern and we agree with your statement . It is also a great suggestion for exploration in the area of domain adaptation . To address this comment , we performed an additional experiment by generating controlled imbalanced datasets from the Amazon dataset . Please check the updated Appendix . In short , it seems that at least for the controlled experiments that we performed , label imbalance has not lead to significant performance degradation . 5.We referenced these works in our introduction . Questions : 1 . We did not fully understand \u201c the significance test \u201d that you meant . Ablative studies are used to verify a similar notion in ML community in that they are used to verify whether the algorithm steps are indeed statistically effective . If you specify more what test you have in your mind , we hopefully can perform and update the draft further in the remaining time . 2.We measured the running time for our algorithm on our GPU cluster which is equipped with four GeForce RTX 2080 GPUs . Running the full pipeline takes 18 minutes on average . Existing works in the literature have not reported their running time so comparison against them is not straightforward , particularly due to the effect of hardware . Also , please note that since training is performed once in domain adaptation , as opposed to areas like online learning , training time is not a metric of interest in domain adaptation literature and to the best of our knowledge , no prior UDA algorithm has reported this metric ."}], "0": {"review_id": "fm58XfadSTF-0", "review_text": "Pros : The proposed SAUM2 is novel .

As the theorem suggests , verified by the new experiment , a value that is reasonably close to 1 would work . 2. a ) Please note that we did not mean to compare methods that use 5000 dimension vectors with the methods 30000 at all . As you pointed out , doing so is unreasonable . We regret not to mention this more explicitly in the paper . We clarified this point in the paper and changed the table to avoid this impression . What we meant was to compare the methods that use the same dimension against each other . We explored the literature for comparison and since TAT had reported results with 30000 features , we wanted to be complete in our Table . Unfortunately , the rest of the methods do not report their performance for the 30000 dimension so we could n't include them . b ) As pointed out by our theorem , the threshold should be close to 1 to make the upperbound in Eq 7 to be tight . So , we previously set it to be 0.95 following this intuition but we agree it was an arbitrary choice which could be done systematically according to your suggestion . c ) Thank you for your suggestion . In response to your comment , we performed a new experiment and updated the paper using a curve . Please check the paper for the updated experiment . We hope adding this graph addresses your concern and convinces you that turning tau is not a bottleneck for our algorithm . 3.Thank you for pointing out the typos . We corrected them in the paper . We will make sure to have the paper proofread by a professional editor in our organization for the camera-ready version ."}, "3": {"review_id": "fm58XfadSTF-3", "review_text": "This paper proposes a new domain adaptation SAUM method that learns a large margin classifier between different classes for cross-domain sentiment analysis . The key idea is to train a domain-agnostic embedding space based on learning a prototypical source distribution with GMM , which is then used to align domain distributions via SWD minimization . Experimental results on Amazon multi-domain review dataset empirically demonstrate that the proposed SAUM method can outperform the state-of-the-art domain adaptation baselines . Moreover , detailed theoretical and empirical analysis are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method . Strengths 1.The paper is reasonably well-written and structured . 2.The proposed SAUM method is technically sound . 3.The proposed SAUM method can outperform state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods . 4.Theoretical analysis and empirical analysis and sufficient and convinced . Weaknesses 1.For domain adaptation in the NLP field , powerful pre-trained language models , e.g. , BERT , XLNet , can overcome the domain-shift problem to some extent . Thus , the authors should be used as the base encoder for all methods and then compare the efficacy of the transfer parts instead of the simplest n-gram features . 2.The whole procedure is slightly complex . The author formulates the prototypical distribution as a GMM , which has high algorithm complexity . However , formal complexity analysis is absent . The author should provide an analysis of the time complexity and training time of the proposed SAUM method compared with other baselines . Besides , a statistically significant test is absent for performance improvements . 3.The motivation of learning a large margin between different classes is exactly discriminative learning , which is not novel when combined with domain adaptation methods and already proposed in the existing literature , e.g. , Unified Deep Supervised Domain Adaptation and Generalization , Saeid et al. , ICCV 2017 . Contrastive Adaptation Network for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation , Kang et al. , CVPR 2019 Joint Domain Alignment and Discriminative Feature Learning for Unsupervised Deep Domain Adaptation , Chen et al. , AAAI 2019 . However , this paper lacks detailed discussions and comparisons with existing discriminative feature learning methods for domain adaptation . 4.The unlabeled data ( 2000 ) from the preprocessed Amazon review dataset ( Blitzer version ) is perfectly balanced , which is impractical in real-world applications . Since we can not control the label distribution of unlabeled data during training , the author should also use a more convinced setting as did in Adaptive Semi-supervised Learning for Cross-domain Sentiment Classification , He et al. , EMNLP 2018 , which directly samples unlabeled data from millions of reviews . 5.The paper lacks some related work about cross-domain sentiment analysis , e.g. , End-to-end adversarial memory network for cross-domain sentiment classification , Li et al. , IJCAI 2017 Adaptive Semi-supervised Learning for Cross-domain Sentiment Classification , He et al. , EMNLP 2018 Hierarchical attention transfer network for cross-domain sentiment classification , Li et al. , AAAI 18 Questions : 1.Have the authors conducted the significance tests for the improvements ? 2.How fast does this algorithm run or train compared with other baselines ?", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Thank you for your feedback . We are pleased that the reviewer recognizes the theoretical contribution of our work and has found the experiments to be convincing for the common setting in the literature . It seems to the authors that you have a positive assessment of the core idea of the paper and your concerns are more about some lacking aspects that we have tried address . We have responded to the points you raised about the weaknesses below . We hope you reconsider your initial review . 1.We agree with your statement that using pre-trained models such as BERT can mitigate domain-shift considerably . But please note that in the common domain adaptation scenario that we explore in this work , we are interested in transferring knowledge from a single \u201c source domain \u201d to a \u201c target domain \u201d . Models similar to BERT or XLNet need a very large corpus for pretraining . This means that we are relying on an additional huge \u201c source domain \u201d that is used to train these models . Hence , performing experiments with these models goes against the goal of domain adaptation . We agree however that these models address the challenge of domain-shift in many applications but please note that even for a method as good as BERT , domain-shift can be problematic if we test the model on domains that are very different from the training corpora . To sum up , we think using BERT or XLNet features are not fair for domain adaptation unless we test on a domain where domain-shift is a real challenge . 2.Learning a GMM typically has a high algorithmic complexity because iterative algorithms like EM must be used . But this is not the case for our problem . The major reason is that we learn GMM for a labeled dataset . For this reason , not only it is a much simpler task but providing exact complexity analysis is possible . We have updated the paper and added complexity analysis . Please refer to the paper Appendix to see our analysis . In short , we think that the complexity of learning GMM actually is not high compared to other computations , e.g. , backpropagation . 3.Unfortunately , it is not easy to address a comment about novelty . We acknowledge the right of the reviewer to measure the subjective notion of \u201c novelty \u201d but we respectfully ask the reviewer to compare all of these four papers once more side-by-side and check whether our method is similar to these methods ? We agree that all four methods try to make the embedding space discriminative . However , these works develop dramatically different algorithms to make the embedding space discriminative . Please note that two of these papers are published in 2019 after the 2017 paper . The 2019 papers have been assessed to be novel both by the reviewers and also the community , evident from their citation level . These works were not discarded because the idea of \u201c making the embedding space discriminative \u201d had been used in 2017 . Similarly , we think that our novelty is to propose a completely new approach to learn a discriminative embedding space , despite the fact that prior works have benefited from this strategy . Finally , none of the above methods address an NLP problem and our work might claim novelty in that it focuses on the less explored area of domain adaptation for NLP . 4.This is a fair concern and we agree with your statement . It is also a great suggestion for exploration in the area of domain adaptation . To address this comment , we performed an additional experiment by generating controlled imbalanced datasets from the Amazon dataset . Please check the updated Appendix . In short , it seems that at least for the controlled experiments that we performed , label imbalance has not lead to significant performance degradation . 5.We referenced these works in our introduction . Questions : 1 . We did not fully understand \u201c the significance test \u201d that you meant . Ablative studies are used to verify a similar notion in ML community in that they are used to verify whether the algorithm steps are indeed statistically effective . If you specify more what test you have in your mind , we hopefully can perform and update the draft further in the remaining time . 2.We measured the running time for our algorithm on our GPU cluster which is equipped with four GeForce RTX 2080 GPUs . Running the full pipeline takes 18 minutes on average . Existing works in the literature have not reported their running time so comparison against them is not straightforward , particularly due to the effect of hardware . Also , please note that since training is performed once in domain adaptation , as opposed to areas like online learning , training time is not a metric of interest in domain adaptation literature and to the best of our knowledge , no prior UDA algorithm has reported this metric ."}}
