They argue that real-world noise should be class-relevant. Pros: 1. The authors find a new angle to exploit robust learning with noisy labels. 2. The authors perform numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposal. And their experimental result support their previous claims. Cons: We have two questions in the following. 1. Basic definition: in learning with noisy labels, there are two basic models. First, most research focuses on class-conditional noise (CCN) model [1]. Second, recent research explore a bit on instance-dependent noise (IDN) model [2, 3]. As far as I know, there is no class-irrelevant label noise and class-relevevant label noise. In CCN mode, people would like to use symmetric noise and asymmetric noise as a basic benchmark to conduct experiments. 2. Motivation: The authors want to claim CNNs are more robust to such realistic label noise than class-irrelevant label noise. However, they make one mistake. They do not have a clear definition about realistic label noise. In my mind, I believe Clothing1M [4] should be realistic label noise dataset. By the way, in learning with noisy labels, there are two kinds of research. First, people propose new robust methods for CCN model. Second, people propose new robust methods for IDN models. Proposing new setting should be encouraged. However, the setting and conclusion should be reasonable. References: [1] D. Angluin and P. Laird. Learning from noisy examples. Machine Learning, 1988.
