Generally, the last bit is the most novel, interesting and promising one, however, I agree with the reviewers that empirical evaluation of this technique does not seem sufficient. \n \n Positive:\n -- the ideas are sensible \n -- the paper is reasonably well written and clear\n \n Negative\n -- most ideas are not so novel\n -- the word embedding method requires extra analysis / evaluation, comparison to other methods for producing context-sensitive embeddings, etc", "reviews": [{"review_id": "r1Chut9xl-0", "review_text": "The paper claims improved inference for density estimation of sparse data (here text documents) using deep generative Gaussian models (variational auto-encoders), and a method for deriving word embeddings from the model's generative parameters that allows for a degree of interpretability similar to that of Bayesian generative topic models. To discuss the contributions I will quickly review the generative story in the paper: first a K-dimensional latent representation is sampled from a multivariate Gaussian, then an MLP (with parameters \\theta) predicts unnormalised potentials over a vocabulary of V words, the potentials are exponentiated and normalised to make the parameters of a multinomial from where word observations are repeatedly sampled to make a document. Here intractable inference is replaced by the VAE formulation where an inference network (with parameters \\phi) independently predicts for each document the mean and variance of a normal distribution (amenable to reparameterised gradient computation). The first, and rather trivial, contribution is to use tf-idf features to inject first order statistics (a global information) into local observations. The authors claim that this is particularly helpful in the case of sparse data such as text. The second contribution is more interesting. In optimising generative parameters (\\theta) and variational parameters (\\phi), the authors turn to a treatment which is reminiscent of the original SVI procedure. That is, they see the variational parameters \\phi as *global* variational parameters, and the predicted mean \\mu(x) and covariance \\Sigma(x) of each observation x are treated as *local* variational parameters. In the original VAE, local parameters are not directly optimised, instead they are indirectly optimised via optimisation of the global parameters utilised in their prediction (shared MLP parameters). Here, local parameters are optimised holding generative parameters fixed (line 3 of Algorithm 1). The optimised local parameters are then used in the gradient step of the generative parameters (line 4 of Algorithm 1). Finally, global variational parameters are also updated (line 5). Whereas indeed other authors have proposed to optimise local parameters, I think that deriving this procedure from the more familiar SVI makes the contribution less of a trick and easier to relate to. Some things aren't entirely clear to me. I think it would have been nice if the authors had shown the functional form of the gradient used in step 3 of Algorithm 1. The gradient step for global variational parameters (line 5 of Algorithm 1) uses the very first prediction of local parameters (thus ignoring the optimisation in step 3), this is unclear to me. Perhaps I am missing a fundamental reason why that has to be the case (either way, please clarify). The authors argue that this optimisation turns out helpful to modelling sparse data because there is evidence that the generative model p_\\theta(x|z) suffers from poor initialisation. Please, discuss why you expect the initialisation problem to be worse in the case of sparse data. The final contribution is a neat procedure to derive word embeddings from the generative model parameters. These embeddings are then used to interpret what the model has learnt. Interestingly, these word embeddings are context-sensitive once that the latent variable models an entire document. About Figures 2a and 2b: the caption says that solid lines indicate validation perplexity for M=1 (no optimisation of local parameters) and dashed lines indicate M=100 (100 iterations of optimisation of local parameters), but the legends of the figures suggest a different reading. If I interpret the figures based on the caption, then it seems that indeed deeper networks exposed to more data benefit from optimisation of local parameters. Are the authors pretty sure that in Figure 2b models with M=1 have reached a plateau (so that longer training would not allow them to catch up with M=100 curves)? As the authors explain in the caption, x-axis is not comparable on running time, thus the question. The analysis of singular values seems like an interesting way to investigate how the model is using its capacity. However, I can barely interpret Figures 2c and 2d, I think the authors could have walked readers through them. As for the word embedding I am missing an evaluation on a predictive task. Also, while illustrative, Table 2b is barely reproducible. The text reads \"we create a document comprising a subset of words in the the context\u2019s Wikipedia page.\" which is rather vague. I wonder whether this construct needs to be carefully designed in order to get Table 2b. In sum, I have a feeling that the inference technique and the embedding technique are both useful, but perhaps they should have been presented separately so that each could have been explored in greater depth.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Thank you for your review and your detailed comments ! \u201c ( line 5 of Algorithm 1 ) uses the very first prediction of local parameters ( thus ignoring the optimisation in step 3 ) , this is unclear to me. \u201d We apologize for the misunderstanding .
