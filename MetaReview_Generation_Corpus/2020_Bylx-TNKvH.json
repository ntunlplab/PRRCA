Reviewers found the paper easy to read and the proof technically sound. There was some debate over the motivation for the paper, Reviewer 1 argues that there is no practical significance for the result, a point that the authors do not deny. I appreciate the concerns raised by Reviewer 1, theorists in machine learning should think carefully about the motivation for their work. However, while there is no clear practical significance of this work, I believe there is value to accepting it. Because the considered question concerns a sufficiently fundamental property of neural networks, and the proof is both easy to read and provides insights into a well studied class of models, I believe many researchers will find value in reading this paper.", "reviews": [{"review_id": "Bylx-TNKvH-0", "review_text": " In this paper, the authors studied the equivalence class of ReLU networks with non-increasing weights, and proved that permutation and scaling are the only function preserving weight transformations. The proof technique is novel, and provides some insights in the geometry space of the loss surface. I think the proof technique could have its general implications to some other research, however, the direct value of this paper is not very clear. 1) The paper starts with the discussions on the redundancy introduced by over-parametrization, as one of its motivations. However, what is discussed in this paper is actually far distant from over-parametrization. The redundancy in over-parametrized networks and the redundancy in ReLU networks are different concepts and the connection between them is not well established. The over-parametrization is talking about the smooth information flow brought by wide intermediate layers, however, the equivalence class in this paper is more about the mathematical properties of the activation functions and the topological connections of the neural networks. I feel that the authors have some confusing understanding on these two concepts. 2) The theory was established regarding restrictive types of ReLU networks (feedforward, with non-increasing width). However, many widely used networks are not of this kind. Without extensions to other shapes of the networks, convolutional and recurrent structures, and many kind of normalization transformations (e.g., batch norm and layer norm), the practical value of this paper is limited. 3) Some important references are missing. The following paper has in-depth theoretical analysis on ReLU networks, and characterizes the redundancy brought by positive-scale invariant properties of ReLU networks. It is strange that the authors did not cite it. It would be necessary for the authors to discuss their additional technical contributions given this ICLR 2019 paper. - Q. Meng, et al.

Different people may have different criteria on evaluating a paper and my criterion is not only about \"what\", but more importantly about \"so what\". I still think the authors should think harder about the implications of their work, either theoretically or practically. Furthermore, I understand that some published papers also use restricted settings to ease their proofs, however, I personally do not think this is well justified. I think for top conference like ICLR, more solid and less restrictive works are preferred.
