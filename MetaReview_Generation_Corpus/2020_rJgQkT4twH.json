The supervised learning task is zebrafish bout classification which is relevant for biological experiments. The paper analyzed the image support for the learned neural net features using a previously developed technique called Deep Taylor Decomposition. This analysis showed that the CNNs when applied to the raw video were relying on artifacts of the data collection process, which spuriously increased classification accuracies by a \"clever Hans\" mechanism. By identifying and removing these artifacts, a retrained CNN classifier was able to outperform an older SVM classifier. More importantly, the analysis of the network features enabled the researchers to isolate which parts of the zebrafish motion were relevant for the classification.\n\nThe reviewers found the paper to be well-written and the experiments to be well-designed. The reviewers suggested a some changes to the phrasing in the document, which the authors adopted. In response to the reviewers, the authors also clarified their use of ImageNet for pre-training and examined alternative approaches for building saliency maps.\n\nThis paper should be published as the reviewers found the paper to be a good case study of how model interpretability can be useful in practice.

The hype over deep learning has caused certain disdain among a section of the research community over the workings of deep neural networks. This is evident in this paper with the authors calling CNNs \"black box\" and the learnings of a neural network \"cheating\". Perhaps the authors are not aware that CNNs are hardly black boxes, their inner workings quite transparent in mathematical terms, which the submitted paper itself explores. Perhaps the authors are also not aware that the fallacies that causes CNNs to overfit on some characteristics in the input data are also present in other machine learning tools such as SVMs. Perhaps the intention of the authors is to bring more relevance to the dangers of spurious correlations, especially when the applications are critical. I hope the community can work together in improving the state of the art while improving transparency and explainability. BACKGROUND: Hypothesis: Prey movements in zebrafish are characterized by specific motions, that are triggered by a specific pathway involving an area called AF7. Validation: Semmelhack et. al. (2014) removed the AF7 neuropil and observed that they failed to respond to prey stimuli AI: the prey stimuli was a characteristic movement that an SVM was trained to detect. Good to know that the authors will share their code. It is not explained why the authors chose to pretrain on ImageNet, since ImageNet does not have any image classes that are comparable to the dataset the authors use. They then proceed to do a hyperparameter sweep to fine-tune on their dataset. It is also not explained why they chose to average outputs of 500 output nodes to get two outputs, instead of simply replacing the last layer with a 2-neuron layer and finetune, as is general practice. The level of detail in the training procedure is very helpful to reproduce the setting as well as establish a reference for any future work in this direction. This itself is a notable achievement and a good use of significant research time. Furthermore, the authors conduct one good analysis (DTD) to explain the results of their CNN. The conclusion has many repeated points from previous sections, but it is a good summary. Given their premise about explainability in machine learning, perhaps more significance was to be given to DTD, and other methods also performed to check if the results coincide with those from DTD.", "rating": "6: Weak Accept", "reply_text": "Thank you for your detailed review and for pointing out issues that need further clarification .
