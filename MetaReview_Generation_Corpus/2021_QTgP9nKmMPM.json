It seems like there are some computational and memory benefits via parallelization . But is the additional complexity of parallel training worth it ? As the authors mention , there can be non-trivial communication costs between GPUs in addition to the additional code complexity . c ) Absent theoretical convergence guarantees , the proposed approach is a heuristic as it relies on an auxiliary function that \u2019 s somewhat arbitrary .

We address your questions and the main concerns in the following : 1 ) novelty and impact : Our proposed DGL-GNN method can improve the training efficiency of GNNs without significantly compromising model performances . By using the greedy layerwise training strategy , we would be able to enable parallelization of GNNs , which would be extremely helpful under time or per-GPU memory constraints . The layer-wise training is not a new research topic , but recently it starts to re-obtain attention from the machine learning community . The work of [ 1 ] explored its application in the large-scale image classifications task and found the layerwise training enjoys the benefit of easier theoretical analysis ( e.g.convergence analysis ) , better inner organization , and better scalability for applications under memory constraints . The work of [ 2 ] explored its application in the graph domain , and found that except for the aforementioned benefits , the layerwise training can also help us to save more training time when combining with GNNs . In our work , we aim at designing algorithms to parallelize layer-wise training on GNNs to further enhance its efficiency , which is extremely critical for deeper GNNs . Our parallelization belongs to the model-parallelization scheme , where the resources ( e.g. , GPUs ) are distributed according to the model components ( i.e. , layers in our case ) . Even if there might be some extra communication costs between GPUs , the overall time cost would be greatly reduced , and the memory burden would be distributed among multiple GPUs so the per-GPU memory cost is much smaller than the conventional joint training . The greedy objective is not an arbitrary one . In our experiment , we append the same classifier as the downstream task after each GNN layer , i.e. , the auxiliary greedy learning objective is a node classification objective ( with the same training , validation , test set as the downstream node classification task ) . With this simple but effective greedy objective , we encourage each layer to learn informative embeddings that can distinguish nodes from different classes . Exploring other or additional auxiliary functions ( e.g. , via self-supervised tasks ) would be interesting , but that is orthogonal to our work . 2 ) experiments : We have tried to combine the proposed decoupled greedy learning method with the GIN model [ 3 ] on the node classification tasks on Cora and Pubmed . We set the number of layers to be 5 , and set all the other hyper-parameters the same as in our previous experiments .

As for our previous experiment setup , there is a multi-GPU setup , in our experiments , we assign each layer to one GPU . When the number of GPUs is limited and the number of layers is large , it \u2019 s also ok to decouple the GNN into blocks ( instead of layers ) , and assign each block to one GPU , the training process would be similar . In terms of convergence , the performance won \u2019 t be improved with more epochs . References : [ 1 ] Eugene Belilovsky , Michael Eickenberg , and Edouard Oyallon .

When it first came out for Deep NNs , everyone was excited about it but nowadays hardly anyone does it . So if this method has to make a comeback for GNNs then the benefits have to be very compelling . b ) Wrt benefits , the presentation around why this idea is compelling needs to be concretely laid out . It seems like there are some computational and memory benefits via parallelization . But is the additional complexity of parallel training worth it ? As the authors mention , there can be non-trivial communication costs between GPUs in addition to the additional code complexity . c ) Absent theoretical convergence guarantees , the proposed approach is a heuristic as it relies on an auxiliary function that \u2019 s somewhat arbitrary . Further discussion is needed on why the chosen auxiliary function is a good idea . Some ablation studies with different auxiliary functions are needed to shed light on this particular choice of auxiliary function . * Experiments can be strengthened * a ) The results seem to trade off accuracy with speed and saved memory and results are reported on 3 small and one large dataset . To truly claim that this method generalizes , the authors would need to strengthen their results across some different tasks ( not just semi-supervised classification ) and models ( not just GCN ) . b ) More details are needed regarding the experimental setup .

We address your questions and the main concerns in the following : 1 ) novelty and impact : Our proposed DGL-GNN method can improve the training efficiency of GNNs without significantly compromising model performances . By using the greedy layerwise training strategy , we would be able to enable parallelization of GNNs , which would be extremely helpful under time or per-GPU memory constraints . The layer-wise training is not a new research topic , but recently it starts to re-obtain attention from the machine learning community . The work of [ 1 ] explored its application in the large-scale image classifications task and found the layerwise training enjoys the benefit of easier theoretical analysis ( e.g.convergence analysis ) , better inner organization , and better scalability for applications under memory constraints . The work of [ 2 ] explored its application in the graph domain , and found that except for the aforementioned benefits , the layerwise training can also help us to save more training time when combining with GNNs . In our work , we aim at designing algorithms to parallelize layer-wise training on GNNs to further enhance its efficiency , which is extremely critical for deeper GNNs . Our parallelization belongs to the model-parallelization scheme , where the resources ( e.g. , GPUs ) are distributed according to the model components ( i.e. , layers in our case ) . Even if there might be some extra communication costs between GPUs , the overall time cost would be greatly reduced , and the memory burden would be distributed among multiple GPUs so the per-GPU memory cost is much smaller than the conventional joint training . The greedy objective is not an arbitrary one . In our experiment , we append the same classifier as the downstream task after each GNN layer , i.e. , the auxiliary greedy learning objective is a node classification objective ( with the same training , validation , test set as the downstream node classification task ) . With this simple but effective greedy objective , we encourage each layer to learn informative embeddings that can distinguish nodes from different classes . Exploring other or additional auxiliary functions ( e.g. , via self-supervised tasks ) would be interesting , but that is orthogonal to our work . 2 ) experiments : We have tried to combine the proposed decoupled greedy learning method with the GIN model [ 3 ] on the node classification tasks on Cora and Pubmed . We set the number of layers to be 5 , and set all the other hyper-parameters the same as in our previous experiments . We show our results in the following : Dataset | Cora | Pubmed | Metric | acc | time | acc | time | GIN | 75.70 \u00b1 1.10 | 6.17 \u00b1 0.38 | 73.49 \u00b1 1.45 | 6.75 \u00b1 0.31 | DGL-GIN | 77.02 \u00b1 1.60 | 2.37 \u00b1 0.04 | 74.26 \u00b1 1.51 | 1.79 \u00b1 0.01 | According to these results , we can find that , when combining with GIN , our proposed DGL method can achieve even better performance while only needing a significantly smaller time cost . ( As for memory cost , since GIN only has one more parameter than GCN , their memory cost should be the same , so we can have the same conclusion that the per-GPU memory cost can be reduced . ) We have also tried to test our proposed method with GCN model and graph classification tasks on the MUTAG , PROTEINS , NCI1 dataset . We set the number of layers to be 3 , and use a mean aggregator in the end to obtain global representation for each graph . We run the experiments 10 times and record the mean . According to our preliminary results , GCN obtained accuracy 77.37 % , 72.32 % , 70.01 % on MUTAG , PROTEINS , NCI1 respectively , DGL-GCN obtained accuracy of 76.42 % , 71.51 % , and 67.63 % respectively , while DGL-GCN only needs around half of the time and memory cost required by GCN . As for our previous experiment setup , there is a multi-GPU setup , in our experiments , we assign each layer to one GPU . When the number of GPUs is limited and the number of layers is large , it \u2019 s also ok to decouple the GNN into blocks ( instead of layers ) , and assign each block to one GPU , the training process would be similar . In terms of convergence , the performance won \u2019 t be improved with more epochs . References : [ 1 ] Eugene Belilovsky , Michael Eickenberg , and Edouard Oyallon .
