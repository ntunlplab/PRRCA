The authors are not able to include additional experiments (such as these based on different transformations) into their revision to better convince the reviewers. In addition, the AC feels that the technical novelty of the paper is rather minor (some incremental change to VAE). In particular, related to some concerns of Reviewer 3, the AC feels the proposed idea is not too much different than introducing certain kind of side-information for supervision; the main novelty seems to be distorting the data itself somehow to provide these side information (which does not seems to be that novel).\n", "reviews": [{"review_id": "H1l-SjA5t7-0", "review_text": "This work proposes an approach for explicitly placing information in a subset of the latent variables. The approach is to construct an auxiliary generative model that takes as input the set of latent variables subtracted from the target subset, which is used to model modified data samples that do not contain the desired information. Experiments focus on learning global information. The auxiliary model is then given data that have their global information destroyed via random shuffling of image patches. # Approach seems limited. - This approach seems very limited, as there must exist a known transformation that removes the desired information. Apart from global vs. local, can the authors provide more examples of what sort of information this approach can disentangle? (Even for global vs. local, is there a transformation that can remove local information as opposed to global information?) - Can this approach learn multiple factors as opposed to just two? - What if the desired factors are not clearly disjoint and collectively exhaustive? (e.g. mustache vs. gender on human faces.) # More ablations or experiments with comparable settings would be desirable. - What is the choice of beta in the beta-VAE training objective? Apart from 1.2, this isn't mentioned. My concern here is that beta might be affecting the result more than the proposed training algorithm. Can the proposed approach perform just as well without a modified objective? Ablation studies that show the proposed algorithm can improve upon the baseline in all settings would make this a stronger paper. (e.g. this approach with normal VAE objective, and normal VAE objective without auxiliary task for the clustering experiment.) - Why were 30 discrete categories used in the clustering experiment? Is this still comparable to the approaches that use 10, which would correspond to the number of classes? # Related work. There are some well-cited works that the authors may have missed. These are ultimately different approaches, but perhaps the authors can obtain some inspiration from these: - Tranforming autoencoders [1] also apply a transformation to the image, but the goal is to learn the factor corresponding to the transformation, rather than the complement as in this work. - An opposing approach for explicit information placement with a modified training procedure (where the target information is directly placed in the target subset and can handle multiple factors) is DC-IGN [2]. I believe the DC-IGN approach is more general and can handle a superset of the tasks of this approach, without requiring an auxiliary decoder. Comparing to this approach, I wonder if it would be better to provide samples that exhibit a particular factor, or samples that conceal the factor?

The generative process is then modeled by having two latent variables -- the first responsible for generating the transformed image whereas both latent variables are responsible for generating the original input image. This inductive bias naturally enforces that the second latent variable will not model the information which the first needs to reconstruct the transformed image, due to the VAE objective penalizing redundancy in information present in the latents.

It is not obvious that shuffling image patches at a particular scale would lead to complete loss of global information, but the paper does show results on SVHN and CIFAR10 for which global information is sufficiently disentangled.
