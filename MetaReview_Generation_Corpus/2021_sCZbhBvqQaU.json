The learning of an \u201c optimal \u201d adversary for a fixed policy is based on the theory of SA-MDP in prior work . The learning of an optimal policy under a fixed adversary is done by solving a POMDP problem . Experimental results show that the proposed alternating training with learned adversaries ( ATLA ) framework can improve the performance and robustness of PPO . Strengths : 1 . The paper is well-organized and easy to follow . 2.The authors distinguish between the vulnerability of function approximations and the intrinsic weakness of policy , which is interesting and can be useful for the community to investigate the vulnerability of deep RL . 3.The experiment results show that both the learned adversary and the trained agent perform well , in terms of attacking and learning respectively . In addition , the proposed LSTM-based policy is shown to be more robust than regular feedforward NNs . Weakness : 1 . The novelty of this paper is a little limited . ( 1 ) The idea of alternative training the agent and the adversary is similar to RARL [ 1 ] , and Algorithm 2 ( ATLA ) is similar to Algorithm 1 in [ 1 ] . Although RARL focuses on the case where adversary directly changes the environment and ATLA focuses on the observation perturbation attacks , the whole ideas are still similar . ( 2 ) The main method of learning an adversary is based on the theoretical work of SA-MDP [ 2 ] . 2.The authors claim that the proposed adversary is strong since it follows the theoretical framework of SA-MDP . However , in Lemma 1 , the adversary reward in SA-MDP , \\hat { R } , is defined as the weighted average of -R , while in Algorithm 1 , the adversary reward is given by -R itself . It is not clear why such a relaxation still follows the theoretical framework . More details illustrating the approximation and some analysis about the optimality will be appreciated . 3.In the experiment section , the authors only compare the proposed algorithm with [ 2 ] in terms of \u201c optimal \u201d attack and robust training . However , there are a lot of works that attack the observations of a fixed policy [ 3,4,5 ] . And more importantly , [ 6 ] also proposes to train a robust agent under adversarial attacks . It will be more convincing if the authors empirically or theoretically compare with some of these potential baselines . 4.The computational complexity / sample complexity of the proposed ATLA might be problematic , as for each iteration of learning , the adversary needs to solve a new MDP , which makes the proposed robust training less practical to use . Minor comments : - This paper sometimes uses the phrase `` training time attack '' to refer adversarial attacks , which is misleading , e.g.the second contribution , the third paragraph of related work . Training-time attack usually refers to poisoning attack , which changes the training dataset and alters the learned policy , different from the scenario in this paper where an adversary wants to fool a fixed policy .

Our paper already includes the stronger multi-step attack in [ 6 ] ( named as \u201c critic attack \u201d ) [ 4 ] proposed \u201c strategically-timed attack \u201d and the \u201c enchanting attack \u201d . The strategically-timed attack used a multi-step gradient based attack similar to [ 6 ] for attacking only partial frames to avoid detection , so this is a weaker attack with more constraints for the attacker . In our paper , all attacks are applied in every step , which is stronger than the threat model used in [ 4 ] . The goal of the enchanting attack is to lure the agent into a certain state , and it is not directly minimizing cumulative reward . Since our goal is to reveal the agent \u2019 s true robustness , we always evaluate the agent under the strongest possible attack that reduces agent reward most , so we did not use attacks in [ 4 ] . [ 5 ] proposed \u201c snooping attack \u201d , which is a black-box adversarial attack . As suggested by the reviewer , we implemented Snooping attack in [ 5 ] and tested it on all our agents . The results are shown in Table 1 ( main text ) and Table 3 ( appendix ) . From the results , we can see that Snooping attack has strength similar to the MAD attack , and is typically worse than RS attack and the \u201c optimal \u201d attack proposed in this paper . Thus , the main conclusion and evaluation results do not change after adding this new attack into comparison . 3.2 Comparison to [ 6 ] for robust training under attack : As suggested by the reviewer , we added a comparison to [ 6 ] , which uses the critic attack for adversarial training . The results are included in Table 2 ( main text ) and Table 3 ( appendix ) . We find that this method can not reliably improve robustness under our suite of strong attacks . The reason is that the critic attack is a relatively weak adversary , so the agent learned with a weak adversary can not defend against a stronger adversary . 4.Sample complexity : We want to emphasize that just as in supervised learning settings ( e.g. , image classification ) , adversarial training can significantly increase computational complexity , e.g. , [ 7 ] must be trained with more epochs than ordinary training to converge . There is no free lunch for adversarial robustness [ 8 ] . Our proposed method usually requires up to 5X more iterations compared to vanilla PPO agents , which is comparable to adversarial training for supervised learning . We believe the computational complexity of our method is reasonable , especially considering that the field of adversarial robustness in DRL is relatively new . Further reducing the computational or sample complexity of adversarial training in RL setting is a good future direction . 5.Phrase `` training time attack '' \uff1a Thank you for pointing out this potential confusion . We have changed `` training time attack '' to `` adversarial training '' in our paper and made it clear that we use adversarial attacks on state observations to improve the robustness of the agent during test time . Conclusion : We hope Reviewer 4 can re-evaluate our paper based on our new empirical results ( snooping attacks [ 5 ] and an adversarial training baseline [ 6 ] ) and clarifications on our Lemma , Algorithm , and sample complexity .

Building on the results of ( Zhang et al. , 2020 ) , the paper proposes a new learning framework ( ATLA ) , that simultaneously trains a ( strong ) adversary and a ( robust ) deep RL agent . The paper showcases the importance of the new framework through extensive experimental evaluation . Reasons for score : Overall , I find the paper to be an interesting read and its contribution relevant to the line of work on adversarial attacks in RL . The contributions of the paper seem non-trivial , and include a framework for designing optimal attacks and training procedures that can optimize for robustness . As shown by the experiments , the proposed solution leads to significant increase in performance compared to state of the art baselines . These results complement those of ( Zhang et al. , 2020 ) . Nonetheless , the presentation of the paper could be improved in terms of clarity . Some parts of the paper could be reorganized and explained in more detail . Suggestion for improvements and questions are outlined below . Clarity : The paper is overall enjoyable to read , but some parts are not clearly/precisely written . There are quite a few typos , some of which might be important for understanding the content . I did not follow equation ( 2 ) , which seems to contain typos . Could you explain in more detail the loss function defined with this equation ? Furthermore , notation in the paragraph before section 3.1 is partly confusing , in particular , $ \\nu $ seems to be a deterministic function , but then for observation $ \\hat s $ we have $ \\hat s \\sim \\nu ( s ) $ indicating that $ \\nu ( s ) $ might be a distribution from which we sample $ \\hat s \\sim \\nu ( s ) $ . I would also suggest reorganizing the content related to Figure 1 , which is introduced in section 1 , but only explained in detail in section 3.1 . Related Work : The related work is generally covered well , but it could be expanded by providing some connection to the line of work that studies policy teaching and policy poisoning attacks in RL .

'Policy Poisoning in Batch Reinforcement Learning and Control ' , Rakhsha et al. , 'Policy Teaching via Environment Poisoning : Training-time Adversarial Attacks against Reinforcement Learning ' , etc . ) ? Experiments : I 'm wondering to what extent are the results for different methods in Table 2 comparable . Namely , the methods seem to be based on different architectures , so it is not immediately clear what conclusions should be drawn from these results . Surprisingly , the discussion on page 8 does not seem to compare the results of ATLA-PPO ( MLP ) and SA-PPO . Could you elaborate more on these results and make relative comparison ? Furthermore , in the following sentence : 'For reproducibility , for each setup we train at least 5 ( up to 21 ) agents , attack all of them and report the one with median robustness . ' - why is there discrepancy between different setups in the number of trained agents ?", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "reply_text": "We greatly appreciate the helpful comments from the reviewer . They help us improve our paper a lot . We now answer the reviewer \u2019 s questions below : 1 . Equation ( 2 ) : Thank you for pointing this out . We have updated Eq.2 ( now becomes Eq.3 ) , fixed the typos , and added more explanations . 2.Deterministic or stochastic $ \\nu $ : Sorry for mixing notations here . We have updated our paper and now we keep using the stochastic adversarial notation . 3.Figure 1 : We have improved the caption below Figure 1 to make this example more self-contained and also added pointers to later sections in Figure 1 . We hope this figure can be a good example in the Introduction to explain that the robustness issue is not just in deep reinforcement learning with function approximation . 4.Policy teaching and policy poisoning : We really appreciate the provided references and we have cited them in the related work section . Policy teaching and policy poisoning manipulate the reward or cost signal during agent training time to induce the desired agent policy . Essentially , policy teaching is a training time \u201c attack \u201d with perturbed rewards from the environments ( which can be analogous to data poisoning attacks in supervised learning settings ) , while our goal is to train a robust agent against test time ( not training time ) adversarial attacks on state observations ( not rewards ) . 5.Discussions in experiments : Sorry for the confusion . We included both MLP and LSTM agents because in Section 3.2 , we show that learning an agent under adversary is a POMDP problem , so a history-dependent policy ( LSTM policy ) can potentially perform better . We observe that ATLA ( LSTM ) overall outperforms ATLP ( MLP ) in experiments , matching our theoretical observation in Section 3.2 . We have updated the paragraph on discussion experiment results to cover all methods , and structured this paragraph to clearly distinguish between MLP and LSTM models . 6.Discrepancy in the number of trained agents This is mainly due to computational constraints . To ensure reproducibility , we train each setting multiple times , and each agent is evaluated by hundreds of independent adversaries ( because some attacks have hyperparameters , and we run a grid search to train a large number of adversaries ) . We report the agent with median robustness overall repeated training runs . The computation cost for training and attacks is high so we were not able to repeat all settings by 21 times . During the discussion period , we trained more agents and now almost every setting has 21 agents . We find that the median reward under attack is roughly the same as the ones reported in our paper , so our main results are reproducible and remain unchanged . We thank the reviewer again for the very helpful comments , and please feel free to let us know if any of your concerns are still not addressed or if you have further questions ."}, {"review_id": "sCZbhBvqQaU-3", "review_text": "The authors presents how to learn optimal adversary following the state-adversarial Markov decision process ( SA-MDP ) , and also proposes alternating training with learned attacks ( ATLA ) framework that trains the optimal adversary online together with the agent to improve the robustness of the DRL agent . Experiment result shows that ATLA outperforms the explicit regularization based methods . Overall I think the paper is well-written and clearly illustrated the methodology . The experimental results are mostly comprehensive . The contribution is clear . I still have a few questions and concerns below : 1 ) It is a natural and interesting idea to use alternating training to optimize both the adversary and the agent online . In terms of finding the ( near ) optimal adversary following the theory of SA-MDP , the authors argue that because of using `` function approximator to learn the agent so it \u2019 s no longer optimal '' . However , it seems unclear how much the approximation affects the optimality . For tabular case instead of DRL , is it possible to really find the optimal adversary , and if so , how ? How far away the learned strong adversary from the real optimal one ? Indeed from experiments the learned adversary can better attack than other baselines , but it would still be important to understand the advantage and room to improve in a principled way . For finding the policy , it is understandable that because of the difficulty of solving POMDP , this paper does not solve the optimal policy . 2 ) ATLA-PPO + SA Reg further improves performance over ATLA-PPO in experiments . This seems to suggest that the advantage of ATLA-PPO and SA Reg are complementary . Does the regularization on the function approximator provides additional robustness or it covers the error of function approximator using LSTM ? Is it possible to understand this in experiments ? 3 ) Are the adversary and the agent both getting stronger over time ? The paper only showed final results and did not show the running time result . Hypothetically because of the alternating training , the adversary and the agent should both be improved and it would be interesting to verify this in experiments .", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "reply_text": "We really appreciate the detailed review comments and we provide our response below . 1.Optimality under approximation This is a very good question , but unfortunately , it is a very challenging question and beyond the reach of our paper . In section 3.1 , we formulate the learning problem of an optimal adversary as finding an optimal policy on MDP . Thus , finding the optimal adversary itself becomes a general RL problem . When a deep neural network function approximator is used to solve an RL problem , currently very limited theoretical study is done to show the gap between the learned policy and the optimal one , and in some cases , even the optimal policy itself is beyond our reach so it is very hard to compare the two . For example , although we can combine RL with function approximators to solve the game of Go and outperform top-level human players , it is unclear to us what is the optimal policy for Go and how far our currently learned agents are away from it . 2.Improvement from SA Reg As the reviewer correctly pointed out , ATLA and SA-reg are two complementary methods . Firstly , the SA regularization helps model robustness , as Theorem 5 suggested in Zhang et al.Secondly , as a regularization , SA-reg makes function approximators more smooth so they become more robust under small perturbations and have less \u201c errors \u201d . Both of the two factors are effective and it is hard to distinguish them from each other . When combined with our ATLA framework , we believe the smoothness caused by the regularizer might be more important , as our ATLA framework does not explicitly encourage smoothness . In high dimensional environments like Ant where smoothness is more critical , we can see the ATLA with SA-reg works more effectively than the ones without SA-reg . We added this discussion in Section 4 . 3.Adversary and agent get stronger over time We provide additional results on evaluating agents during training . For our best setting ( ATLA LSTM + SA reg ) we evaluate the model checkpoints with RS attack at 20 % , 40 % , 60 % , 80 % training steps . The results are provided in Table 4 in Appendix A.3 . The overall trend is that agents are getting stronger over time , achieving better robustness in later checkpoints . It is unsure how to fairly evaluate the adversary during training since intermediate adversaries are closely related to their corresponding training agents . Similarly , it does not quite make sense to evaluate the accuracy of the discriminator in GAN training , as the discriminator is specific to the generator under training , and what we care about is the performance of the generator ( analogous to the agent in our setting ) . We can access the quality of the adversary by evaluating the robustness of the agent - if the agent is robust to strong adversarial attacks such as RS attacks , the adversary should also be strong , otherwise , the agent can not learn to be robust . We included an evaluation of the agents in Appendix A.3 , as discussed above .

We have updated our paper and now we keep using the stochastic adversarial notation . 3.Figure 1 : We have improved the caption below Figure 1 to make this example more self-contained and also added pointers to later sections in Figure 1 . We hope this figure can be a good example in the Introduction to explain that the robustness issue is not just in deep reinforcement learning with function approximation . 4.Policy teaching and policy poisoning : We really appreciate the provided references and we have cited them in the related work section . Policy teaching and policy poisoning manipulate the reward or cost signal during agent training time to induce the desired agent policy . Essentially , policy teaching is a training time \u201c attack \u201d with perturbed rewards from the environments ( which can be analogous to data poisoning attacks in supervised learning settings ) , while our goal is to train a robust agent against test time ( not training time ) adversarial attacks on state observations ( not rewards ) . 5.Discussions in experiments : Sorry for the confusion . We included both MLP and LSTM agents because in Section 3.2 , we show that learning an agent under adversary is a POMDP problem , so a history-dependent policy ( LSTM policy ) can potentially perform better . We observe that ATLA ( LSTM ) overall outperforms ATLP ( MLP ) in experiments , matching our theoretical observation in Section 3.2 . We have updated the paragraph on discussion experiment results to cover all methods , and structured this paragraph to clearly distinguish between MLP and LSTM models . 6.Discrepancy in the number of trained agents This is mainly due to computational constraints . To ensure reproducibility , we train each setting multiple times , and each agent is evaluated by hundreds of independent adversaries ( because some attacks have hyperparameters , and we run a grid search to train a large number of adversaries ) . We report the agent with median robustness overall repeated training runs . The computation cost for training and attacks is high so we were not able to repeat all settings by 21 times . During the discussion period , we trained more agents and now almost every setting has 21 agents . We find that the median reward under attack is roughly the same as the ones reported in our paper , so our main results are reproducible and remain unchanged . We thank the reviewer again for the very helpful comments , and please feel free to let us know if any of your concerns are still not addressed or if you have further questions ."}, "3": {"review_id": "sCZbhBvqQaU-3", "review_text": "The authors presents how to learn optimal adversary following the state-adversarial Markov decision process ( SA-MDP ) , and also proposes alternating training with learned attacks ( ATLA ) framework that trains the optimal adversary online together with the agent to improve the robustness of the DRL agent . Experiment result shows that ATLA outperforms the explicit regularization based methods . Overall I think the paper is well-written and clearly illustrated the methodology . The experimental results are mostly comprehensive . The contribution is clear . I still have a few questions and concerns below : 1 ) It is a natural and interesting idea to use alternating training to optimize both the adversary and the agent online . In terms of finding the ( near ) optimal adversary following the theory of SA-MDP , the authors argue that because of using `` function approximator to learn the agent so it \u2019 s no longer optimal '' . However , it seems unclear how much the approximation affects the optimality . For tabular case instead of DRL , is it possible to really find the optimal adversary , and if so , how ? How far away the learned strong adversary from the real optimal one ? Indeed from experiments the learned adversary can better attack than other baselines , but it would still be important to understand the advantage and room to improve in a principled way . For finding the policy , it is understandable that because of the difficulty of solving POMDP , this paper does not solve the optimal policy . 2 ) ATLA-PPO + SA Reg further improves performance over ATLA-PPO in experiments . This seems to suggest that the advantage of ATLA-PPO and SA Reg are complementary . Does the regularization on the function approximator provides additional robustness or it covers the error of function approximator using LSTM ? Is it possible to understand this in experiments ? 3 ) Are the adversary and the agent both getting stronger over time ? The paper only showed final results and did not show the running time result . Hypothetically because of the alternating training , the adversary and the agent should both be improved and it would be interesting to verify this in experiments .", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "reply_text": "We really appreciate the detailed review comments and we provide our response below . 1.Optimality under approximation This is a very good question , but unfortunately , it is a very challenging question and beyond the reach of our paper . In section 3.1 , we formulate the learning problem of an optimal adversary as finding an optimal policy on MDP . Thus , finding the optimal adversary itself becomes a general RL problem . When a deep neural network function approximator is used to solve an RL problem , currently very limited theoretical study is done to show the gap between the learned policy and the optimal one , and in some cases , even the optimal policy itself is beyond our reach so it is very hard to compare the two . For example , although we can combine RL with function approximators to solve the game of Go and outperform top-level human players , it is unclear to us what is the optimal policy for Go and how far our currently learned agents are away from it . 2.Improvement from SA Reg As the reviewer correctly pointed out , ATLA and SA-reg are two complementary methods . Firstly , the SA regularization helps model robustness , as Theorem 5 suggested in Zhang et al.Secondly , as a regularization , SA-reg makes function approximators more smooth so they become more robust under small perturbations and have less \u201c errors \u201d . Both of the two factors are effective and it is hard to distinguish them from each other . When combined with our ATLA framework , we believe the smoothness caused by the regularizer might be more important , as our ATLA framework does not explicitly encourage smoothness . In high dimensional environments like Ant where smoothness is more critical , we can see the ATLA with SA-reg works more effectively than the ones without SA-reg . We added this discussion in Section 4 . 3.Adversary and agent get stronger over time We provide additional results on evaluating agents during training . For our best setting ( ATLA LSTM + SA reg ) we evaluate the model checkpoints with RS attack at 20 % , 40 % , 60 % , 80 % training steps . The results are provided in Table 4 in Appendix A.3 . The overall trend is that agents are getting stronger over time , achieving better robustness in later checkpoints . It is unsure how to fairly evaluate the adversary during training since intermediate adversaries are closely related to their corresponding training agents . Similarly , it does not quite make sense to evaluate the accuracy of the discriminator in GAN training , as the discriminator is specific to the generator under training , and what we care about is the performance of the generator ( analogous to the agent in our setting ) . We can access the quality of the adversary by evaluating the robustness of the agent - if the agent is robust to strong adversarial attacks such as RS attacks , the adversary should also be strong , otherwise , the agent can not learn to be robust . We included an evaluation of the agents in Appendix A.3 , as discussed above . We thank you again for your helpful comments and please let us know if you have any additional questions or concerns ."}}
