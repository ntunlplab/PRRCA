The method essentially involves performing PCA on the latent representations to find directions that maximize variance . The authors argue that this results in more interpretable directions . The method is applied on top of a VAE model ( OPTIMUS ) , and the authors argue that different directions discovered by PCA correspond to interpretable concepts . - Strengths - - The method is simple , and can be applied on top of existing text VAEs . - Learning interpretable and controllable generative models of text is an important research area , and this paper contributes to this important field . - Weaknesses - - There are only mostly qualitative results presented . While I agree that performing quantitative results is difficult with this style of work , the authors could have ( for example ) adopted methods from the style transfer literature to show quantitative results .
