The proposed regularization strategy enforces that a discriminator or a given classifier should be invariant to small perturbations on the data manifold z. It is empirically shown that naively enforcing such a constraint by randomly adding noise to z could lead to under-smoothing or over-smoothing in some cases which can harm the final classification performance. Consequently, the proposed regularization technique takes a step of tunable size in the direction of the manifold gradient, which has the effect of smoothing along the direction of the gradient while ignoring its norm. Extensive experiments have been conducted, showing that the proposed approach outperforms or is comparable with recent state-of-the-art approaches on cifar 10, especially in presence of fewer labelled data points. On SVHN however, the proposed approach fails in comparison with (Kumar et al 2017) but performs better than other approaches. Furthermore, it has been shown that adding the proposed manifold regularization technique to the training of GAN greatly improves the image quality of generated images (in terms of FID scores and inception scores). Also, by combining the proposed regularizer with a classical supervised classifier (via pre-training a GAN and using it for regularization) decreases classification error by 2 to 3%. Finally, it has also been shown that after training a GAN using the manifold regularization, the algorithm is able to produce similar images giving a low enough perturbation of the data manifold z. Overall, this paper is well written and show significant improvements especially for image generation. However, the novelty is rather limited as similar ideas have been undertaken (e.g., Mescheder et al 2018), but in different contexts. The paper would be improved if the following points are taken into account: A comparison with Graph Convolutional Network based techniques seems appropriate (e.g. Kipf and Welling 2017).

In response to your comment that `` similar ideas have been undertaken ( e.g. , Mescheder et al 2018 ) , but in different contexts '' we would like to take this opportunity to clarify the novelty of our approach . First , with regards to ( Mescheder et al 2018 ) , our method is not simply the application of existing gradient penalties ( GPs ) in the context of semi-supervised learning . Our approach is conceptually different since the regularizer proposed by ( Mescheder et al 2018 ) is an ( isotropic ) ambient regularizer in the input space , whereas the regularizer we used performs ( anisotropic ) smoothing on the manifold parametrized by the latent generative model . We believe we are the first to show the benefits of anisotropic Jacobian regularizers in the context of semi-supervised learning . Moreover , an important contribution of our work is the efficient computation of such gradient penalties in the context of semi-supervised learning . Current application of such penalties uses the exact Jacobian which is especially computationally expensive in the case of semi-supervised learning as it is now a tensor ( one matrix per class in the case of Improved GAN ) , which quickly becomes intractable with large numbers of classes . We proposed and demonstrated the effectiveness of an efficient ( non-obvious ) approximation of the Jacobian-based regularizer which significantly accelerates training .

Defining the graph structure is not trivial for the image datasets commonly used as benchmarks . In this light , one of the advantages of our approach is that the manifold ( graph structure ) is implicitly learned by the GAN , thus avoiding the need to explicitly define it . That said , it is an interesting direction for future work and we thank the reviewer for the suggestion . Q : `` How do the FID/Inception improvements compare to ( Mescheder et al 2018 ) ? '' A : We can not directly compare our image generation scores with those reported in ( Merscheder et al 2018 ) as we used different GAN architectures ; for reference , they reported an Inception score of 6.2 . We have updated the paper with Inception/FID scores from the ambient regularizer on CIFAR-10 ( Table 4 ) , which is an approximation of the proposed regularizer in ( Merscheder et al.2018 ) using stochastic finite differences . As mentioned earlier , it is not practical to compare the non-approximated regularizer due to the substantial increase in computational complexity in the semi-supervised GAN setting . We observe that ambient regularization gives better image generation scores ; however it does not perform as well on semi-supervised learning . This tradeoff between image generation and semi-supervised learning performance was previously reported in ( Salimans et al. , 2016 ) `` Improved Methods for Training GANs '' .

They proposed a manifold regularization by approximating the Laplacian norm using the stochastic finite difference. The motivation is that making the classifier invariant to perturbations along the manifold is more reasonable than random perturbations. The idea is to use GAN to learn the manifold. The difficulty is that (the gradient of) Laplacian norm is impractical to compute for DNNs. They stated that another approximation of the manifold gradient, i.e. adding Gaussian noise \\delta to z directly (||f(z) - f(g(z+\\delta))||_F) has some drawbacks when the magnitude of noise is too large or too small. The authors proposed another improved gradient approximation by first computing the normalized manifold gradient \\bar r(z) and then adding a tunable magnitude of \\bar r(z) to g(z), i.e., ||f(z) - f(g(z) +\\epsilon \\bar r(z) )||_F.

The performance of the proposed method is worse than the previous work but they claimed \"state-of-the-art\" results. The paper also misses several powerful baselines of semi-supervised learning, e.g. [1,2]. The experimental results are not very convincing because many importance baselines are neglected. - The paper does not have a significant novel contribution, but rather extends GANs (improved-GAN mostly) with a manifold regularization, which has been explored in many other works Kumar et al.
