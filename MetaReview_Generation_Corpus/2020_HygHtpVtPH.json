The authors responded to all the comments, added more experiments, and as reviewer 2 noted, the method is interesting because of its ability to handle local noise. Despite the author's helpful responses, the ratings were not increased, and it is still hard to assess the exact extent of how the proposed approach improves over state of the art.   Because some concerns remained, and due to a large number of stronger papers, this paper was not accepted at this time.", "reviews": [{"review_id": "HygHtpVtPH-0", "review_text": "This paper proposes a denoising auto-encoder where the input image is corrupted by adding noises to its Laplacian pyramid representation. Then a DAE is trained to predict the original data and learn a good representation of the data. By corrupting the Laplacian representation, which is multi-scale, the corruption of the image is not local and thus more robust representations are learned. I personally like this idea. However, it seems a simple extension of the classical DAE. 1. Is it possible to generalize this idea to other representations of the images such as wavelets or sift, or the representations learned by other neural networks? It seems that you can add corruptions to any image representations as long as you can reconstruct the image from the representation.

Thanks for the suggestions . We provide the results of the two suggested settings in Fig.3 ( left ) and Sec.4.2 in the revision . Generally , when applying LapDAE to images with corruption on the input space ( the first suggested setting ) , the reconstruction is slightly worse than LapDAE with corruption on the Laplacian space , while still much better than the conventional DAE . On the other hand , when applying DAE to images with corruption on the Laplacian space ( the second suggested setting ) , the reconstruction is improved a bit but worse than the proposed LapDAE . Note that our LapDAE is not trained to denoise spatial noise on the input space but to capture more non-local context information . This is supported by the results where the digits are well reconstructed even with some minor noise in the background . 2.How does the corrupted set C been selected ? Moreover , how does the selected layer in the Laplacian pyramid effects the performance ? For example , is there a difference in terms of performance of the model when training on LPS4 versus LPS8 ? The corruption set C can be any types of corruptions theoretically . For simplicity , in this paper we choose the random Gaussian noise ( Sec.4.1 ) .As shown in Fig.1 ( a ) and discussed in Sec.3.2 , corruption applied to higher levels of the pyramid affects lager spatial scales of the image while that applied to lower levels affects more local area . In the proposed method , we randomly select the levels where the corruption applied to . As a result , the proposed model is able to capture both local and non-local representations through the network optimization . We empirically found that the model performs worse if only apply the corruption on a single level ( e.g. , LPS4 or LPS8 ) and it will degrade to the DAE if the corruption is applied at the lowest level ( i.e. , original image ) . The model trained on LPS4 performs slightly worse than that trained on LPS8 for deeper layer ( e.g. , conv5 ) representation learning while comparable for shallower layer ( e.g. , conv1 ) . 3.The transformation technique seems to be very helpful for the performance , is it possible to combine it with other benchmark methods like RotNet or Counting ? Yes , we believe our technique can be easily combined with other methods like RotNet and Counting , as the proposed technique makes no assumption of the pretext task and thus would not affect the pipeline of other benchmark methods . However , it is difficult to enumerate all possible combinations ( each setting has to train a separate model for each dataset ) in one single paper and is out-of-scope for our work . Due to the time limit , we perform an initial experiment of combining our technique with the RotNet . Till the time of the revision submission , the preliminary result shows that the proposed LapDAE is able to improve the performance of RotNet as well : ( 19.0 , 31.9 , 39.1 , 38.6 , 37.0 ) compared to ( 18.8 , 31.7 , 38.7 , 38.2 , 36.5 ) for the ImageNet performance in Table 1 .
