Therefore , I have reduced my score . Summary : The paper studies the well-known Nesterov 's accelerated gradient method and shows the rate of convergence to the solution of an ordinary differential equation recently proposed by [ Su et al , 2014 ] . Motivated by the proof , the authors then derive a new accelerated method with a faster rate of convergence than the original Nesterov 's method , which is shown to be more stable than the original Nesterov 's method when the step size is large . The method is combined with the proximal operator into a new algorithm referred to as modified FISTA , which is then applied to the matrix completion problem . Strengths : - The paper proves the convergence rate of Nesterov 's method to the ODE proposed by [ Su et al , 2014 ] . This proof then motivates them to derive a new faster accelerated method where the truncation error has a higher order of $ O ( h^4 ) $ compared to $ O ( h^3 ) $ in case of Nesterov 's method . - It is shown in two simple examples that the new method is more stable as it can work with larger step sizes . - The method is applied to a matrix completion problem , where it is shown to have faster convergence than standard FISTA and Nesterov 's gradient method . Concerns : - In Section 2.2. , the purpose of Lemma 1 and Lemma 2 is not clear without looking into the proof of Theorem 2 in the supplementary material . The flow of the paper could be improved if an intuition was given of which role they play in the proof of Theorem 2 . - Similarly , to understand the motivation for the derivation of the new accelerated method in Section 3 , one is required to look at the proof of the convergence in the supplement .

I suggest the authors to address the above-mentioned concerns in their revision . I think it would be great if one can show directly the connection between the discretization truncation error and better algorithm performance . Note that , however , already Nesterov 's methods have optimal performance . Probably , a significant experimental evidence will help here .", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "We thank you for your thought-provoking comments .

Firstly , we believe that our theory means convergence . We would like to give a short explanation . Dynamic system theory guarantees that the continuous flow $ x ( t ) $ ( solution of the differential equation $ \\ddot { x } +\\frac { 3 } { t } \\dot { x } +\\nabla F ( x ) =0 $ ) converges to an optimal point $ x^ * $ as $ t\\to\\infty $ . So for any small $ \\varepsilon $ , we can find a constant $ T $ such that for $ t\\geq T $ , $ |x ( t ) -x^ * | < \\varepsilon $ always satisfies . Theorem 2 shows that $ x_n\\ ; ( n=T/h ) $ converges to $ x ( T ) $ as $ h\\to\\infty $ . So for sufficiently small $ h $ , the distance between $ x_n $ and $ x^ * $ is not larger than $ \\varepsilon $ . Secondly , we agree that the convergence rate of the new method is important . Since the performance of our new method is better , we believe that our method also achieves the optimal convergence rate $ \\mathcal { O } ( n^ { -2 } ) $ as Nesterov 's method does . Furthermore , due to existence of a $ 1/s $ term in the convergence rate of Nesterov 's method , we believe that our new method improves the convergence by working with larger step size $ s $ . We leave this point for further research . Thank you again for your suggestions , and we would appreciate further feedback ."}, "3": {"review_id": "0DALDI-xyW4-3", "review_text": "Review : This paper refines the the truncation error analysis for discretizing the ODE to obtain accelerated optimization method .

From my understanding , truncation error is different from the convergence rate . What does Theorem 3 really imply here ? It seems to me that Theorem 3 does not guarantee that there is an improvement in the convergence rate .

It seems to me that Theorem 3 does not guarantee that there is an improvement in the convergence rate . A rigorous quantification of the convergence rate needs to be provided to justify the claim `` the proposed method converges faster . '' The algorithm performance is improved because our new algorithm can work with larger step size when converges to one optimal point $ x^ * $ along the continuous flow $ x ( t ) $ which is also the limit flow of Nesterov 's method . As a result , our new method is more stable and converges faster . We give a theoretical proof of the chosen of larger step size via absolutely stable theory in subsection 3.3 ( $ 4/3 $ for Nesterov 's method and $ 4 $ for our new method ) .

Thank you for your insightful suggestion . We agree that this is the core issue of our paper and related works . In this paper , we find that algorithm with higher truncation order will converge to the continuous limit faster , thus is more stable ( subsection 3.2 ) . We think that our explanation can partly answer this question , but a precise solution needs further work . Thanks again for the detailed review and we would appreciate further feedback ."}}
