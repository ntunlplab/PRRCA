The revisions have addressed many of the concerns about quality, clarity, and significance. The paper gives an end to end explanation in Bayesian terms of generalization in neural networks using SGD.\n\nHowever, it is my opinion that Bayesian statistics is not, at present, a theory that can be used to explain why a learning algorithm works. The Bayesian theory is too optimistic: you introduce a prior and model and then trust both implicitly. Relative to any particular prior and model (likelihood), the Bayesian posterior is the optimal summary of the data, but if either part is misspecified, then the Bayesian posterior carries no optimality guarantee. The prior is chosen for convenience here. And the model (a neural network feeding into cross entropy) is clearly misspecified.\n\nHowever, there are ways to sidestep both these issues using a frequentist theory closely related to Bayes, which can explain generalization. Indeed, you cite a recent such paper by Dzugate and Roy who use PAC-Bayes. However, you citation is disappointingly misleading: a reader would never know that these authors are also responding to Zhang, have already proposed to explain \"broad minima\" in (PAC-)Bayesian terms, and then even get nonvacuous bounds. (The connection between PAC-bayes and marginl likelihood is explained by Germain et al. \"PAC-Bayesian Theory Meets Bayesian Inference\").  Dzugate et al don't propose to explain why SGD finds such \"good\" minima. So I would say, your work provides the missing half of their argument. This work deserves more prominent placement and shouldn't be buried on page 5. Indeed, it should appear in the introduction and a proper description of the relationship should be given.

It does so from the perspective of \"Bayesian model comparison\", where two models are compared based on their \"marginal likelihood\" (aka, their \"evidence\" --- the expected probability of the training data under the model, when parameters are drawn from the prior). It first shows that a simple weakly regularized (linear) logistic regression model over 200 dimensional data can perfectly memorize a random training set with 200 points, while also generalizing well when the class labels are not random (eg, when a simple linear model explains the class labels); this provides a much simpler example of a model generalizing well in spite of high capacity, relative to the experiments presented by Zhang et al (2017). It shows that in this very simple setting, the \"evidence\" of a model correlates well with the test accuracy, and thus could explain this phenomena (evidence is low for model trained on random data, but high for model trained on real data). The paper goes on to show that if the evidence is approximated using a second order Taylor expansion of the cost function around a minimia $w_0$, then the evidence is controlled by the cost at the minimum, and by the logarithm of the ratio of the curvature at the minimum compared to the regularization constant (eg, standard deviation of gaussian prior). Thus, Bayesian evidence prefers minima that are both deep and broad. This provides a way of comparing models in a way which is independent of the model parametrization (unfortunately, however, computing the evidence is intractable for large networks). The paper then discusses how SGD can be seen as an algorithmic way of finding minima with large \"evidence\" --- the \"noise\" in the gradient estimation helps the model avoid \"sharp\" minima, while the gradient helps the model find \"deep\" minima. The paper shows that SGD can be understood using stochastic differential equations, where the noise scale is approximately aN/((1-m)B) (a = learning rate, N = size of training set, B = batch size, m = momentum). It argues that because there should be an optimal noise scale (which maximizes test performance), the batch size should be taken proportional to the learning rate, as well as the training set size, and proportional to 1/(1-m). These scaling rules are confirmed experimentally (DNN trained on MNIST). Thus, this Bayesian perspective can also help explain the observation that models trained with smaller batch sizes (noisier gradient estimates) often generalize better than those with larger batch sizes (Kesker et al, 2016). These scaling rules provide guidance on how to increase the batch size, which is desirable for increasing the parralelism of SGD training. Review: Quality: The quality of the work is high. Experiments and analysis are both presented clearly. Clarity: The paper is relatively clear, though some of the connections between the different parts of the paper felt unclear to me: 1) It would be nice if the paper were to explain, from a theoretical perspective, why large evidence should correspond to better generalization, or provide an overview of the work which has shown this (eg, Rissanen, 1983). 2) Could margin-based generalization bounds explain the superior generalization performance of the linear model trained on random vs. non-random data? It seems to me that the model trained on meaningful data should have a larger margin. 3) The connection between the work on Bayesian evidence, and the work on SGD, felt very informal. The link seems to be purely intuitive (SGD should converge to minima with high evidence, because its updates are noisy). Can this be formalized? There is a footnote on page 7 regarding Bayesian posterior sampling -- I think this should be brought into the body of the paper, and explained in more detail. 4) The paper does not give any background on stochastic differential equations, and why there should be an optimal noise scale 'g', which remains constant during the stochastic process, for converging to a minima with high evidene. Are there any theoretical results which can be leveraged from the stochastic processes literature? For example, are there results which prove anything regarding the convergence of a stochastic process under different amounts of noise? 5) It was unclear to me why momentum was used in the MNIST experiments. This seems to complicate the experimental setting. Does the generalization gap not appear when no momentum is used? Also, why is the same learning rate used for both small and large batch training for Figures 3 and 4? If the learning rate were optimized together with batch size (eg, keeping aN/B constant), would the generalization gap still appear? Figure 5a seems to suggest that it would not appear (peaks appear to all have the same test accuracy). 6) It was unclear to me whether the analysis of SGD as a stochastic differential equation with noise scale aN/((1-m)B) was a contribution of this paper. It would be good if it were made clearer which part of the mathematical analysis in sections 2 and 5 are original. 7) Some small feedback: The notation $< x_i > = 0$ and $< x_i^2 > = 1$ is not explained. Is each feature being normalized to be zero mean, unit variance, or is each training example being normalized? Originality: The works seems to be relatively original combination of ideas from Bayesian evidence, to deep neural network research. However, I am not familiar enough with the literature on Bayesian evidence, or the literature on sharp/broad minima, and their generalization properties, to be able to confidently say how original this work is. Significance: I believe that this work is quite significant in two different ways: 1) \"Bayesian evidence\" provides a nice way of understanding why neural nets might generalize well, which could lead to further theoretical contributions. 2) The scaling rules described in section 5 could help practitioners use much larger batch sizes during training, by simultaneously increasing the learning rate, the training set size, and/or the momentum parameter. This could help parallelize neural network training considerably. Some things which could limit the significance of the work: 1) The paper does not provide a way of measuring the (approximate) evidence of a model. It simply says it is prohibitively expensive to compute for large models. Can the \"Gaussian approximation\" to the evidence (equation 10) be approximated efficiently for large neural networks? 2) The paper does not prove that SGD converges to models of high evidence, or formally relate the noise scale 'g' to the quality of the converged model, or relate the evidence of the model to its generalization performance. Overall, I feel the strengths of the paper outweight its weaknesses. I think that the paper would be made stronger and clearer if the questions I raised above are addressed prior to publication.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "reply_text": "We thank the referee for their positive assessment of our work . Regarding the originality of our work , we believe our paper makes three main contributions : 1 ) We show that well-established Bayesian principles can resolve a number of active debates in the deep learning community ( generalization/sharp minima/reparameterization/SGD batch size ) . 2 ) We derive a novel closed form expression for the \u201c noise scale \u201d of the SGD , which holds even when the covariance matrix between the gradients of different parameters is non-stationary . We exploit this expression to predict three scaling rules between the batch size , learning rate , training set size and momentum coefficient . 3 ) We verified these scaling rules empirically , and we believe they will prove extremely useful to ML practitioners . We note that while the B ~ a/ ( 1-m ) scaling rules enable us to achieve large batch training without hyper-parameter tuning , the B ~ N rule is equally valuable ; since it enables us to retrain production models on new training data without retuning the batch size . With current tools , the Gaussian approximation to the evidence can not be estimated efficiently in deep networks . However this is not in fact a major limitation , since in practical scenarios we will always rely on test sets . What is important is to build an intuition for the factors which control generalization , and to use this intuition to improve the accuracy of our models . This is why we presented generalization and the SGD in a single paper ; the intuition we gained from the approximate Bayesian evidence resolves the sharp minima debate , and the trade off between the depth and breadth of minima in the evidence explains how we should tune SGD hyper-parameters to maximize the test set accuracy . Unfortunately , one can not derive a stationary distribution for the SGD in the infinite time limit unless one imposes the unrealistic assumption that the gradient covariances are stationary . As a result , it is very challenging to formally prove that SGD converges to minima with large evidence . However our argument runs as follows : if one were to assume the covariances were stationary , one could derive a stationary distribution for the SGD in the infinite limit [ 1 ] and one could formally prove that SGD converges to models of large evidence at an optimal noise scale . While we can not formally prove this for the general case , we expect noise to have similar effects , and this matches what we observe empirically . To respond to the remaining comments : 1 ) We will add appropriate citations/discussion to the text . 2 ) We have explored the average margin of models trained on random and informative labels . We find that the margin is ~50 % larger when trained on random labels in our experiments . However unlike the evidence , the margin is not strongly correlated with either the test cross-entropy or the test accuracy . 3/4 ) See above . More specifically , the SGD would generate Bayesian posterior samples if the covariance matrix were isotropic and stationary . In this case one can prove formally that there is an optimal noise scale which biases SGD towards minima with large evidence . Our observation is that this optimal noise scale persists empirically even though the true covariance matrix is anisotropic and non-stationary . We will discuss this connection in more depth when we update the manuscript . 5 ) Yes , if we kept aN/B constant then the test set accuracy would be constant and there would not be a generalization gap ( until the learning rate a is too large , as seen in figure 5a ) ; this is a key result of the paper and the meaning of the scaling rules . We will edit the text to make this clearer . The optimal batch size only arises when one holds the learning rate constant , equivalently there would be an optimal learning rate at constant batch size . We used SGD with momentum since it is more popular than conventional SGD in practice . The results without momentum are the same ( both optimal noise scale and the scaling rules ) . 6 ) The derivation in section 2 was first performed by Mackay in 1992 . We include it here because many researchers have not seen it , and because it is central to the remainder of the paper . In addition , we demonstrate the Bayesian evidence penalizes sharp minima but is invariant to model parameterization , resolving the objections of [ 2 ] . The derivation in section 5 is original . While our treatment is similar to [ 1 ] , they assume that the covariance matrix is stationary ; we show that this assumption is not necessary , since the covariance matrix cancels out when one equates the SGD to the SDE . 7 ) We apologize for this . We normalized the expected length of the training examples , not the features .

(2016) (Understanding deep learning requires rethinking generalization). Firstly, it shows experimentally that the same effects appear even for simple models such as linear regression. It also shows that the phenomenon that sharp minima lead to worse result can be explained by Bayesian evidence. Secondly, it views SGD with different settings as introducing different levels of noises that favors different minima. With both theoretical and experimental analysis, it suggests the optimal batch-size given learning rate and training data size. The paper is well written and provides excellent insights. Pros: 1. Very well written paper with good theoretical and experimental analysis. 2. It provides useful insights of model behaviors which are attractive to a large group of people in the community. 3. The result of optimal batch size setting is useful to wide range of learning methods. Cons and mainly questions: 1. Missing related work. One important contribution of the paper is about optimal batch sizes, but related work in this direction is not discussed. There are many related works concerning adaptive batch sizes, such as [1] (a summary in section 3.2 of [2]). 2. It will be great if the author could provide some discussions with respect to the analysis of information bottleneck [3] which also discuss the generalization ability of the model. 3. The result of the optimal mini-batch size depends on the training data size. How about real online learning with streaming data where the total number of data points are unknown? 4. The results are reported mostly concerning the training iterations, not the CPU time such as in figure 3. It will be fair/interesting to see the result for CPU time where small batch maybe favored more.

In response to the remaining specific comments : Section 2 ) We state in the opening paragraph that our derivation \u201c closely [ follows ] the seminal work of David MacKay ( 1992 ) \u201d . We are happy to cite Kass and Raferty ( 1995 ) . We know this Laplacian treatment is \u201c classic \u201d . We include it because it is central to all of our observations which follow , and because most researchers in deep learning have never seen it . i ) Mackay first considers a single scalar parameter , we are following his approach . It is easy to replace the 2nd derivative by the Hessian at the end . ii ) The cross entropy measures a distance between label distributions . By one-hot label we mean that the example has a single unique label . iii ) This is a typo and we will remove it . iv ) The minimum of the cost function corresponds to the maximum of the posterior . We will make this clearer . v ) We are happy to change this as requested . vi ) We will edit the text to clarify . The evidence ratio will grow exponentially in the number of training examples , while the contribution from the prior is constant . vii ) We gave credit to Mackay , who we believe was the first to apply Bayesian model comparison to neural networks . viii ) We are happy to change this to small p. ix ) We interpret the evidence in terms of curvature to show Bayesian principles resolve the current debate in deep learning regarding sharp minima . Crucially , the Bayesian evidence is invariant to model parameterization , resolving the objections of Dinh et al . ( ICML 2017 ) . We believe this clarification is important . Section 5 ) i ) The effect of discretization is clear from figure 5a , for which there is no significant discretization error until the learning rate ~ 3 ( ie the peak test accuracy is constant as we increase the learning rate ) . After this point the test accuracy falls rapidly . We will discuss this discretization error more explicitly when we update the manuscript . We used the SDE to derive the three scaling rules . ii ) We will add a discussion of the Gaussian approximation to the appendix . However we note that we already verified all of our key practical predictions empirically . iii ) We feel this makes the following SDE derivation clearer . iv ) In equation 15 , we equate the variance of a gradient update , to the variance of the SDE , integrated over the duration of the update . Rearranging , one obtains g = \\eps N / B. v ) In equation 13 , we normalize the gradient update by the number of training examples N. The scaling rules apply to the mean gradient , not the summed gradient . vi ) Bayesian arguments explicitly support the B ~ N scaling rule . For instance , in Langevin posterior sampling , the magnitude of the noise added to the gradient update is inversely proportional to N. We will make this connection clearer ."}, "1": {"review_id": "BJij4yg0Z-1", "review_text": "Summary: This paper presents a very interesting perspective on why deep neural networks may generalize well, in spite of their high capacity (Zhang et al, 2017). It does so from the perspective of \"Bayesian model comparison\", where two models are compared based on their \"marginal likelihood\" (aka, their \"evidence\" --- the expected probability of the training data under the model, when parameters are drawn from the prior). It first shows that a simple weakly regularized (linear) logistic regression model over 200 dimensional data can perfectly memorize a random training set with 200 points, while also generalizing well when the class labels are not random (eg, when a simple linear model explains the class labels); this provides a much simpler example of a model generalizing well in spite of high capacity, relative to the experiments presented by Zhang et al (2017). It shows that in this very simple setting, the \"evidence\" of a model correlates well with the test accuracy, and thus could explain this phenomena (evidence is low for model trained on random data, but high for model trained on real data). The paper goes on to show that if the evidence is approximated using a second order Taylor expansion of the cost function around a minimia $w_0$, then the evidence is controlled by the cost at the minimum, and by the logarithm of the ratio of the curvature at the minimum compared to the regularization constant (eg, standard deviation of gaussian prior). Thus, Bayesian evidence prefers minima that are both deep and broad. This provides a way of comparing models in a way which is independent of the model parametrization (unfortunately, however, computing the evidence is intractable for large networks). The paper then discusses how SGD can be seen as an algorithmic way of finding minima with large \"evidence\" --- the \"noise\" in the gradient estimation helps the model avoid \"sharp\" minima, while the gradient helps the model find \"deep\" minima. The paper shows that SGD can be understood using stochastic differential equations, where the noise scale is approximately aN/((1-m)B) (a = learning rate, N = size of training set, B = batch size, m = momentum). It argues that because there should be an optimal noise scale (which maximizes test performance), the batch size should be taken proportional to the learning rate, as well as the training set size, and proportional to 1/(1-m). These scaling rules are confirmed experimentally (DNN trained on MNIST). Thus, this Bayesian perspective can also help explain the observation that models trained with smaller batch sizes (noisier gradient estimates) often generalize better than those with larger batch sizes (Kesker et al, 2016). These scaling rules provide guidance on how to increase the batch size, which is desirable for increasing the parralelism of SGD training. Review: Quality: The quality of the work is high. Experiments and analysis are both presented clearly. Clarity: The paper is relatively clear, though some of the connections between the different parts of the paper felt unclear to me: 1) It would be nice if the paper were to explain, from a theoretical perspective, why large evidence should correspond to better generalization, or provide an overview of the work which has shown this (eg, Rissanen, 1983). 2) Could margin-based generalization bounds explain the superior generalization performance of the linear model trained on random vs. non-random data? It seems to me that the model trained on meaningful data should have a larger margin. 3) The connection between the work on Bayesian evidence, and the work on SGD, felt very informal. The link seems to be purely intuitive (SGD should converge to minima with high evidence, because its updates are noisy). Can this be formalized? There is a footnote on page 7 regarding Bayesian posterior sampling -- I think this should be brought into the body of the paper, and explained in more detail. 4) The paper does not give any background on stochastic differential equations, and why there should be an optimal noise scale 'g', which remains constant during the stochastic process, for converging to a minima with high evidene. Are there any theoretical results which can be leveraged from the stochastic processes literature? For example, are there results which prove anything regarding the convergence of a stochastic process under different amounts of noise? 5) It was unclear to me why momentum was used in the MNIST experiments. This seems to complicate the experimental setting. Does the generalization gap not appear when no momentum is used? Also, why is the same learning rate used for both small and large batch training for Figures 3 and 4? If the learning rate were optimized together with batch size (eg, keeping aN/B constant), would the generalization gap still appear? Figure 5a seems to suggest that it would not appear (peaks appear to all have the same test accuracy). 6) It was unclear to me whether the analysis of SGD as a stochastic differential equation with noise scale aN/((1-m)B) was a contribution of this paper. It would be good if it were made clearer which part of the mathematical analysis in sections 2 and 5 are original. 7) Some small feedback: The notation $< x_i > = 0$ and $< x_i^2 > = 1$ is not explained. Is each feature being normalized to be zero mean, unit variance, or is each training example being normalized? Originality: The works seems to be relatively original combination of ideas from Bayesian evidence, to deep neural network research. However, I am not familiar enough with the literature on Bayesian evidence, or the literature on sharp/broad minima, and their generalization properties, to be able to confidently say how original this work is. Significance: I believe that this work is quite significant in two different ways: 1) \"Bayesian evidence\" provides a nice way of understanding why neural nets might generalize well, which could lead to further theoretical contributions. 2) The scaling rules described in section 5 could help practitioners use much larger batch sizes during training, by simultaneously increasing the learning rate, the training set size, and/or the momentum parameter. This could help parallelize neural network training considerably. Some things which could limit the significance of the work: 1) The paper does not provide a way of measuring the (approximate) evidence of a model. It simply says it is prohibitively expensive to compute for large models. Can the \"Gaussian approximation\" to the evidence (equation 10) be approximated efficiently for large neural networks? 2) The paper does not prove that SGD converges to models of high evidence, or formally relate the noise scale 'g' to the quality of the converged model, or relate the evidence of the model to its generalization performance. Overall, I feel the strengths of the paper outweight its weaknesses. I think that the paper would be made stronger and clearer if the questions I raised above are addressed prior to publication.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "reply_text": "We thank the referee for their positive assessment of our work . Regarding the originality of our work , we believe our paper makes three main contributions : 1 ) We show that well-established Bayesian principles can resolve a number of active debates in the deep learning community ( generalization/sharp minima/reparameterization/SGD batch size ) . 2 ) We derive a novel closed form expression for the \u201c noise scale \u201d of the SGD , which holds even when the covariance matrix between the gradients of different parameters is non-stationary . We exploit this expression to predict three scaling rules between the batch size , learning rate , training set size and momentum coefficient . 3 ) We verified these scaling rules empirically , and we believe they will prove extremely useful to ML practitioners . We note that while the B ~ a/ ( 1-m ) scaling rules enable us to achieve large batch training without hyper-parameter tuning , the B ~ N rule is equally valuable ; since it enables us to retrain production models on new training data without retuning the batch size . With current tools , the Gaussian approximation to the evidence can not be estimated efficiently in deep networks . However this is not in fact a major limitation , since in practical scenarios we will always rely on test sets . What is important is to build an intuition for the factors which control generalization , and to use this intuition to improve the accuracy of our models . This is why we presented generalization and the SGD in a single paper ; the intuition we gained from the approximate Bayesian evidence resolves the sharp minima debate , and the trade off between the depth and breadth of minima in the evidence explains how we should tune SGD hyper-parameters to maximize the test set accuracy . Unfortunately , one can not derive a stationary distribution for the SGD in the infinite time limit unless one imposes the unrealistic assumption that the gradient covariances are stationary . As a result , it is very challenging to formally prove that SGD converges to minima with large evidence . However our argument runs as follows : if one were to assume the covariances were stationary , one could derive a stationary distribution for the SGD in the infinite limit [ 1 ] and one could formally prove that SGD converges to models of large evidence at an optimal noise scale . While we can not formally prove this for the general case , we expect noise to have similar effects , and this matches what we observe empirically . To respond to the remaining comments : 1 ) We will add appropriate citations/discussion to the text . 2 ) We have explored the average margin of models trained on random and informative labels . We find that the margin is ~50 % larger when trained on random labels in our experiments . However unlike the evidence , the margin is not strongly correlated with either the test cross-entropy or the test accuracy . 3/4 ) See above . More specifically , the SGD would generate Bayesian posterior samples if the covariance matrix were isotropic and stationary . In this case one can prove formally that there is an optimal noise scale which biases SGD towards minima with large evidence . Our observation is that this optimal noise scale persists empirically even though the true covariance matrix is anisotropic and non-stationary . We will discuss this connection in more depth when we update the manuscript . 5 ) Yes , if we kept aN/B constant then the test set accuracy would be constant and there would not be a generalization gap ( until the learning rate a is too large , as seen in figure 5a ) ; this is a key result of the paper and the meaning of the scaling rules . We will edit the text to make this clearer . The optimal batch size only arises when one holds the learning rate constant , equivalently there would be an optimal learning rate at constant batch size . We used SGD with momentum since it is more popular than conventional SGD in practice . The results without momentum are the same ( both optimal noise scale and the scaling rules ) . 6 ) The derivation in section 2 was first performed by Mackay in 1992 . We include it here because many researchers have not seen it , and because it is central to the remainder of the paper . In addition , we demonstrate the Bayesian evidence penalizes sharp minima but is invariant to model parameterization , resolving the objections of [ 2 ] . The derivation in section 5 is original . While our treatment is similar to [ 1 ] , they assume that the covariance matrix is stationary ; we show that this assumption is not necessary , since the covariance matrix cancels out when one equates the SGD to the SDE . 7 ) We apologize for this . We normalized the expected length of the training examples , not the features .

(2016) (Understanding deep learning requires rethinking generalization). Firstly, it shows experimentally that the same effects appear even for simple models such as linear regression. It also shows that the phenomenon that sharp minima lead to worse result can be explained by Bayesian evidence. Secondly, it views SGD with different settings as introducing different levels of noises that favors different minima. With both theoretical and experimental analysis, it suggests the optimal batch-size given learning rate and training data size. The paper is well written and provides excellent insights. Pros: 1. Very well written paper with good theoretical and experimental analysis. 2. It provides useful insights of model behaviors which are attractive to a large group of people in the community. 3. The result of optimal batch size setting is useful to wide range of learning methods. Cons and mainly questions: 1. Missing related work. One important contribution of the paper is about optimal batch sizes, but related work in this direction is not discussed. There are many related works concerning adaptive batch sizes, such as [1] (a summary in section 3.2 of [2]). 2. It will be great if the author could provide some discussions with respect to the analysis of information bottleneck [3] which also discuss the generalization ability of the model. 3. The result of the optimal mini-batch size depends on the training data size. How about real online learning with streaming data where the total number of data points are unknown? 4. The results are reported mostly concerning the training iterations, not the CPU time such as in figure 3. It will be fair/interesting to see the result for CPU time where small batch maybe favored more.

", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "reply_text": "We would like to respond to the comments from anonymous commenter ( s ) which followed your review . We feel that these comments are misleading and misrepresent the contributions of this work ; which we believe are significant . We have reviewed the previous papers suggested by the commenter ( s ) . Two are already cited in our paper [ 1,2 ] . One was released on arXiv after we submitted [ 3 ] . We are happy to cite [ 4 ] when we update the manuscript , which proposes merging SGD with control theory . The other suggested papers [ 5-7 ] are not relevant , since they discuss posterior sampling methods which use stochastic gradients , not the SGD . We emphasize that none of these papers predicted or observed an optimal batch size ( at constant learning rate ) . Additionally we are the first to derive the three scaling rules . Our treatment of the SGD is most similar to [ 2 ] , however their analysis only holds near local minima where the gradient covariance matrix between parameters is stationary . By contrast our derivation applies throughout training for both stationary and non-stationary covariance matrices . This is important since [ 8 ] found that the benefits of noise are most pronounced at the start of training . Furthermore , our results have important practical applications : i ) We show that tuning the batch size can lead to surprisingly large improvements in test accuracy . ii ) The scaling rules enable us to achieve large batch training without reducing the test set accuracy and without additional hyper-parameter tuning . iii ) They also predict how the batch size should be changed over time as more training data is collected ( the most common reason to retrain a model is that one has collected more training data ) . iv ) Finally , the scaling rules enable us to compare training runs performed on different hardware with different batch sizes/learning rates/momentum coefficients .
