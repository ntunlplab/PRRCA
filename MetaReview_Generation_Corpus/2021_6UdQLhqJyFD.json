Performance improvement over the baseline is consistent . Two aspects of the paper are disappointing , First , the motivation that the approach will enable end-to-end learning with transformer , should be re-written to say : `` This would enable end-to-end learning with multi-modal transformer for a handful of labs who have 64 V-100 GPUs which can be trained for 220K batches [ I 'm presuming that 's many days/weeks ] . '' It is quite impossible for almost all researchers to utilise the findings of this paper . It 's true that the number of parameters has dropped significantly , but in any forward/backward pass , the memory requirements of multiple slow-fast ( ResNet-50 ) with all transformers in memory and a necessarily large batch size keeps the same limitation of an `` end-to-end-to-end '' approach more likely to be used by the community .

Our work contributes to the video literature by reducing the model size . One important yet orthogonal direction is reducing the size of input data , e.g. , by adaptively selecting which frames to process ( e.g. , AdaFrame [ Wu et al. , CVPR 2019 ] ) or by learning directly from the compressed video format ( e.g. , CoViAR [ Wu et al. , CVPR 2018 ] ) .

Since both video processing and Transformer-based model are memory-intensive , a parameter-reducing scheme is proposed , which facililates training the model end-to-end . The AV representations are learned by training the network to solve two self-supervised pertaining tasks , and subsequently evaluated on various audio/visual downstream tasks . An ablation analysis is performed to demonstrate the efficacy of the various contributions . * * Strengths * * - Leveraging unlabeled videos to learn powerful audiovisual representations is an important problem , and judging by the many recent papers on this topic , of much relevance to the community . - The use of a Transformer-based model architecture is well-motivated , given its success on other multi-modal problems . To the best of my knowledge , videos of such long duration ( 30 sec . ) have not yet been used in this setting , and the ability to process such long videos seems doable due to the contributions of this paper . - The ablation study presented does a good job of highlighting the contribution of the design choices , and can be of importance to future works which seek to build upon this one . - Empirical results on both audio and video understanding tasks demonstrate that the proposed method does indeed learn useful representations , and that multimodal training provides the expected boost to results . * * Concerns * * - The authors imply that using a partially fixed model ( as has been done with multimodal vision/language tasks ) is inferior to end-to-end training , hence the motivation for the proposed parameter-reducing technique , which is the major technical contribution of this work , as presented by the authors . This may very well be the case , but I would have liked to see evidence of that . Obviously , comparing fixed vs. end-to-end training of vision/language models using the proposed method would be very interesting to see , but is out of the scope of this work . However , perhaps comparing the proposed end-to-end audiovisual model with a similar fixed model would provide the insight necessary to determine the importance of your contribution . - It seems to me that there are some previously reported self-supervised results missing from Table 2 : [ 1 ] obtain 93 % accuracy on UCF101 and 85.8 % on ESC using AudioSet for pretraining . [ 2 ] obtain 91.3 % on UCF101 , and [ 3 ] 93.8 % on UCF101 , both using larger datasets . This obviously a crowded space , with new results being published often , but I would have hoped to see larger performance gains on tasks that require more global reasoning , such as action recognition , given the ability of the proposed model to process very long sequences . - Perhaps I did n't understand this correctly , but in Table 1 , should n't CANS-dissimilar perform less well , since negative samples are `` easy '' , therefore causing MEP to dominate ? - Nit : In equation ( 1 ) , I think Q , K , and V might be missing the subscript ' i ' ? * * Additional comments * * - Abstract : The reader needs to read almost halfway through the abstract to get to what this work is about . IMO , either move a significantly reduced version of the `` why '' to after the `` what '' , or perhaps just leave the motivation for the introduction .

We particularly thank the reviewer for pointing out that our work is the first to learn from videos of long duration ( 30 sec ) in a self-supervised manner . This is indeed an important point to emphasize and poses great challenges that we address in this work . Based on the insightful comments , we have updated our paper with the following changes : * * * Partially fixed model baseline : * * We think this is a great suggestion ! We have added a new section in the Appendix ( B.6 ) showing the comparisons with those baselines for an extended discussion . * * * Tab 2 : * * We \u2019 d be happy to discuss XDC [ Alwassel et al. , 2020 ] who also report AudioSet-pretrained results . We have also added two other references [ 2,3 ] as they are closely relevant to our work ( though they used HowTo100M/YouTube-8M for pretraining ) . In general , we agree that video self-supervised learning is indeed a crowded space with new state-of-the-art results published often ; performance on standard benchmarks such as UCF101/ESC50 are getting somewhat saturated , which contain short duration clips ( 5 to 7 seconds ) . We hope that our work will encourage the community to go beyond short-clip understanding and start tackling long video understanding . * * * CANS-Dissimilar : * * We believe that this is primarily due to two factors : 1 ) We discard instances that fall outside the 95 % confidence interval , which helps remove `` `` too easy '' and ` `` too hard '' negatives ; those will be included in the two other baselines Current-Sequence and Current-MiniBatch ; 2 ) We perform stochastic sampling using the embedding distance as the sampling probability . With a batch size of 256 , there \u2019 s a good chance to include \u201c low-probability \u201d samples , e.g. , hard negatives for CANS-Dissimilar . * * * Eqn ( 1 ) : * * Thanks for spotting the missing subscript ( we believe the reviewer meant \u201c j \u201d ) .

It proposes ablations for which weights/layers to share across modalities , when/where to fuse/join both modalities , and other modeling details ( that matter ) . It also completes pre-training with 3 InfoNCE ( audio-audio , visual-visual , audio-visual ) with a binary classification loss about if two pairs of audio-visual are from the same or different videos . As strategies for negative sampling in audio and videos are different , it proposes to sample negatives that are similar in the ConvNets ' embeddings .

Contributions : + A sound , extensive set of ablations of the choices made along the way of modeling and training . + Good performance ( overall best reported but for UCF101 ) . Limitations : - The article is at times slightly difficult to follow . A few important pieces are mentioned too quickly : e.g.how exactly to do the content-aware negative sampling ( bottom paragraph page 4 ) , or how exactly to get U\u03a3V from ( maintain \u03a3 orthogonal with a scale-squaring trick + first project Vx on the unit sphere ) . Some explanations come after the first introduction of the term . - There is a small flaw in the parameters sharing experiments ( Table 1 , bottom ) as the models that are compared have vastly different capacity , so maybe not the same training regimes . It would be more rigorous to also have an experiment where one reduces the ( parameters ) size of the model without sharing from 155M to ~34M ( or 31M , and decompose W=U\u03a3V for those weights too ) , and compare this to the all/part parameter shared models . - Not a negative point in itself , but related to how this article is written : content-aware negative sampling is not new , see e.g.FaceNet ( Schroff et al.2015 ) , On Mutual Information in Contrastive Learning for Visual Representations ( Wu et al.2020 ) .Overall , the paper presents multiple ablations and gives results that show that the model leverages both modalities , on challenging datasets .

Our work contributes to the video literature by reducing the model size . One important yet orthogonal direction is reducing the size of input data , e.g. , by adaptively selecting which frames to process ( e.g. , AdaFrame [ Wu et al. , CVPR 2019 ] ) or by learning directly from the compressed video format ( e.g. , CoViAR [ Wu et al. , CVPR 2018 ] ) .

Since both video processing and Transformer-based model are memory-intensive , a parameter-reducing scheme is proposed , which facililates training the model end-to-end . The AV representations are learned by training the network to solve two self-supervised pertaining tasks , and subsequently evaluated on various audio/visual downstream tasks . An ablation analysis is performed to demonstrate the efficacy of the various contributions . * * Strengths * * - Leveraging unlabeled videos to learn powerful audiovisual representations is an important problem , and judging by the many recent papers on this topic , of much relevance to the community . - The use of a Transformer-based model architecture is well-motivated , given its success on other multi-modal problems . To the best of my knowledge , videos of such long duration ( 30 sec . ) have not yet been used in this setting , and the ability to process such long videos seems doable due to the contributions of this paper . - The ablation study presented does a good job of highlighting the contribution of the design choices , and can be of importance to future works which seek to build upon this one . - Empirical results on both audio and video understanding tasks demonstrate that the proposed method does indeed learn useful representations , and that multimodal training provides the expected boost to results . * * Concerns * * - The authors imply that using a partially fixed model ( as has been done with multimodal vision/language tasks ) is inferior to end-to-end training , hence the motivation for the proposed parameter-reducing technique , which is the major technical contribution of this work , as presented by the authors . This may very well be the case , but I would have liked to see evidence of that . Obviously , comparing fixed vs. end-to-end training of vision/language models using the proposed method would be very interesting to see , but is out of the scope of this work . However , perhaps comparing the proposed end-to-end audiovisual model with a similar fixed model would provide the insight necessary to determine the importance of your contribution . - It seems to me that there are some previously reported self-supervised results missing from Table 2 : [ 1 ] obtain 93 % accuracy on UCF101 and 85.8 % on ESC using AudioSet for pretraining . [ 2 ] obtain 91.3 % on UCF101 , and [ 3 ] 93.8 % on UCF101 , both using larger datasets . This obviously a crowded space , with new results being published often , but I would have hoped to see larger performance gains on tasks that require more global reasoning , such as action recognition , given the ability of the proposed model to process very long sequences . - Perhaps I did n't understand this correctly , but in Table 1 , should n't CANS-dissimilar perform less well , since negative samples are `` easy '' , therefore causing MEP to dominate ? - Nit : In equation ( 1 ) , I think Q , K , and V might be missing the subscript ' i ' ? * * Additional comments * * - Abstract : The reader needs to read almost halfway through the abstract to get to what this work is about . IMO , either move a significantly reduced version of the `` why '' to after the `` what '' , or perhaps just leave the motivation for the introduction .

We particularly thank the reviewer for pointing out that our work is the first to learn from videos of long duration ( 30 sec ) in a self-supervised manner . This is indeed an important point to emphasize and poses great challenges that we address in this work . Based on the insightful comments , we have updated our paper with the following changes : * * * Partially fixed model baseline : * * We think this is a great suggestion ! We have added a new section in the Appendix ( B.6 ) showing the comparisons with those baselines for an extended discussion . * * * Tab 2 : * * We \u2019 d be happy to discuss XDC [ Alwassel et al. , 2020 ] who also report AudioSet-pretrained results . We have also added two other references [ 2,3 ] as they are closely relevant to our work ( though they used HowTo100M/YouTube-8M for pretraining ) . In general , we agree that video self-supervised learning is indeed a crowded space with new state-of-the-art results published often ; performance on standard benchmarks such as UCF101/ESC50 are getting somewhat saturated , which contain short duration clips ( 5 to 7 seconds ) . We hope that our work will encourage the community to go beyond short-clip understanding and start tackling long video understanding . * * * CANS-Dissimilar : * * We believe that this is primarily due to two factors : 1 ) We discard instances that fall outside the 95 % confidence interval , which helps remove `` `` too easy '' and ` `` too hard '' negatives ; those will be included in the two other baselines Current-Sequence and Current-MiniBatch ; 2 ) We perform stochastic sampling using the embedding distance as the sampling probability . With a batch size of 256 , there \u2019 s a good chance to include \u201c low-probability \u201d samples , e.g. , hard negatives for CANS-Dissimilar . * * * Eqn ( 1 ) : * * Thanks for spotting the missing subscript ( we believe the reviewer meant \u201c j \u201d ) . We have fixed it . * * * Abstract : * * This is a great suggestion . We have shortened the \u201c why \u201d and extended the \u201c what \u201d ."}, "3": {"review_id": "6UdQLhqJyFD-3", "review_text": "This paper studies modeling and training choices when designing a single model based on ConvNets and transformers for audio-visual representation learning . It proposes ablations for which weights/layers to share across modalities , when/where to fuse/join both modalities , and other modeling details ( that matter ) . It also completes pre-training with 3 InfoNCE ( audio-audio , visual-visual , audio-visual ) with a binary classification loss about if two pairs of audio-visual are from the same or different videos . As strategies for negative sampling in audio and videos are different , it proposes to sample negatives that are similar in the ConvNets ' embeddings . The models are pretrained on Kinetics-700 and AudioSet and evaluated on UCF101 , ESC-50 , and Kinectics-Sounds . Contributions : + A sound , extensive set of ablations of the choices made along the way of modeling and training . + Good performance ( overall best reported but for UCF101 ) . Limitations : - The article is at times slightly difficult to follow . A few important pieces are mentioned too quickly : e.g.how exactly to do the content-aware negative sampling ( bottom paragraph page 4 ) , or how exactly to get U\u03a3V from ( maintain \u03a3 orthogonal with a scale-squaring trick + first project Vx on the unit sphere ) . Some explanations come after the first introduction of the term . - There is a small flaw in the parameters sharing experiments ( Table 1 , bottom ) as the models that are compared have vastly different capacity , so maybe not the same training regimes . It would be more rigorous to also have an experiment where one reduces the ( parameters ) size of the model without sharing from 155M to ~34M ( or 31M , and decompose W=U\u03a3V for those weights too ) , and compare this to the all/part parameter shared models . - Not a negative point in itself , but related to how this article is written : content-aware negative sampling is not new , see e.g.FaceNet ( Schroff et al.2015 ) , On Mutual Information in Contrastive Learning for Visual Representations ( Wu et al.2020 ) .Overall , the paper presents multiple ablations and gives results that show that the model leverages both modalities , on challenging datasets . But it feels a bit too much like a tech report , where the most important bits of the contribution are given a too light algorithmic treatment ( negative sampling , parameter sharing ) .
