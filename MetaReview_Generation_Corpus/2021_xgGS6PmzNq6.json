We have polished the description for dyadic fairness in Section 3 to present a straightforward understanding for readers . The motivation of this paper comes from the potential bias in user recommendation in social networks and recommendation systems . In social networks , users with the same gender or religion are more likely to connect with others . A data-driven model may capture the correlations between user connections and their sensitive attribute , and continue to recommend users with the same sensitive attributes , thus leading to segregation in gender or religion . We propose our model to alleviate this kind of bias . First , we formulate what is the fairness in link prediction in a homogeneous graph with the help from demographic parity [ 1,2,3,4,5 ] . Demographic parity , a well-used fairness notion in classification problems , says given two sensitive groups ( e.g. , male/female ) , it encourages the classifier to give positive outcomes to the two groups at the same rate . In our problem , we treat the intra link and inter link as two sensitive groups ( male-male and female-female/male-female ) , and also ask to equalize the outcomes of these two types of links . Having such a fairness notion , ideally , from a collection of potential links , we are able to see intra links and inter links at the same rate , which break segregation by encouraging more connections across sensitive groups ( more connections between males and females ) . This is the problem formulation and why we need to have dyadic fairness to unbias the link predictions .

Clarity : I believe the presentation can be improved . Specifically , the problem setting can be better explained in the introduction , where terms like `` dyadic fairness '' or `` homogeneous graph '' are thrown without much details . Perhaps a practical example can help understanding the problem under analysis . Significance : Link prediction is an important problem in the analysis of social/citation networks , thus , the topic of the work is relevant to the community . In addition , the problem is analyzed under fairness considerations which increases the significance . The results , however , are not strong in my opinion ( at least from my first review of the paper ) . Questions : My next questions might come from misunderstandings , in which case I would like to clarify : * Why is homogeneous graph said to be the focus of the analysis in the introduction but , later on , it is not even mentioned in the technical results . Was that assumption being used ? did it matter at all ? * Authors state that the goal is to have link predictions that are independent of the sensitive attributes . Why does minimizing the norm of the difference of averages of node vectors of each group imply predictions being independent of the sensitive attribute ? Not having a good explanation for this would undermine the work a lot . * The references in Section 2 seem rather arbitrary , for instance , in `` fair machine learning '' I do not see the work `` learning fair representations '' ( Zemel et al.2013 ) .I wonder why it was not referred or rather why are the listed references there preferred over other works ?", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Thanks for reviewing our paper . * * 1.Homogeneous graph * * A homogeneous graph contains vertices with the same type . For instance , vertices in a homogeneous social network present users . Since fairness in link prediction is a newly emerged topic , for the analysis and the method we focus on homogeneous graphs in this paper for simplicity . All datasets we use for experiments are homogeneous graphs . It would be interesting to extend our work to the heterogeneous graph . However , there might be additional work on problem formulation on the extension to heterogeneous graph , since different types of vertices have different types of sensitive attributes . For example , in heterogeneous social networks , there are two types of vertices , user and tweet . Gender can be selected as the sensitive attributes for users , while political opinion propensity can present the sensitive attributes for tweets . We can have the fairness if we want different genders to receive equal opinions from political opinions . * * 2.From dyadic fairness to Proposition 4.1 * * We have refined Section 3 to present a more clear formulation of dyadic fairness . We get the notion demographic parity [ 1,2,3,4,5 ] , a well-used fairness notion in classification , to help us formulate dyadic fairness in the link prediction problem . In classification problems , demographic parity says given two sensitive groups ( e.g. , male/female ) , we want the classifier to give positive outcomes to the two groups at the same rate ( e.g.no gender discrimination in loan applications ) . In our problem , we treat intra link ( male-male/female-female ) and inter link ( male-female ) as two sensitive groups in the content of demographic parity , and also ask to equalize the outcome of these two types of links . Having such a fairness notion , ideally , from a collection of potential links , we can get intra links and inter links at the same rate , which can break segregation by encouraging more connections across sensitive groups ( more connections between males and females ) . By measuring the absolute difference between the predictive scores on intra and inter links ( right side in proposition 4.1 ) , and based on proposition 4.1 , we are safe to reduce the achievement of dyadic fairness to the minimization of the norm gap between groups .

We establish dyadic fairness from demographic parity , a well-used fairness notion in a series of literature [ 1,2,3,4,5 ] . In the classification problem , demographic parity says given two sensitive groups ( e.g. , male/female ) , we want the classifier to give positive outcomes to the two groups at the same rate ( e.g.bank loan access with no gender discrimination ) . In our problem , we treat the intra links ( e.g. , male-male/female-female ) and inter links ( e.g. , male-female ) as two sensitive groups in demographic parity formulation , and also ask to equalize the predictive scores over these two groups , therefore run into the definition 3.1 of dyadic fairness in our updated paper . Ideally , from a bag of potential links , we can get intra and inter links at the same rate by achieving dyadic fairness , hence break segregation by encouraging more connections across sensitive groups ( e.g. , groups of male and female ) . In [ 6 ] they formulate demographic parity at all types of links , while we only consider intra and inter links in our work .

It would be interesting to extend our work to the heterogeneous graphs . However , there might be additional work on problem formulation on the extension , since different types of vertices will come to have different types of sensitive attributes . A potential case in heterogeneous social networks is , there are two types of vertices , user and tweet . Gender can be selected as the sensitive attributes for users , while political opinion propensity can present the sensitive attributes for tweets . We may want different genders are receiving equal political opinions . We provide an extended theoretical form of two-layer GNNs in our updated appendix since two-layer in GNNs are most widely used . * * 3.Time efficiency analysis * * In our method , the step for adjusting the adjacency matrix is O ( NDlogD ) where N is the number of vertices and D is the average degree of vertices in the graph . The rest of our method ( step for optimizing GNNs ) is linear to the size of model parameters and is the same in a typical adversarial approach . ___ * * 4.Extension for theoretical findings * * We provide a theoretical form of two-layer GNNs in our updated appendix , for GNNs with two-layer are widely used and have the most practical value . A two-layer GNNs can be viewed as two-hop since it receives the message from second-hop neighbors . Our analysis is feasible for any homogeneous bipartite graph since we do not put any assumptions on the graph connections in the theoretical part . If in a user-item setting , we need to handle the types of sensitive attributes as discussed in * * 2 * * . Corollary 4.1 implies the algebraical relationship between the upper bound of transformed dyadic fairness after passing a real GNN layer and the model parameters . Both Corollaries on 1-layer GNN and 2-layer GNN have upper bounds composed of two parts : one is the linear mapping of original dyadic fairness , $ |\\mu_0-\\mu_1| $ , and another one is additional errors $ \\sigma $ from maximal deviations within groups . If the error term is relatively ignorable to $ |\\mu_0-\\mu_1| $ , a contractive upper bound could approximately be achieved with L and spectral norm on $ W_\\theta $ less than one .

They evaluate this algorithm on several real-world datasets . The experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm increases fairness as measured by demographic parity at the expense of accuracy . This paper is quite dense and difficult to read . There is little exposition to provide the intuition for what the authors are doing , especially for the reader who is unfamiliar with the particular techniques used . The motivation is also not completely clear to me -- while there are definitely instances where people are interested in demographic parity as a constraint , I do n't necessarily see how link prediction in particular is one of those instances . From a technical perspective , the work appears to be novel and sound . The experiments show that the proposed algorithm achieves what it sets out to do , in comparison with baselines .", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Thanks for your comments . We have polished the description for dyadic fairness in Section 3 to present a straightforward understanding for readers . The motivation of this paper comes from the potential bias in user recommendation in social networks and recommendation systems . In social networks , users with the same gender or religion are more likely to connect with others . A data-driven model may capture the correlations between user connections and their sensitive attribute , and continue to recommend users with the same sensitive attributes , thus leading to segregation in gender or religion . We propose our model to alleviate this kind of bias . First , we formulate what is the fairness in link prediction in a homogeneous graph with the help from demographic parity [ 1,2,3,4,5 ] . Demographic parity , a well-used fairness notion in classification problems , says given two sensitive groups ( e.g. , male/female ) , it encourages the classifier to give positive outcomes to the two groups at the same rate . In our problem , we treat the intra link and inter link as two sensitive groups ( male-male and female-female/male-female ) , and also ask to equalize the outcomes of these two types of links . Having such a fairness notion , ideally , from a collection of potential links , we are able to see intra links and inter links at the same rate , which break segregation by encouraging more connections across sensitive groups ( more connections between males and females ) . This is the problem formulation and why we need to have dyadic fairness to unbias the link predictions .

Clarity : I believe the presentation can be improved . Specifically , the problem setting can be better explained in the introduction , where terms like `` dyadic fairness '' or `` homogeneous graph '' are thrown without much details . Perhaps a practical example can help understanding the problem under analysis . Significance : Link prediction is an important problem in the analysis of social/citation networks , thus , the topic of the work is relevant to the community . In addition , the problem is analyzed under fairness considerations which increases the significance . The results , however , are not strong in my opinion ( at least from my first review of the paper ) . Questions : My next questions might come from misunderstandings , in which case I would like to clarify : * Why is homogeneous graph said to be the focus of the analysis in the introduction but , later on , it is not even mentioned in the technical results . Was that assumption being used ? did it matter at all ? * Authors state that the goal is to have link predictions that are independent of the sensitive attributes . Why does minimizing the norm of the difference of averages of node vectors of each group imply predictions being independent of the sensitive attribute ? Not having a good explanation for this would undermine the work a lot . * The references in Section 2 seem rather arbitrary , for instance , in `` fair machine learning '' I do not see the work `` learning fair representations '' ( Zemel et al.2013 ) .I wonder why it was not referred or rather why are the listed references there preferred over other works ?", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Thanks for reviewing our paper . * * 1.Homogeneous graph * * A homogeneous graph contains vertices with the same type . For instance , vertices in a homogeneous social network present users . Since fairness in link prediction is a newly emerged topic , for the analysis and the method we focus on homogeneous graphs in this paper for simplicity . All datasets we use for experiments are homogeneous graphs . It would be interesting to extend our work to the heterogeneous graph . However , there might be additional work on problem formulation on the extension to heterogeneous graph , since different types of vertices have different types of sensitive attributes . For example , in heterogeneous social networks , there are two types of vertices , user and tweet . Gender can be selected as the sensitive attributes for users , while political opinion propensity can present the sensitive attributes for tweets . We can have the fairness if we want different genders to receive equal opinions from political opinions . * * 2.From dyadic fairness to Proposition 4.1 * * We have refined Section 3 to present a more clear formulation of dyadic fairness . We get the notion demographic parity [ 1,2,3,4,5 ] , a well-used fairness notion in classification , to help us formulate dyadic fairness in the link prediction problem . In classification problems , demographic parity says given two sensitive groups ( e.g. , male/female ) , we want the classifier to give positive outcomes to the two groups at the same rate ( e.g.no gender discrimination in loan applications ) . In our problem , we treat intra link ( male-male/female-female ) and inter link ( male-female ) as two sensitive groups in the content of demographic parity , and also ask to equalize the outcome of these two types of links . Having such a fairness notion , ideally , from a collection of potential links , we can get intra links and inter links at the same rate , which can break segregation by encouraging more connections across sensitive groups ( more connections between males and females ) . By measuring the absolute difference between the predictive scores on intra and inter links ( right side in proposition 4.1 ) , and based on proposition 4.1 , we are safe to reduce the achievement of dyadic fairness to the minimization of the norm gap between groups .

Might be helpful to highlight the formal definition of this and the corresponding insights . - Current analysis and method are conducted at homogeneous graph and the analysis is concluded on 1-layer GNN scenario , would be better to open discussions for future work - One missing part of the proposed mitigation strategy is around the time efficiency analysis .

We establish dyadic fairness from demographic parity , a well-used fairness notion in a series of literature [ 1,2,3,4,5 ] . In the classification problem , demographic parity says given two sensitive groups ( e.g. , male/female ) , we want the classifier to give positive outcomes to the two groups at the same rate ( e.g.bank loan access with no gender discrimination ) . In our problem , we treat the intra links ( e.g. , male-male/female-female ) and inter links ( e.g. , male-female ) as two sensitive groups in demographic parity formulation , and also ask to equalize the predictive scores over these two groups , therefore run into the definition 3.1 of dyadic fairness in our updated paper . Ideally , from a bag of potential links , we can get intra and inter links at the same rate by achieving dyadic fairness , hence break segregation by encouraging more connections across sensitive groups ( e.g. , groups of male and female ) . In [ 6 ] they formulate demographic parity at all types of links , while we only consider intra and inter links in our work .

It would be interesting to extend our work to the heterogeneous graphs . However , there might be additional work on problem formulation on the extension , since different types of vertices will come to have different types of sensitive attributes . A potential case in heterogeneous social networks is , there are two types of vertices , user and tweet . Gender can be selected as the sensitive attributes for users , while political opinion propensity can present the sensitive attributes for tweets . We may want different genders are receiving equal political opinions . We provide an extended theoretical form of two-layer GNNs in our updated appendix since two-layer in GNNs are most widely used . * * 3.Time efficiency analysis * * In our method , the step for adjusting the adjacency matrix is O ( NDlogD ) where N is the number of vertices and D is the average degree of vertices in the graph . The rest of our method ( step for optimizing GNNs ) is linear to the size of model parameters and is the same in a typical adversarial approach . ___ * * 4.Extension for theoretical findings * * We provide a theoretical form of two-layer GNNs in our updated appendix , for GNNs with two-layer are widely used and have the most practical value . A two-layer GNNs can be viewed as two-hop since it receives the message from second-hop neighbors . Our analysis is feasible for any homogeneous bipartite graph since we do not put any assumptions on the graph connections in the theoretical part . If in a user-item setting , we need to handle the types of sensitive attributes as discussed in * * 2 * * . Corollary 4.1 implies the algebraical relationship between the upper bound of transformed dyadic fairness after passing a real GNN layer and the model parameters . Both Corollaries on 1-layer GNN and 2-layer GNN have upper bounds composed of two parts : one is the linear mapping of original dyadic fairness , $ |\\mu_0-\\mu_1| $ , and another one is additional errors $ \\sigma $ from maximal deviations within groups . If the error term is relatively ignorable to $ |\\mu_0-\\mu_1| $ , a contractive upper bound could approximately be achieved with L and spectral norm on $ W_\\theta $ less than one .
