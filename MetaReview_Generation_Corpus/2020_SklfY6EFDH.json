Summary === This paper proposes to evaluate the representation (here, the output of 9 probabilities for 9 classes at the last softmax output layer) of an image taken from an unseen category by two metrics: - The first metric (DBI) essentially measures how compact the learned manifold is (i.e. how nearby are the softmax probability vectors of images from an unseen category). - The second metric basically measures how close a 9-D probability output vector (\"soft labels\" in the paper) of a classifier trained on the 9 classes is to a \"ground-truth\" which is the same 9-D vector but obtained when the classifier is trained on the full 10 CIFAR-10 classes. The authors computed these \"representation measures\" for a set of 7 networks (6 convnets + CapsuleNet) trained on CIFAR-10. Then, a set of white-box adversarial attacks were performed on these 7 networks and the results (both how accurate the classifier is, and the amount of L2 perturbations required to change a label) were used as a \"robustness measures\". The authors then claim that the ranking of the 7 classifiers based on the representation measures match the rankings derived from the robustness measures. The paper attempts to find the correlation between the representation quality of a classifier with its adversarial robustness. This general direction is important and worth pursuing!

To this end, they propose the zero-shot test to investigate the \"quality\" of learned representations for unknown classes. Specifically, they leverage two kinds of quality metrics on data of unknown classes. The first one is based on clustering named Davies-Bouldin Index which measures the compactness of intra-cluster. The second one is based on the difference of soft-label histogram distributions with/without unknown classes during training, which may describe the generalization for unknown classes or bias towards known classes of learned features. Finally, with these two metrics, they rank the quality of different models and compare such ranking results with the attack robustness obtained by different attack techniques on CIFAR-10 dataset. +Strengths: 1.

The idea of representations quality on unknown classes determining attack robustness is not reasonable. Since the adversarial attack is defined on the known classes, the reasons for that are in two aspects. The first is the training dataset. If the collected training data cannot represent/fulfil the whole continuous distribution/manifold of the categories or even biased, the models are of course easily fooled by unseen modes during test. The second is the mapping for classification is from high to low, which is naturally many to one. In a word, I think the quality of models on unknown classes is not directly related to the problem of adversarial attack. 3. This paper only conducts experiments on CIFAR-10 dataset, which is not convincing enough. It would be better to evaluate their method on more challenging benchmarks and also give more validation about their idea. E.g. on ImageNet, if enough number of categories has been seen for models, whether they would become more robust to adversarial attack. Evaluating features of more layers rather than the softmax outputs is also needed. 4. What is amalgam proportion? Please explain it in detail or give a reference paper.

The idea of representations quality on unknown classes determining attack robustness is not reasonable. Since the adversarial attack is defined on the known classes, the reasons for that are in two aspects. The first is the training dataset. If the collected training data cannot represent/fulfil the whole continuous distribution/manifold of the categories or even biased, the models are of course easily fooled by unseen modes during test. The second is the mapping for classification is from high to low, which is naturally many to one. In a word, I think the quality of models on unknown classes is not directly related to the problem of adversarial attack. 3. This paper only conducts experiments on CIFAR-10 dataset, which is not convincing enough. It would be better to evaluate their method on more challenging benchmarks and also give more validation about their idea. E.g. on ImageNet, if enough number of categories has been seen for models, whether they would become more robust to adversarial attack. Evaluating features of more layers rather than the softmax outputs is also needed. 4. What is amalgam proportion? Please explain it in detail or give a reference paper. Otherwise the readers cannot understand the motivation of the second metric in Sec3.2. Besides, Fig.2 contains little information and few captions for readers to understand their method. 5. In Tab.1 and 2, the meanings of Attack Accuracy and Average Amount of Perturbations (typo in caption for Tab.2) are not introduced. Tab.5 shows 7 methods but its caption says \u201cfive\u201d. Fig.4 is also confused, for AM, which histogram is with unknown classes and which one is without? 6. The title says \"representation quality explain adversarial attacks\".

The second is the mapping for classification is from high to low , which is naturally many to one . In a word , I think the quality of models on unknown classes is not directly related to the problem of adversarial attack . We do not conduct attacks on unknown classes but evaluate the quality of representation on unknown classes . By representation we mean high level features . Therefore , we want to avoid any mapping of input to output and rather investigate to what extent features are still working for different patterns with similar features . The presentation of the paper was not clear enough . To improve the presentation further , Section 2 was added . This section explains the mathematical motivation behind the metrics as well as the motivation behind going beyond losses to evaluate robustness on models . > 3.This paper only conducts experiments on CIFAR-10 dataset , which is not convincing enough .

Evaluating features of more layers rather than the softmax outputs is also needed . Indeed , further tests on ImageNet would be able to tell if representation improves .

Besides , Fig.2 contains little information and few captions for readers to understand their method . Figure 2 was further enhanced with more details to facilitate the understanding of the Amalgam metric . Amalgam metric is the difference between the N-1 soft-labels ( i.e. , excluding the true class label ) for a classifier that knows the class and for a classifier that does not know the class . The classifier that knows the class acts as a ground-truth . > 5.In Tab.1 and 2 , the meanings of Attack Accuracy and Average Amount of Perturbations ( typo in caption for Tab.2 ) are not introduced .

The experiments show that the link holds and now there is a person correlation further evidencing it ."}, "2": {"review_id": "SklfY6EFDH-2", "review_text": "This paper proposes to evaluate the robustness of the neural networks by extrapolating to the unseen classes. However, the authors only include evaluation for non-robust trained models, without considering the robust trained model, such as Madry et al. [1]. The conclusion is not convincing that the authors studied the robustness using only non-robust models, because it is well known that the accuracy for attacking non-robust model can be 100% (for CIFAR-10). It is useful if the authors study whether their method can be used to measure the robustness of the robust trained models. 1. The paper only evaluate robust accuracy on models without robust training. 2. The evidence in the paper does not support their point. The paper shows that there's link between adversarial robustness and the generalization ability of neural network to extrapolate to unseen classes. But could not support the claim in the abstract, that \"The main idea lies in the fact that some features are present on unknown classes and that unknown classes can be defined as a combination of previous learned features without representation bias (a bias towards representation that maps only current set of input-outputs and their boundary)\" The extrapolation score does not prove this. 3. The attack accuracy in Table 1 is not convincing. In [1], the PGD for epsilon=0.3 is 100% for non-robust models and around 55% for robust models, the number in the Table matches non of these. 4. The writing of this paper is not clear and has gramma issues. For example, Table 1 and 2 miss information in Caption. 5. The author should cite \"Adversarial Examples Are a Natural Consequence of Test Error in Noise\", which also studied the generalization and adversarial robustness. 6.

Adversarial training is specific for robustness against particular attacks and not attacks in general . For example , in Vargas and Kotyan ( 2019 ) the authors showed that L\\infty based adversarial training fail to protect against L0 attacks . Therefore , adding an experiment on the adversarial training would lead to more confusion among the readers as different types of adversarial training exist and for each type a different vulnerability will be found .

After reading your comment , we re-read the Madry et.al . ( 2017 ) for the PGD attacks , however there is a slight misinterpretation of the epsilon for the original paper and our reproduction . Kindly allow us to explain this misinterpretation . In the original paper , Madry et.al used epsilon=0.3 for the MNIST dataset while epsilon=8 was used for the CIFAR-10 dataset . Also , for the reasoning why we used a different parameter than the original paper is too keep all adversarial attacks comparable to each other . As epsilon is directly related to the degree of freedom an adversarial attack has for the perturbations . We kept the epsilon value as close as possible for all the different attacks we experimented with . Madry , A. , Makelov , A. , Schmidt , L. , Tsipras , D. , & Vladu , A .
