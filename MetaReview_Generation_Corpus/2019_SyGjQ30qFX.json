Of these, the first two were the main concerns. In particular, R1 and R2 raised concerns about insufficient component-wise evaluation (e.g., text classification from topic models) and insufficient GAN-based baselines. Also, the topic model part of TopicGAN seems somewhat underdeveloped in that the model assumes a single topic per document, which is a relatively strong simplifying assumption compared to most other topic models (R1, R3). The technical novelty is not extremely strong in that the proposed model combines existing components together. But this alone would have not been a deal breaker if the empirical results were rigorous and strong.\n\nVerdict:\nReject. Many technical details require clarification and experiments lack sufficient comparisons against prior art.", "reviews": [{"review_id": "SyGjQ30qFX-0", "review_text": "This paper proposes TopicGAN, a generative adversarial approach to topic modeling and text generation. The model basically combines two steps: first to generate words (bag-of-words) for a topic, then second to generate the sequence of the words. While the idea is interesting, there are several important limitations. First, the paper is difficult to understand, and some of the explanations are not convincing. For example, in section 4.1.1, it says \"... our method assumes that the documents are produced from a single topic ... Our assumption aligns well with human intuition that most documents are generated from a single main topic.\" This goes very much against the common assumption of a generative topic model, such as LDA, which the model compares against. I don't mean to argue either way, but if the paper presents a viewpoint which is quite different from the commonly accepted viewpoint (within the specific research field), then there needs to be a much deeper explanation, ideally with concrete evidence to support it. Another sentence from the same paragraph states that their \"model outperforms LDA because LDA is a statistical model, while our generator is a deep generative model.\" This argument also seems flawed and without concrete evidence. There are other parts in the paper where the logic seems strange and without evidence, and they make it difficult to understand and accept the major claims of the paper. Second, the model does not offer much novelty. It seems that the two-stage model simply puts the two pieces, a GAN-style generator and an LSTM sequence model together. Perhaps I am not understanding the model, but the model description was also not clear nor easy to understand with respect to its novelty. Third, the evaluation is somewhat weak. There are two main evaluations tasks: text classification and text generation. For the first task, classification is not the main purpose of topic models, and while text classification _is_ used in many topic modeling papers, it is almost always accompanied by other evaluation metrics such as held-out perplexity and topic coherence. This is because the main purpose of topic modeling is to actually infer the topics (per-topic word distribution and per-document topic distribution) and model the corpus. Thus I feel it is not a fair evaluation to just compare the models using text classification tasks. The second evaluation task of text generation is not explained enough. For the human evaluation, who were the annotators, and how were they trained? How many people annotated each output, and what was the inter-rater agreement? How many sentences were evaluated, and how were they chosen? Without these details, it is difficult to judge whether this evaluation was valid. Lastly, the results are mediocre. Besides the classification task, the others do not show significant improvements over the baseline models. Perplexity (table 3) shows similar results for DBPedia and worse results (than WGAN-gp) for Gigaword. Table 4 shows slightly better results for \"Preference\" for TopicGAN with joint training, but \"Accuracy\" is measured only for the proposed model and not the baseline model.

Specifically, the paper adopts the framework of InfoGAN to generates the bag-of-words of a document and the latent codes in InfoGAN correspond to the latent topics in topic modelling. In addition to the above framework, to make the model work better, several add-ons are also proposed, combining autoencoder, loss clipping, and a generative model to generate text sequences based on the bag-of-words. My comments are as follows: 1. There are several issues of this paper on clarity: (1) The first major one for me is that the authors did not give any details on how to interpret the latent code (i.e. the topics here) with the top words. In conventional topic models, usually a topic is a distribution of words, so that top words can be selected by their weights. But I did not see something similar in the proposed model. (2) Another major one is why the word sequence generator is introduced in the proposed model. I did not see the contribution of this part to the whole model as a topic model, although the joint training shows the marginal performance gain on text generation. (3) Some of the experiment settings are not provided, for example, the number of topics, the value of \\alpha and \\lambda in the proposed model, the hyperparameters of LDA, which are crucial for the results. (4) Why is the size of the bag-of-words vocabulary set to be 3K whereas that of the word generation vocabulary set to be 15K? Minor issues: (5) In the related work of InfoGAN, there are a lot of cross-references to the following sections, before they are properly introduced. (6) Typo of \"Accurcay\" in Table 4(a). 2. Using adversarial training for topic models seems to be an interesting idea. There is not much work in this line and this paper proposes a model that seems to be working. But it seems to be that the proposed model has several issues as follows: (1) Each document seems to have only one topic, which can be an impractical setting for long documents. (2) The proposed model ignores the word counts, which can be important for topic modelling. (3) I did not see a major improvement of the proposed model over others, given that the only numerical result reported is classification accuracy and the state-of-the-art conventional topic models are not compared. This also leads to my concern about the experiments. I would expect more comparisons than classification accuracy, such as topic coherence and perplexity (for topic modelling) and with more advanced conventional models. From the low values of the accuracy on 20NG, I am wondering if LDA is working properly. ", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "Writing : We have rewritten many parts of the article to make the paper easier to understand . In addition , some not convincing explanations mentioned in the review are also revised . ( 1 ) How to select topic words : Our topic classification model is a V * K matrix M , where V is the word number and K is the number of latent topics . For each column of M is a topic distribution of words which is similar to conventional topic models such as LDA . The value of M [ i ] [ j ] represents the importance of i-th word to j-th topic . Therefore , we were able to select the top few words with highest weight within each topic as topic words . We have included those details in the revised version ( Section4.2 ) . ( 2 ) Why word sequence generator is included in the paper : The goal of our work not only aims to train a high quality topic model , but also aims to generate high quality text using GAN by two steps generation . Using GAN for language generating is notorious for extremely difficult to train because it needs to ( 1 ) generate meaningful context with ( 2 ) correct grammar simultaneously . However , in our work , we try to separate this two core part of language generation and make the generation process easier . ( 3 ) Some detail : For all experiments ( including baseline models ) , we set the topic number same as the class number . For example , in 20 News Groups , the class number is 20 , and thus we set the topic number to 20 . We use online LDA with different hyperparameters adjusted to get the better result on each dataset . ( 4 ) Why BOW vocabulary size is smaller : The size of the bag-of-words vocabulary is smaller because we hope during bag-of-words generation our model can focus on more important and general words . With smaller vocabulary size of bag-of-words , the result of unsupervised learning is better . ( 5 ) Cross-references : We have rewritten some methodology part and make it clearer . ( 6 ) Typo : We have revised this typo . Part2 : ( 1 ) Assuming documents are generated from one single main topic : In our experiments , we conduct unsupervised document classification , in which the documents have only one single class .

In addition , as the length of our training documents is short , it \u2019 s hard to break the short text into several topics , which is one of the possible reason that makes LDA works not well on short text .

( 3 ) Topic coherence score is reported : We have evaluated the topic coherence score and reported the score on revised paper Table 3 .
