They demonstrate that the method can indeed find minimal RNNs that, when trained even on small corpus dataset of formal languages can generalize beyond the training data.\n\nMost reviewers and myself agree that this work is really interesting, and also refreshing to see a new approach compared to the typical way of doing things. However, as we can see in the reviews, the work is not at the level of an ICLR conference submission at this point. R1, R3, and R4's reviews breaks down the points of the papers into strengths and weaknesses, and I am inclined to believe that if the authors spend more time to try to address the weakness and improve the work, this can be a great paper in the future. Although R3 gave a score of clear reject (which is too low IMO), and the authors responded to their points, I'm inclined to believe that this work warrants another revision.\n\nSpecifically, reviewers (and myself) believe that the baseline methods can indeed perform better than reported. And while, for a novel method, we don't expect the approach to scale to SOTA approaches for sequence modeling, it would improve the work vastly if there is evidence to show that it can scale to larger tasks, and give an impression that there can be a roadmap of attacking larger problems that standard methods can currently handle.\n\nCurrently, I would say the work is a great workshop paper, but would encourage the authors to continue to consider the feedback given here to work on a future revision.", "reviews": [{"review_id": "2Ey_1FeNtOC-0", "review_text": "This paper presents an approach to training recurrent neural networks with the mix objective of minimizing cross entropy ( or something similar , which is not clearly defined ) and minimizing minimum description length ( MDL ) by using a binary representation of the network which is optimized with a genetic algorithm .

Moreover , the claims about the binary addition experiments are notably flawed . In particular , the task that is considered in this paper involves two bit sequences that are fed * bit by bit * in parallel to the system . This poses no serious challenge to no RNN , and in fact you can find example code directed at students that solves this task : https : //github.com/mineshmathew/pyTorch_RNN_Examples . ( I have personally tried this code on the same setup of using sequences of up to 20 bits and evaluating on a test set of up to 250 bits with 100 % accuracy -- It only required updating a few lines to more modern versions of python/pytorch and changing the loss to BCE ) . The version of binary addition which is actually more challenging for RNNs is when the output is produced _after_ all operands are given [ 2 ] . Nonetheless , other neural network architectures deal with this task effectively [ 3 ] . I can see two directions in which this work could be improved moving forward : - If the goal is to improve interpretability of models , the authors could aim at tackling problems in gradient-based neural network remain obscure ( e.g.see https : //blackboxnlp.github.io/ ) - If on the other hand the goal is improving generalization , the authors could consider tackling tasks in which neural networks have been shown to be deficient in their generalization skills [ 2 ] . - ( - ) Furthermore , RNN baselines might not be properly trained across the paper .

Presentation choices : apologies , we realize that some of the organization is non-standard . We had to put some of the technical details in the appendix . We want to emphasize here that a large part of our contribution is not technical , not about the details of the implementation of the genetic algorithm , but rather is concerned with what an out-of-the-box version of it can achieve , without manual changes , and adjustments to specific tasks . RNN alternatives : we are using a vanilla version of Genetic Algorithm search ( in the words of Reviewer 2 ) . This was done on purpose , and hopefully it means that our GA training and its RNN competitors ( still the results of decades of research ) were treated fairly . L1 : We agree that RNN results could be improved through a variety of methods , including L1 regularization , dropout manipulations , etc . We thought it was fair to not fine-tune the systems ( neither the RNN nor ours ) any further though . Also , some results achieved by the MDL/GA learner can not be achieved easily in this way , eg , proofs of accuracy had never been done and the networks would still be quite large , presumably . Cells with no input : it is absolutely correct that our networks may grow cells with no input , which is not at all standard . As we now explain ( thank you ) , these cells behave as if their input was 0 ( eg , if the activation function is a sigmoid , it will systematically output 1/2 ) . Typos : integrated , thanks .

For example , it is not clear to me what an output unit with no input produces ( assuming that there is an intercept/bias term , but an explicit remark would be useful ) . - A few typographic/language suggestions/issues : - Footnote marks should go after punctuation ( e.g. , footnote mark 2 ) . - The fonts on figures are sometimes unreadably small , and resolution is not optimal ( especially fig.6 in the appendix , but others may also benefit from high-resolution or vector graphics ) . - Aligning numbers in table 1 properly would increase their readability . - The color choice on figures ( although it did not seem significant ) was not kind to this color blind reader .", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Thank you , we address the various points in order : Scalability and tasks : we agree , see responses to Reviewer 2 . Presentation choices : apologies , we realize that some of the organization is non-standard . We had to put some of the technical details in the appendix . We want to emphasize here that a large part of our contribution is not technical , not about the details of the implementation of the genetic algorithm , but rather is concerned with what an out-of-the-box version of it can achieve , without manual changes , and adjustments to specific tasks . RNN alternatives : we are using a vanilla version of Genetic Algorithm search ( in the words of Reviewer 2 ) . This was done on purpose , and hopefully it means that our GA training and its RNN competitors ( still the results of decades of research ) were treated fairly . L1 : We agree that RNN results could be improved through a variety of methods , including L1 regularization , dropout manipulations , etc . We thought it was fair to not fine-tune the systems ( neither the RNN nor ours ) any further though . Also , some results achieved by the MDL/GA learner can not be achieved easily in this way , eg , proofs of accuracy had never been done and the networks would still be quite large , presumably . Cells with no input : it is absolutely correct that our networks may grow cells with no input , which is not at all standard . As we now explain ( thank you ) , these cells behave as if their input was 0 ( eg , if the activation function is a sigmoid , it will systematically output 1/2 ) . Typos : integrated , thanks . Apologies in particular about the colors , lesson very well learned !"}, "3": {"review_id": "2Ey_1FeNtOC-3", "review_text": "The importance of finding minimum description RNNs is definitely unquestionable for several reasons . Thus the authors address an important problem . They decide to use GA in order to find such a representation . My main reservation is that the paper is a vanilla application of GA without any enhancements or tailored aspects . In other words , I ca n't find methodological or algorithmic contributions . The experimental results also do n't stand out . The tasks selected are all artificial ( learning mathematical operations ) . To this end it would be great to include some practical cases .", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "Thank you ! We agree with the two points made by the reviewers , and we actually tend to see them as features rather than problems . - It is true that the GA is completely standard , we take it as a reason to trust the robustness of the results . The outcome here is : standard methods used in a manner that makes conceptual sense , provide powerful results ( without any manual fine-tuning ) . - The reviewer is also right that the tasks are currently artificial . This is useful to have a clear baseline and a clear understanding of the tasks , and therefore help us confirm that we can read through how the discovered networks are doing the task ( cf.reviewer 2 comments ) . Another worry about this , raised elsewhere , is that the method may not scale up to bigger input/output spaces or to larger corpora . After decades of optimization , neural nets and backprop are optimized to do large tasks smoothly . About the former , it did require some computational optimization indeed , but we are now running versions e.g.MNIST tasks with no computational difficulty . About the latter , we also think that larger corpora can be handled , we take the opportunity to note though that performing well on small corpora is one of the benefits we are investigating for this approach ."}}
