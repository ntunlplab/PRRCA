The general idea has been in the air for some years, and over the last year especially there have been a number of approaches using BayesOpt for this purpose. Reviewers raised concerns about differences between this approach and related work, and practical challenges in general for using BayesOpt in this domain (regarding dimensionality, etc.). The authors provided thoughtful responses, although some of these concerns still remain.

In general, it is very well written and easy to follow. The main contribution is to combine BO with dimension reduction, which leads to the effectiveness in generating black-box adversarial examples in the regime of limited queries. However, I still have some concerns about this paper. 1) The benefits of BO? It seems that the step of dimension reduction is crucial to make BO scablable to high-dimensional problems. I wonder if the gradient estimation-based attack methods can apply the similar trick and yield the similar performance. That is, one can solve problem min_{\\delta} attack_loss( x, y, g(\\delta) ) by estimating gradients via finite-difference of function values, where g(\\cdot) is the dimension-reduction operator, and \\delta is the low-dimensional perturbation. Such a baseline is not clear in the paper, and the comparison with (Tu et al., 2019) is not provided in the paper. 2) Moreover, in experiments, it seems that only query-efficiency was reported. What about distortion-efficiency for BO-based attack? For $\\ell_\\infty$-attacks, the other $\\ell_p$ norms can be used as distortion metrics. I wonder what perturbation does the BO method converge to. It was shown in (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11684.pdf, Table 1) that BO usually leads to larger \\ell_1 and \\ell_2 distortion. 3) It might be useful to show the convergence of BO in terms of objective value versus iterations/queries. This may give a clearer picture on how BO works in the attack generation setting. 4) Minor comment: In related work \"Bayesian optimization has played a supporting role in several methods, including Tu et al.

We address the issues below : 1 ) The benefits of BO ? ... A : This idea of finding adversarial perturbation in low dimension has already been applied in gradient estimation based attack methods . [ 1 ] used data-dependent priors \u2014 a tiling based approach , to improve the black-box adversarial attack performance . We compare this method with Bayes-Attack in section 5.2 and show that the proposed method consistently performs better than [ 1 ] for low query budgets on standard ImageNet models . In this paper , we have focused on untargeted $ \\ell_\\infty $ attacks and compared the baseline models in that domain . Although we do not compare directly to [ 3 ] as they perform $ \\ell_2 $ attacks , we compare the autoencoder-based dimension reduction technique introduced in [ 3 ] in section 5.3 .

In regards to the comparison with [ 1 ] we respectfully disagree with the reviewer for the following reasons : 1 ) In [ 1 ] , the authors limited themselves to a specific class of perturbations which only encompasses shearing and rotation distortion . Furthermore , the set of perturbations ensures that the space over which the optimization is performed is just 3 dimensions , which is an ideal BO use case as BO is particularly effective for lower dimensional optimization . However , in our case the perturbations belong to high dimensional spaces , i.e. , 784 for MNIST , 224x224x3 for VGG-16bn and ResNet and finally 299x299x3 for Inception-v3 . Given the huge difference in the dimensionality of the problem considered in our paper and [ 1 ] , it is not clear how Bayesian optimization ( BO ) in its vanilla form can be by default extended to such high dimensional settings . It is particularly challenging to make BO work in high dimensional optimization problems in a constrained setting which is something we address in this paper , which [ 1 ] does not . 2 ) Moreover , the setting in our paper involves a constrained optimization problem , where the constraint is specified by an $ \\ell_ { \\infty } $ norm . Thus , the novelty of our algorithm with the dimensionality reduction part therein goes above and beyond the algorithm in [ 1 ] . As shown in Figure 3 in Section 5.3 , straight forward application of BO to finding adversarial perturbation in the input space leads to sub-standard results . In this paper , we show how we can run BO in low dimensional space to generate successful adversarial perturbations bounded in $ \\ell_\\infty $ norm in a query efficient manner . 3 ) We also feel that our work considers this problem in much more comprehensive detail than [ 1 ] : we perform experiments across several datasets and deep learning architectures , and compare various methods of upsampling to maximize attack success rate .

However , the setting in [ 1 ] is completely agnostic to query budgets . It is non-trivial to get an understanding of the algorithm in [ 1 ] in query constrained settings . In summary , we study the efficacy of black-box attacks in successfully generating adversarial perturbations for deep learning classifiers in severely query limited settings , e.g. , with a query budget of 100-200 which [ 1 ] does not consider at all while several recent papers have considered query budgets on the order of 10,000 or 100,000 .

A : We agree with the reviewer that this paper is a direct application of BO to the problem of black-box adversarial attacks . However , most existing black-box adversarial attacks take into account per image query budgets of 10000 or sometimes even higher so as to generate successful attacks . The query constrained setting is something which has been largely understudied which brings the question whether successful attacks can be designed for potentially high dimensional models/images such as ImageNet with query budgets of 200 or even lower . While zeroth order optimization algorithms based on finite difference approximation have been used a lot for handling such problems , their performance has been found to be ineffective in constrained query budget setting . Moreover the query efficiency of BO as compared to zeroth order counterparts makes it an ideal candidate for such a setting . In the face of high dimensional constrained optimization , with a constrained query budget , we propose a simple and computationally efficient method to come up with successful adversarial attacks . R : Second , the paper addresses the high dimensional optimisation with simple upsampling technique like nearest-neighbour ... A : We agree with the reviewer that there have been recent works as far as handling high dimensional Bayesian optimization problems are concerned .

So , it is not clear how the previous algorithms handling high dimensional optimization algorithms with BO scale to the dimensions we are considering in this paper . We would like to ask the reviewer to point us to any specific references in this regard which considers employing BO for high-dimensional optimization problems with dimension in the 100000 range . The upsampling technique used in our method is simple as rightly pointed out by the reviewer , but at the same time it is very effective and outperforms much more complex black-box attacks at low query budgets , as we demonstrate across multiple datasets on multiple architectures .
