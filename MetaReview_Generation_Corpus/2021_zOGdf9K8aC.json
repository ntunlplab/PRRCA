We realized that the paper contains errors and it is ambiguous in some parts . Therefore , we have rewritten it significantly and reformulated the equations . * * Point Hierarchical self-supervised tasks * * Both CelebA and Imagenette utilize a series of downscaling transformations ( x : 64x64 - > y1 : 32x32 - > y2 : 16x16 ) . Therefore , we used hierarchical selfVAE in these experiments . We did not use sketching in a hierarchical model , because sketching is equivalent to edge detection . Applying an edge detection transformation to an image consisting of detected edges does not provide any new information . However , it is possible to combine various transformations , e.g. , downscaling and then sketching . Unfortunately , we did not have enough computational resources to carry out these experiments . * * Point How to train/balance operations * * We realized that this figure is rather confusing , and , therefore , we have removed it . The whole subsection on \u201c Generation and Reconstruction in selfVAE \u201d is not about training , it indicates that selfVAE allows us to perform reconstruction and generation in different ways . The training procedure is the same as in any other VAE , namely , we update weights of the encoder , the decoder , and the prior by optimizing the appropriate ELBO . * * Point Performance of self-supervised tasks * * We have tested all models ( i.e. , selfVAEs ) on the density estimation task only . We do not have any experiments on tasks like super-resolution . It is an interesting research direction , and we are sure that our framework could provide a great platform for such tasks . * * Point What is RE and KL in Table & FID scores * * We realized that both RE and KL could be misleading . Therefore , we have removed them from the paper . We have used the WGAN since it is typically reported as a GAN-based baseline in other papers on the likelihood-based models . We did an additional search for a work that achieves state-of-the-art FID scores . As a result , we have replaced the WGAN with the following model : - Ho , J. , Jain , A. , & Abbeel , P. ( 2020 ) . Denoising diffusion probabilistic models . Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems , 33 . This model ( DDPM ) achieves FID that is better than any other GAN , and it is the likelihood-based model . Therefore , for coherence of the comparison , we excluded the WGAN and we decided to exclude any GAN-based model from the table . Nevertheless , we are thankful for providing a couple of relevant papers . Due to the double-blind policy , we can not explain all details of how the project was carried out . Unfortunately , due to some circumstances , we were unable to calculate the scores . * * Point No other models on CelebA * * It is rather surprising , but it is very hard to find a paper that reports bpd on CelebA . There is a vast of papers that use this dataset , but they provide only samples or FID scores . Eventually , after an extensive literature search , we were able to find a score ( bpd ) in the RealNVP that we included in the new version of the paper . We fully agree that having at least one baseline positions our results better . * * Point on Imagenette64 * * We have indicated in the paper that it is a version of the ImageNet dataset provided by FastAI . However , it is obtained in a slightly different manner than the ImageNet64 . First , downscaling is done differently . Second , it is a subset of ImageNet64 . We did our best , but we were unable to find any other paper that used Imagenette for density estimation . We have used Imagenette instead of ImageNet due to limited computational resources . We are aware that this is not the best excuse , but we decided that it is better to provide another dataset that consists of 64x64 images rather than working on simpler models like MNIST or Omniglot that contain 28x28 images ."}, {"review_id": "zOGdf9K8aC-3", "review_text": "This paper targets richer and higher-quality generation with VAE . Two techniques are adopted to achieve the goal : 1 ) . bijective model to enrich data generation with flexible prior . 2 ) .presenting compressed variants of the input data , i.e.self -supervision as additional condition $ y $ , for reconstruction . The two techniques interact through a hierarchical sampling process , $ ... y\\sim p ( y|u ) \\rightarrow z\\sim p ( z|u , y ) $ , thus benefits VAE generation with data-dependent prior and condition generation . The idea novel and reasonable . the paper is clearly presented . Here are some of my concerns . 1.The author specifically argues the transformation $ x \\rightarrow y $ to be 'non-trainable ' , i.e.the mapping between x and y is deterministic . BUT , will modeling $ q ( x|z , y ) $ with discretized logistic distribution , affect the generation quality , since the likelihood is classicly assumed to be Gaussian distributed ? 2.The HIERARCHICAL SELF-SUPERVISED VAE is presented here to show the model can adopt multi-scaling information to benefit generation step-by-step . However , I am afraid , in this way , the inference would be much difficult since the flow-based bijective operation is hard to train already . 3.Is the conditional information , e.g.the sketches , also need in the test phase ? or unconditional generational setting is adopted here . 4.It seems the experiments are not conducted on High-quality datasets . To me , the presented results can not obviously demonstrate the achievements of the model . 5.Can you please explain the connection between your self-supervised VAE to the general conditional VAE model in [ 1 ] .

'' Advances in neural information processing systems . 2015 .", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "First of all , we would like to thank you for your kind words and insightful comments . Please find our response below : * * Point 1 * * This is true that in many papers the decoder , i.e. , $ p ( x|\\ldots ) $ , is modeled as the Gaussian distribution . Unfortunately , this is not correct in the case of images that are represented by integers in $ \\ { 0 , 1 , \\ldots , 255\\ } $ . Variational Auto-Encoders are so-called prescribed latent variable models in which all probability distributions must be defined upfront . Moreover , all distributions must be properly chosen for random variables . By \u201c properly \u201d we mean appropriately to the values that a random variable can take . For instance , Gaussian distribution , which has the support between $ -\\infty $ and $ + \\infty $ , mustn \u2019 t be used for integers . We are aware that it is a common practice to use Gaussians for images , which results in the MSE loss in deep learning packages , but it is not theoretically grounded . Therefore , we used the discretized logistic distribution , which is appropriate for integers , following other papers in the literature , e.g . : - Salimans , T. , Karpathy , A. , Chen , X. , & Kingma , D. P. ( 2017 ) . Pixelcnn++ : Improving the pixelcnn with discretized logistic mixture likelihood and other modifications . ICLR 2017 . * * Point 2 * * It is a very interesting remark . In the very beginning of the project , we checked how selfVAE works while being trained in two stages ( i.e. , for one minibatch , first the encoder and the decoder were updated , and then the bijective prior was updated ) against selfVAE being trained in a standard manner ( i.e. , all weights were updated at once ) . It turned out that there was no difference , and even the standard training seemed to give better results . Therefore , we used the standard training . The flow-based model is considered hard to train when the target data are of high-dimensionality ( i.e.natural images ) . However , in our case , the target distribution is of lower dimensionality ( 1024 dimensions ) which allows up to incorporate the best of both worlds ; a smaller , fast data-dependent prior that does not collapse ( please see for ablation study ) . Given the deterministic transformations , we experienced that the model scales easily while incorporating the bijective prior , without any effort to tune any hyper-parameters . To conclude , given this very reasonable remark , our model was specially designed to scale efficiently and unhesitatingly . Moreover , another possible explanation of this result is the following . A vanilla hierarchical VAE can suffer from posterior collapse because z \u2019 s on top obtain data that are already processed through multiple stochastic layers . However , in our approach , we provide processed data through deterministic and discrete transformations ( e.g. , downscaled images ) , therefore , on top , we have a direct connection to data , and learning a bijective prior p ( u ) is less problematic . * * Point 3 * * In our opinion , the strength of our approach is that we can use either a conditional generation or an unconditional generation . Therefore , regarding your question , we can use both . In the paper , we highlight whether we present unconditional or conditional samples . * * Point 4 * * Partially , we agree with this comment . Applying our approach to CIFAR10 has a rather limited effect because the images are very small ( 32x32 ) . However , results on 64x64 images ( CelebA , Imagenette ) are promising and indicate that both multiple downscaling and sketching have a positive effect . Nevertheless , we would love to apply our approach to larger images , but we simply did not possess enough computational power to accomplish that . We are almost certain that our approach would shine even more on 256x256 or larger images . * * Point 5 * * Thank you for pointing out the paper . We are aware of this paper since it is one of the first successful papers on modeling both image and its label using VAEs . The main difference between the conditional VAE ( CVAE ) and our selfVAE lies in the quantities we model . In our case , we focus on y that is a transformation of $ x $ , $ y=d ( x ) $ , while in the CVAE case , y is a label ( or a segmentation ) . Further , CVAE models the conditional likelihood , $ p ( y|x ) $ , while we model the joint distribution , $ p ( x , y ) $ . We have also rewritten our model slightly to make this distinction even more apparent ."}], "0": {"review_id": "zOGdf9K8aC-0", "review_text": "# # Summary The paper presents a self-supervised variational auto-encoder called selfVAE .

When learning a more structured latent representation , image superresolution , or sketch-to-image networks are also trained . # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Cons : $ \\bullet $ * Hierarchical self-supervised tasks * In section 3.4 , multiple transformations explained . However , none of the experiments are conducted as a consecutive set of transformations . Does 3-level downscale mean a single downscaling three times or generating from $ u $ using four different networks and match each of these levels with $ z $ ? If yes , why does not the selfVAE-sketches model apply in a similar way hierarchically ? $ \\bullet $ * How to train/balance operations * In Figure 3 , there are several modes of operations given . How did you balance these modes during training ? $ \\bullet $ * Performance of self-supervised tasks : * What is the effect of self-supervised tasks ' performance on the quality of latent representations ? Considering the literature in image superresolution and sketch-to-image , did you use a pretrained auxiliary generator ? $ \\bullet $ * What is RE and KL in Table ? * Are they the summation of both reconstruction ( $ RE_x , RE_y $ ) and KL divergence ( $ KL_z , KL_u $ ) terms in the loss ( Eq.2 ) ? The reason why previous methods ' RE/KL values were omitted should be stated . Similarly , why were the FID scores on CelebA and ImageNet-64 not given ? Furthermore , the state-of-the-art FID scores on CIFAR-10 is better than the methods compared in Table 1 . For instance , some examples of FID scores on CIFAR-10 are 18.9 in MoML [ 1 ] , 29.3 in WP-GAN [ 2 ] , 29.3 in spectrally normalized GAN [ 3 ] , 26.4 in adversarial score matching [ 4 ] , and so on .

Minor issue : `` Imagenette64 '' might cause confusion , I did not see this dataset name before . I suppose that it is `` ImageNet resized to 64x64 '' as in PixelCNN paper . References for all datasets should be added . # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Reasons for score : Overall , I rate towards rejection . Even though the idea of bijective priors and doing this through self-supervised tasks is a novel approach , my major concern is that it is beyond the state-of-the-art in CIFAR-10 , not compared to any other method on CelebA and ImageNet-64 . Hopefully , the authors address my concerns above in the rebuttal period .", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "In general , we would like to thank you for your detailed comments . We realized that the paper contains errors and it is ambiguous in some parts . Therefore , we have rewritten it significantly and reformulated the equations . * * Point Hierarchical self-supervised tasks * * Both CelebA and Imagenette utilize a series of downscaling transformations ( x : 64x64 - > y1 : 32x32 - > y2 : 16x16 ) . Therefore , we used hierarchical selfVAE in these experiments . We did not use sketching in a hierarchical model , because sketching is equivalent to edge detection . Applying an edge detection transformation to an image consisting of detected edges does not provide any new information . However , it is possible to combine various transformations , e.g. , downscaling and then sketching . Unfortunately , we did not have enough computational resources to carry out these experiments . * * Point How to train/balance operations * * We realized that this figure is rather confusing , and , therefore , we have removed it . The whole subsection on \u201c Generation and Reconstruction in selfVAE \u201d is not about training , it indicates that selfVAE allows us to perform reconstruction and generation in different ways . The training procedure is the same as in any other VAE , namely , we update weights of the encoder , the decoder , and the prior by optimizing the appropriate ELBO . * * Point Performance of self-supervised tasks * * We have tested all models ( i.e. , selfVAEs ) on the density estimation task only . We do not have any experiments on tasks like super-resolution . It is an interesting research direction , and we are sure that our framework could provide a great platform for such tasks . * * Point What is RE and KL in Table & FID scores * * We realized that both RE and KL could be misleading . Therefore , we have removed them from the paper . We have used the WGAN since it is typically reported as a GAN-based baseline in other papers on the likelihood-based models . We did an additional search for a work that achieves state-of-the-art FID scores . As a result , we have replaced the WGAN with the following model : - Ho , J. , Jain , A. , & Abbeel , P. ( 2020 ) . Denoising diffusion probabilistic models . Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems , 33 . This model ( DDPM ) achieves FID that is better than any other GAN , and it is the likelihood-based model . Therefore , for coherence of the comparison , we excluded the WGAN and we decided to exclude any GAN-based model from the table . Nevertheless , we are thankful for providing a couple of relevant papers . Due to the double-blind policy , we can not explain all details of how the project was carried out . Unfortunately , due to some circumstances , we were unable to calculate the scores . * * Point No other models on CelebA * * It is rather surprising , but it is very hard to find a paper that reports bpd on CelebA . There is a vast of papers that use this dataset , but they provide only samples or FID scores . Eventually , after an extensive literature search , we were able to find a score ( bpd ) in the RealNVP that we included in the new version of the paper . We fully agree that having at least one baseline positions our results better . * * Point on Imagenette64 * * We have indicated in the paper that it is a version of the ImageNet dataset provided by FastAI . However , it is obtained in a slightly different manner than the ImageNet64 . First , downscaling is done differently . Second , it is a subset of ImageNet64 . We did our best , but we were unable to find any other paper that used Imagenette for density estimation . We have used Imagenette instead of ImageNet due to limited computational resources . We are aware that this is not the best excuse , but we decided that it is better to provide another dataset that consists of 64x64 images rather than working on simpler models like MNIST or Omniglot that contain 28x28 images ."}, "3": {"review_id": "zOGdf9K8aC-3", "review_text": "This paper targets richer and higher-quality generation with VAE . Two techniques are adopted to achieve the goal : 1 ) . bijective model to enrich data generation with flexible prior . 2 ) .presenting compressed variants of the input data , i.e.self -supervision as additional condition $ y $ , for reconstruction . The two techniques interact through a hierarchical sampling process , $ ... y\\sim p ( y|u ) \\rightarrow z\\sim p ( z|u , y ) $ , thus benefits VAE generation with data-dependent prior and condition generation . The idea novel and reasonable . the paper is clearly presented . Here are some of my concerns . 1.The author specifically argues the transformation $ x \\rightarrow y $ to be 'non-trainable ' , i.e.the mapping between x and y is deterministic . BUT , will modeling $ q ( x|z , y ) $ with discretized logistic distribution , affect the generation quality , since the likelihood is classicly assumed to be Gaussian distributed ? 2.The HIERARCHICAL SELF-SUPERVISED VAE is presented here to show the model can adopt multi-scaling information to benefit generation step-by-step . However , I am afraid , in this way , the inference would be much difficult since the flow-based bijective operation is hard to train already . 3.Is the conditional information , e.g.the sketches , also need in the test phase ? or unconditional generational setting is adopted here . 4.It seems the experiments are not conducted on High-quality datasets . To me , the presented results can not obviously demonstrate the achievements of the model . 5.Can you please explain the connection between your self-supervised VAE to the general conditional VAE model in [ 1 ] .

'' Advances in neural information processing systems . 2015 .", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "First of all , we would like to thank you for your kind words and insightful comments . Please find our response below : * * Point 1 * * This is true that in many papers the decoder , i.e. , $ p ( x|\\ldots ) $ , is modeled as the Gaussian distribution . Unfortunately , this is not correct in the case of images that are represented by integers in $ \\ { 0 , 1 , \\ldots , 255\\ } $ . Variational Auto-Encoders are so-called prescribed latent variable models in which all probability distributions must be defined upfront . Moreover , all distributions must be properly chosen for random variables . By \u201c properly \u201d we mean appropriately to the values that a random variable can take . For instance , Gaussian distribution , which has the support between $ -\\infty $ and $ + \\infty $ , mustn \u2019 t be used for integers . We are aware that it is a common practice to use Gaussians for images , which results in the MSE loss in deep learning packages , but it is not theoretically grounded . Therefore , we used the discretized logistic distribution , which is appropriate for integers , following other papers in the literature , e.g . : - Salimans , T. , Karpathy , A. , Chen , X. , & Kingma , D. P. ( 2017 ) . Pixelcnn++ : Improving the pixelcnn with discretized logistic mixture likelihood and other modifications . ICLR 2017 . * * Point 2 * * It is a very interesting remark . In the very beginning of the project , we checked how selfVAE works while being trained in two stages ( i.e. , for one minibatch , first the encoder and the decoder were updated , and then the bijective prior was updated ) against selfVAE being trained in a standard manner ( i.e. , all weights were updated at once ) . It turned out that there was no difference , and even the standard training seemed to give better results . Therefore , we used the standard training . The flow-based model is considered hard to train when the target data are of high-dimensionality ( i.e.natural images ) . However , in our case , the target distribution is of lower dimensionality ( 1024 dimensions ) which allows up to incorporate the best of both worlds ; a smaller , fast data-dependent prior that does not collapse ( please see for ablation study ) . Given the deterministic transformations , we experienced that the model scales easily while incorporating the bijective prior , without any effort to tune any hyper-parameters . To conclude , given this very reasonable remark , our model was specially designed to scale efficiently and unhesitatingly . Moreover , another possible explanation of this result is the following . A vanilla hierarchical VAE can suffer from posterior collapse because z \u2019 s on top obtain data that are already processed through multiple stochastic layers . However , in our approach , we provide processed data through deterministic and discrete transformations ( e.g. , downscaled images ) , therefore , on top , we have a direct connection to data , and learning a bijective prior p ( u ) is less problematic . * * Point 3 * * In our opinion , the strength of our approach is that we can use either a conditional generation or an unconditional generation . Therefore , regarding your question , we can use both . In the paper , we highlight whether we present unconditional or conditional samples . * * Point 4 * * Partially , we agree with this comment . Applying our approach to CIFAR10 has a rather limited effect because the images are very small ( 32x32 ) . However , results on 64x64 images ( CelebA , Imagenette ) are promising and indicate that both multiple downscaling and sketching have a positive effect . Nevertheless , we would love to apply our approach to larger images , but we simply did not possess enough computational power to accomplish that . We are almost certain that our approach would shine even more on 256x256 or larger images . * * Point 5 * * Thank you for pointing out the paper . We are aware of this paper since it is one of the first successful papers on modeling both image and its label using VAEs . The main difference between the conditional VAE ( CVAE ) and our selfVAE lies in the quantities we model . In our case , we focus on y that is a transformation of $ x $ , $ y=d ( x ) $ , while in the CVAE case , y is a label ( or a segmentation ) . Further , CVAE models the conditional likelihood , $ p ( y|x ) $ , while we model the joint distribution , $ p ( x , y ) $ . We have also rewritten our model slightly to make this distinction even more apparent ."}}
