Nevertheless , the data distribution does play a role when studying statistical properties of learning algorithms such as ridge regression , in which case the spectrum of the covariance operator comes into play . When the data distribution is uniform on the sphere , this spectrum is the same as the one of the integral operator we study , hence our results also yield tight statistical rates for non-parametric regression , but this is no longer the case for arbitrary distributions ( note however that when the distribution has a density w.r.t.the uniform distribution on the sphere one the eigenvalue decays are preserved up to a constant , leading to similar rates ) . - ( expansions in theorem 1 ) Note that the expansions are not artifacts of the proof , but assumptions that we leverage in our theorem for obtaining appropriate decays by capturing regularity properties of the kernel function .

We hope this clarifies your concern , please let us know if we can clarify this further . Regarding Figure 1 : - For the middle figure , the slight differences between different kernels with the same spectral decay ( e.g.when varying number of layers ) may be due to the difference in constants in the eigenvalues , which may change with depth and with parity ( see , e.g. , Cor.2/3 ) .- Regarding random features , the 2-layer case seems indeed better than 3-layers . While for 2 layers the expectation of the random feature kernel is the desired dot-product kernel , for 3 layers the expectation is only an approximation of the infinite-width kernel , and our experiment suggests that more neurons are required in order to obtain good approximation compared to the 2-layer case . - ( scaling of network width ) Here we focus simply on random features with only the last layer trained , in order to avoid the complications of the linearization step in NTK/lazy training . We focus on scalings m = sqrt ( n ) because they are known to be statistically optimal in various regimes ( see e.g.Rudi and Rosasco , 2017 ) , and because they are more realistic than the typical NTK scalings where m typically needs to be larger than n , a setting which is not be useful in practice since the computational cost would then be larger than simply using the exact kernel along with the representer theorem .

Specifically , the authors analyzed the eigenvalue decays in terms of the power series expansions of the kernel function around some points , which is related to the RKHS of the kernel . This analysis can be used to recover some previous results . Besides , using this analysis , the authors have shown several interesting results , including that NTK ( which corresponds to fully-connected ReLU networks with infinite width , small learning rate , and proper initialization ) with any depth has the same RKHS . The main result also has other corollaries about other kinds of kernels , e.g. , Laplace kernel and infinitely differentiable kernels . Experiments were done to validate the theoretical results on synthetic datasets and MNIST/Fashion-MNIST . Pros : 1.Analyzing the role of depth in deep neural networks is a very important problem , and people observed empirically depth separation phenomena , i.e. , deeper networks have more expressive power . The authors analyzed this problem and showed that NTK constrained to the unit sphere does not have the depth separation phenomenon , which makes this paper interesting . 2.The authors did experiments in a nice way to validate the theoretical results . They did experiments on both synthetic datasets and real datasets , compare different kernels and repeat the experiments multiple times . 3.The experimental methodologies and theoretical computations appear to be correct . Cons : 1.As mentioned by the authors , there is a recent concurrent work ( Chen & Xu , 2020 ) that also obtains the result that NTK with any depth have the same RKHS , but the authors did not provide enough comparisons to that work . It would be better if a more detailed comparison can be provided . 2.The experiments are only done on synthetic datasets/MNIST/Fashion-MNIST with RF/NTK . It would be more convincing if the authors could do experiments with more kernels ( e.g. , Laplace kernel ) or on larger datasets ( e.g. , CIFAR ) .

We now included a more detailed comparison following the related work section . Note that the approach is quite different : their work shows equality of the NTK RKHS with that of the Laplace kernel by showing a double inclusion through asymptotic decays of Taylor coefficients of the kernel function kappa . In contrast , we obtain precise descriptions of the RKHS and regularization properties of the kernel by studying eigenvalue decays in the basis of spherical harmonics , which in particular implies the equality of the deep NTK and Laplace RKHSs due to the fact that RKHS norms are equivalent when the eigenvalue decays are the same . In Chen & Xu , the asymptotic decay of Taylor coefficients is obtained by characterizing singularities on complex analytic extensions of the kernel function , while we only require asymptotic expansions for non-negative reals t , which are sufficient for obtaining the spectral decay . 2.Thank your for your suggestions regarding experiments , we have included the Laplace kernel for comparison , which behaves similarly to the NTK , as predicted by the theory . Note that we decided to avoid more complex vision datasets such as Cifar10 , since those typically require more structured kernels such as convolutional kernels for better performance , while our theory focuses on the role of depth for fully-connected models and our experiments present simple illustrations of our theory . 3.Thank you for your comment regarding the curves in Figure 1 , we did our best to make them readable . Note that the fact that many of them are hard to distinguish is in agreement with our theory , in particular for different numbers of layers with the same kernel ( RF or NTK ) . Indeed , in our setup with non-smooth f * the theory of ridge regression implies that all kernels considered achieve the optimal rate ( which depends on the regularity of f * ) when one is allowed to tune the regularization parameter ( left figure ) . The middle figure illustrates that the RF kernels would need a smaller regularization parameter ( hence solve a more ill-conditioned optimization problem ) compared to NTK/Laplace in order to reach the optimal rate achieved in the left figure , but the behavior is again very similar for different kernels with the same decay ."}, {"review_id": "aDjoksTpXOP-3", "review_text": "Recently , there are a large number of deep learning theory papers related to the property of neural tangent kernel .
