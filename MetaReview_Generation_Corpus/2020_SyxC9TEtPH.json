The key idea is fairly simple modification of the original architecture, but authors also propose techniques for down-sampling with Haar wavelets. The experimental results on class-conditional MNIST generation and colorization are promising. However, in terms of weakness, the technical novelty seems somewhat limited although it's a reasonable extension. In addition, the experimental results lack evaluation on general conditional image generation tasks with more widely used benchmarks (e.g., class-conditional generation setting for real images, such as CIFAR and ImageNet; attribute-conditional or image-to-image translation settings; etc.). In other words, colorization seems like a niche task. The baselines compared are not the strongest models. For example, the diversity of \ncGANs can be significantly improved by simple plug-in modifications (e.g., DSGAN) to any existing GAN architectures, and those methods were demonstrated on broader benchmarks. So I view the experimental validation somewhat limited in scope and significance. While this work presents a reasonable extension of conditional invertible generative models with promising results, I believe that more work needs to be done to be publishable at a top-tier conference.\n\nDiversity-Sensitive Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09024\n\nMode Seeking Generative Adversarial Networks for Diverse Image Synthesis\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05628\n* exactly the same idea as DSGAN above.\n", "reviews": [{"review_id": "SyxC9TEtPH-0", "review_text": "The paper presents an invertible generative network, for conditional image generation. The model is an extension of Real NVP with a conditioning component. Experiments are performed for image generation on two tasks: class conditional generation on MNIST and image colorization conditioned on a grey scale image (luminance). Comparisons are performed with a conditional VAE and a conditional GAN (Pix2Pix). An ablation study motivates the importance and role of the different components. The model itself is a relatively simple extension of Real NVP, where a condition vector is added to the initial model as an additional input to the NN components of the invertible blocks. In the experiments conditioning may be a simple class indicator (MNIST) or a more complex component corresponding to a NN mapping of an initial conditioning image (colorization). The experiments show that this model is able to generate good quality images, with an important diversity, showing that the conditioning mechanism works well. The quantitative comparison also shows that the proposed model is competitive with two baselines taken in the VAE and GAN families. The model works well for the non-trivial task of colorization. The authors claim is that they are the first to propose conditional invertible networks. The main contribution is probably the implementation of the model itself. They make use of several \u201ctricks\u201d that improve a lot on the performance as demonstrated by the ablation study. As such more details and motivations for these different ideas that improve the performance and stability of the model would be greatly helpful. It looks like these are not details, but requirements to make the whole thing work. The Haar component for example should be better motivated. There is no comparison in the ablation study with an alternative, simpler decomposition. The baselines are probably not the strongest models to date, and better results could certainly be obtained with other VAE or GAN variants. For example, there have been several works trying to introduce diversity for GANs. This is not redhibitory, but this should be mentioned. Besides a short description of the two baselines, would make the paper more self-contained. The quantitative comparison with the VAE baseline, shows that the two models are quite similar w.r.t. different measures. This could be also commented. The notations for the Jacobian do not integrate the conditioning, this could be corrected. Concerning the interpretation of the axis for the MNIST experiment, it is not clear if they are axis in the original space or PCA axis. If this is the first option, more details are needed in order to understand how they were selected. ------post rebuttal ----- The authors clarified several of the raised points. I keep my score.

Conditioning is injected into the model via a conditional affine coupling block, which concatenates conditioning with the input to the scaling and shifting sub-networks in the coupling block. Other small modification are proposed to improve training stability at higher learning rates, including soft clamping of scaling coefficients, and Haar wavelet downsampling, which is proposed to replace the squeeze operation (pixel shuffle) that is often used in flow-based models. The invertibility of the cINN allows for style transfer by projecting images into the latent space, and then reconstructing the image with a different conditioning. The performance of the cINN is evaluated empirically on the task of colorization, where it is shown to outperform other techniques in terms of nearness to the true colours, as well as sample diversity. Overall, I would tend to vote for accepting this paper. The base method for integrating conditioning into the flow is simple and intuitive, and additional modifications which allow for stable training at higher learning rates, such as soft clamping and Haar wavelet downsampling, appear to be very effective. Conditional models often lend themselves to a wide variety of useful applications, so I think this work could be of interest to many. My primary concerns with this paper are related to the comparison of image colorization methods. Specifically: 1) I would like to see a comparison to Probabilistic Image Colorization (PIC) [1], which was mentioned in the related work section but not included in the comparison of colorization models. PIC has been shown to outperform VAE-MDN in terms of diversity, so it would be good to include it. Code is available online with pretrained ImageNet models (https://github.com/ameroyer/PIC), so it should not be difficult to add. 2) Pix2pix is known to have very bad sample diversity. A more useful comparison would be to evaluate one of the newer variants of Pix2pix that emphasizes sample diversity, such as BicycleGAN [2] or MSGAN [3]. Code is also available for each of these models (https://github.com/junyanz/BicycleGAN, https://github.com/HelenMao/MSGAN), although you would need to train models from scratch. 3) Pixel-wise metrics such as MSE are bad at measuring perceptual similarity. While these pixel-wise metrics are still useful for comparison to prior work, better metrics are available for evaluating image colorization. I would recommend the use of Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) [4] in place of pixel-wise distance measures for evaluating image similarity and diversity. Things to improve the paper that did not impact the score: 5) I was somewhat disappointed by how little attention was spent on the Haar wavelet downsampling method. It seems like a very neat idea, but it is only briefly explored in the ablation study. It would be nice to include a more in-depth study of how it compares to the conventional pixel shuffle downsampling, perhaps in terms of stability with learning rates, and final model performance. 6) There is some potentially related work on conditional adversarial generative flows [5] that could be added to the literature review if deemed relevant enough.

I did not realize that they would take so long to run, but I think it important to include comparison with the current SOTA methods so that we have some reference. It is also nice to see the addition of the LPIPS metric. My overall opinion of the paper is not much changed from before, so I will retain the same score.
