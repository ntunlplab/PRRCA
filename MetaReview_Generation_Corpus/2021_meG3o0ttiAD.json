The main contribution of this work is to show a theoretical lower bound that the gradient of the two neural networks (at random initialization) with respect to certain training objectives is well lower bounded by 2^{-2 L}, where L is the number of layers in the network. Previously, the known work only manage to prove this lower bound with less-realistic QNNs with 2-design, or prove an 2^{-poly(n)} lower bounds for random QNNs, where the input of the neural network is an n-qubit. This paper makes a first step towards solving the vanishing gradient problem of QNNs at random initialization. \n\n\n\nThe major concern of the paper is the usefulness of these QNNs with proposed architectures: The proposed QNNs might be theoretically easier to train, but what if they can only learn a significantly smaller class of functions? In classical world, such phenomenons are very common: Linear classifiers (or even linear functions over prescribed feature mappings) are much easier to train and have much better theoretical properties, but they fail short in terms of representation power comparing to real neural networks.\n\n\n\nIn this paper, on the theory side, there is no argument about the representation power of these QNNs: It is unclear which set of functions they can represent efficiently, which limits their theoretical interests to machine learning committee. On the empirical side, the reviewers all agree that the empirical results are weak at this point: The proposed new QNNs did not show significant advantages over random QNNs (especially with early stopping), and other types of QNNs were not compared. Moreover, there seems to be some efficiency issue regarding implementing these QNNs -- More convincing empirical evidence or theoretical evidence about the power of these QNNs need to be addressed.

This work provides a detailed analysis of quantum neural networks with a tree structure that uses only a depth logarithmic in the system size . The authors show that the gradient signal will only be polynomially small with respect to the system size . The authors also provide empirical verification of the theoretical analysis showing a much larger gradient norm . However , the improvement in prediction accuracy ( under early stopping ) when using tree-structure quantum neural networks is not very significant . This is likely because the considered system size ( 8 qubits ) is too small to fully demonstrate the exponential decay and the inability to train random quantum neural networks . # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Reasons for score : I think the theoretical analysis of the tree-structure quantum neural networks is nice . It provides a rigorous result for training a promising class of quantum neural networks . The proven result can be derived in a straightforward manner if we know that the gradient signal decays exponentially in the depth ( which is not what was originally stated in the barren plateau paper [ 1 ] , the result in [ 1 ] only shows an exponential decay in the system size after a depth linear in the system size ) . This is because a quantum neural network with a tree structure only has a log ( n ) depth , so the gradient norm would be 2^ { -log ( n ) } = 1/n . However , I do n't think this intuition that gradient signal decays exponentially in circuit depth is widely known , so this work still provides a novel contribution from a theoretical aspect . # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Pros : Pros : 1 .

Experiments with 8 qubits are too small and a gradient norm of 0.2 ( for random QNN ) is quite large . This is likely the cause of the lack of a large prediction advantage when using TT-QNN . Random QNN is just completely untrainable in large system sizes . Numerical experiments with a large system size will likely make the paper much stronger from an empirical perspective ( if we can see a larger improvement in prediction error ) .

We provide discussions and explanations around the reviewer 's concerns as follows . 1.The proven result can be derived in a straightforward manner if we know that the gradient signal decays exponentially in the depth . Re : The phenomenon that the gradient signal decays exponentially in the depth is discussed in papers [ 1,2 ] and other following works , which employ the ( global or local ) unitary 2-design assumptions on gates in the circuit . Our first concern is that unitary 2-design is in fact a finite gate set that may not suit continuously tuned gates in variational quantum circuits . Thus a consideration could be eliminated by changing the 2-design assumption into tuned gates lie in the unitary space , which in fact do not change the formulation of previous results due to the definition of the 2-design . However , tuned gates in the unitary space are hard to implement directly on today 's or near-term quantum computers , especially for gates on more than one qubit . Besides , as mentioned at the beginning of Section 3.2 , gates in the unitary space could introduce the { RX , RZ } gates and may worsen the performance of QNNs in real-world problems ( as shown in Appendix A.4 ) . As a conclusion , QNN analysis without the 2-design assumptions is required , which is the main motivation of this work . On the other hand , we investigate quantum neural networks with other different structures in the newly updated versions , namely the step controlled ( SC ) QNNs ( Figure 2 in Section 3.2 ) . We emphasize that the SC-QNN has a circuit depth linear to the qubit number , however , the corresponding gradient norm is bounded by the term independent from the qubit number ( Theorem 3.1 ) . The result of the SC-QNN implies the difference between our theoretical framework and the previous 2-design based frameworks . 2.We do not see a large improvement in prediction accuracy when the random quantum neural network employs early stopping . For example , in fig . 4 ( a ) , we can stop at iteration 50~60 and the prediction error of the random quantum neural network would be fairly small .

Numerical experiments with a large system size will likely make the paper much stronger from an empirical perspective ( if we can see a larger improvement in prediction error ) . Re : Thanks for the constructive suggestions ! We implement numerical simulations on different QNNs with qubit number { 8,10,12 } which are presented in Section 4.2 and Appendix A.2 . The results suggest that TT-QNNs and SC-QNNs remain good trainability to qubit size at least up to 12 with test accuracy higher than 0.8 . Random QNNs show some sort of trainability for the 8 and 10 qubits case with test accuracy 0.70-0.80 and become totally untrainable when the qubit number is 12 . 3.The proposed TT-QNN will have a limited expressibility due to the logarithmic depth . Do you know any application where the target function can be represented using a TT-QNN ? Re : We notice the TT-QNN structure in the paper [ 3 ] , in which TT-QNNs are used for 1 ) real-world problems like classifying MNIST , and 2 ) classifying quantum states from different physical processes . 4.Lower bound show be $ \\Omega ( ) $ rather than $ \\mathcal { O } ( ) $ : Re : Thanks for pointing out the problem of complexity notations !

This should be analyzed . Does it mean that the chosen test data is not very sufficient to represent the performance of the model ? Re : The figure 4d in the original paper shows the training error is 10\\ % larger than the test error on the binary classification task between the image class 0 and 1 . We consider the following settings as the potential resources for this phenomenon . Firstly , the small-size ( 100 $ \\times $ 2 ) test set used in the original version could be a potential reason , due to the lack of sufficiency for representing the performance of the model . Another reason could be the small batch size along with the small training iteration , which may cause overfitting on a certain subset of the training data . To address these considerations , we make the following improvements in the revised version : 1 ) we change the batch size from 2 to 20 , and 2 ) we extend test sets from 100 to 400 samples for each class . As shown in Table 4 and Table 5 in Appendix A.3 , such a phenomenon has disappeared ( for most experiments ) or alleviated ( for special pairs like ( 1,4 ) and ( 2,4 ) ) . 2.The classification accuracy is not a very good criterion to evaluate the binary classification performance , F1 score would be much appropriate . Re : Thanks for the suggestion . Experiments in the original paper are conducted on the balanced dataset ( i.e. , different image classes have the same size of training or test sets ) , so we simply analyze the error ( accuracy ) of different QNNs . To better evaluate the performances of QNNs , we count the F1-score for classification tasks in the newly updated version as well . Table 1 in Section 4.2 and Table 4,5 in Appendix A.3 provide an example of results , in which the F1-score on the test set is calculated . The TT-QNN and the SC-QNN show higher accuracy and F1-score than the Random-QNN for all class pairs . 3.Only 0-1 classification experiment was conducted , the results of some other pairs should also be provided .

The numerical simulation on binary classification tasks for TT-QNNs , SC-QNNs , and Random-QNNs are presented in Figure 5 , Table 1 in Section 4.2 and Table 4,5 in Appendix A.3 . Results show that the performance of TT-QNNs and SC-QNNs is better than that of Random-QNNs in terms of test accuracy , training accuracy , and F1-score . 5.I believe that TT-QNN has better trainability and can solve the gradient vanishing . This paper only discussed an example structure and it is doubtable to generalize to other structures .

This work provides a detailed analysis of quantum neural networks with a tree structure that uses only a depth logarithmic in the system size . The authors show that the gradient signal will only be polynomially small with respect to the system size . The authors also provide empirical verification of the theoretical analysis showing a much larger gradient norm . However , the improvement in prediction accuracy ( under early stopping ) when using tree-structure quantum neural networks is not very significant . This is likely because the considered system size ( 8 qubits ) is too small to fully demonstrate the exponential decay and the inability to train random quantum neural networks . # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Reasons for score : I think the theoretical analysis of the tree-structure quantum neural networks is nice . It provides a rigorous result for training a promising class of quantum neural networks . The proven result can be derived in a straightforward manner if we know that the gradient signal decays exponentially in the depth ( which is not what was originally stated in the barren plateau paper [ 1 ] , the result in [ 1 ] only shows an exponential decay in the system size after a depth linear in the system size ) . This is because a quantum neural network with a tree structure only has a log ( n ) depth , so the gradient norm would be 2^ { -log ( n ) } = 1/n . However , I do n't think this intuition that gradient signal decays exponentially in circuit depth is widely known , so this work still provides a novel contribution from a theoretical aspect . # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Pros : Pros : 1 .

We provide discussions and explanations around the reviewer 's concerns as follows . 1.The proven result can be derived in a straightforward manner if we know that the gradient signal decays exponentially in the depth . Re : The phenomenon that the gradient signal decays exponentially in the depth is discussed in papers [ 1,2 ] and other following works , which employ the ( global or local ) unitary 2-design assumptions on gates in the circuit . Our first concern is that unitary 2-design is in fact a finite gate set that may not suit continuously tuned gates in variational quantum circuits . Thus a consideration could be eliminated by changing the 2-design assumption into tuned gates lie in the unitary space , which in fact do not change the formulation of previous results due to the definition of the 2-design . However , tuned gates in the unitary space are hard to implement directly on today 's or near-term quantum computers , especially for gates on more than one qubit . Besides , as mentioned at the beginning of Section 3.2 , gates in the unitary space could introduce the { RX , RZ } gates and may worsen the performance of QNNs in real-world problems ( as shown in Appendix A.4 ) . As a conclusion , QNN analysis without the 2-design assumptions is required , which is the main motivation of this work . On the other hand , we investigate quantum neural networks with other different structures in the newly updated versions , namely the step controlled ( SC ) QNNs ( Figure 2 in Section 3.2 ) . We emphasize that the SC-QNN has a circuit depth linear to the qubit number , however , the corresponding gradient norm is bounded by the term independent from the qubit number ( Theorem 3.1 ) . The result of the SC-QNN implies the difference between our theoretical framework and the previous 2-design based frameworks . 2.We do not see a large improvement in prediction accuracy when the random quantum neural network employs early stopping . For example , in fig . 4 ( a ) , we can stop at iteration 50~60 and the prediction error of the random quantum neural network would be fairly small .

Numerical experiments with a large system size will likely make the paper much stronger from an empirical perspective ( if we can see a larger improvement in prediction error ) . Re : Thanks for the constructive suggestions ! We implement numerical simulations on different QNNs with qubit number { 8,10,12 } which are presented in Section 4.2 and Appendix A.2 . The results suggest that TT-QNNs and SC-QNNs remain good trainability to qubit size at least up to 12 with test accuracy higher than 0.8 . Random QNNs show some sort of trainability for the 8 and 10 qubits case with test accuracy 0.70-0.80 and become totally untrainable when the qubit number is 12 . 3.The proposed TT-QNN will have a limited expressibility due to the logarithmic depth . Do you know any application where the target function can be represented using a TT-QNN ? Re : We notice the TT-QNN structure in the paper [ 3 ] , in which TT-QNNs are used for 1 ) real-world problems like classifying MNIST , and 2 ) classifying quantum states from different physical processes . 4.Lower bound show be $ \\Omega ( ) $ rather than $ \\mathcal { O } ( ) $ : Re : Thanks for pointing out the problem of complexity notations !

We provide discussions and explanations around the reviewer 's concerns as follows . 1.In figure 4d , the blue lines showed that the training error is 10\\ % larger than testing error . This should be analyzed . Does it mean that the chosen test data is not very sufficient to represent the performance of the model ? Re : The figure 4d in the original paper shows the training error is 10\\ % larger than the test error on the binary classification task between the image class 0 and 1 . We consider the following settings as the potential resources for this phenomenon . Firstly , the small-size ( 100 $ \\times $ 2 ) test set used in the original version could be a potential reason , due to the lack of sufficiency for representing the performance of the model . Another reason could be the small batch size along with the small training iteration , which may cause overfitting on a certain subset of the training data . To address these considerations , we make the following improvements in the revised version : 1 ) we change the batch size from 2 to 20 , and 2 ) we extend test sets from 100 to 400 samples for each class . As shown in Table 4 and Table 5 in Appendix A.3 , such a phenomenon has disappeared ( for most experiments ) or alleviated ( for special pairs like ( 1,4 ) and ( 2,4 ) ) . 2.The classification accuracy is not a very good criterion to evaluate the binary classification performance , F1 score would be much appropriate . Re : Thanks for the suggestion . Experiments in the original paper are conducted on the balanced dataset ( i.e. , different image classes have the same size of training or test sets ) , so we simply analyze the error ( accuracy ) of different QNNs . To better evaluate the performances of QNNs , we count the F1-score for classification tasks in the newly updated version as well . Table 1 in Section 4.2 and Table 4,5 in Appendix A.3 provide an example of results , in which the F1-score on the test set is calculated . The TT-QNN and the SC-QNN show higher accuracy and F1-score than the Random-QNN for all class pairs . 3.Only 0-1 classification experiment was conducted , the results of some other pairs should also be provided . Re : Thanks for the suggestion . We have added results of experiments with different class pairs $ ( i , j ) \\in \\ { 0,1,2,3,4\\ } $ at Table 1 , Section 4.2 and Table 4,5 in Appendix A.3 .

Re : Thanks for the suggestion . We have added the analysis on the step controlled quantum neural network ( SC-QNN ) ( Figure 2 , Section 3.2 ) in the revised version . The numerical simulation on binary classification tasks for TT-QNNs , SC-QNNs , and Random-QNNs are presented in Figure 5 , Table 1 in Section 4.2 and Table 4,5 in Appendix A.3 . Results show that the performance of TT-QNNs and SC-QNNs is better than that of Random-QNNs in terms of test accuracy , training accuracy , and F1-score . 5.I believe that TT-QNN has better trainability and can solve the gradient vanishing . This paper only discussed an example structure and it is doubtable to generalize to other structures . Re : As mentioned in previous responses , we present a new class of quantum neural networks , namely , the SC-QNN , with theoretical analysis ( in Section 3.2 and Appendix F ) and numerical experiments ( in Section 4.2 and Appendix A ) . Both theoretical and experimental results suggest the good trainability of SC-QNNs . 6.This paper ( with 20 pages ) exceeds the maximum size of ICLR which is 8 pages . Re : Our main text of the original paper does not exceed the ICLR paper limitation ( 8 pages ) . The limitation on the ICLR submission is the 8 pages size for the main paper which does not conclude the reference and the appendix parts . There is no limitation on the page size of the reference or the appendix . Besides , the limitation on the size of the main text of the rebuttal paper is 9 pages , and the main text of our revised version does not exceed this limitation as well ."}}
