Then, the reconstruction with minimal loss is selected and updated to improve the fit against the target image. The most important control experiment in my opinion should compare this approach against the same architecture with only with m=1 noise vector (i.e., using a constant noise vector all the time). Unfortunately, the paper does not include such a comparison, which means the main hypothesis of the paper is not tested. Please include this experiment in the revised version of the paper.\n\nPS: There is another high level concern regarding the use of PSNR or SSIM for evaluation of super-resolution methods. As shown by \"Pixel recursive super resolution (Dahl et al.)\" and others, PSNR and SSIM metrics are only relevant in the low magnification regime, in which techniques based on MSE (mean squared error) are very competitive. Maybe you need to consider large magnification regime in which GAN and normalized flow-based models are more relevant.", "reviews": [{"review_id": "HklyMhCqYQ-0", "review_text": "- Summary This paper proposes a method based on implicit maximum likelihood estimation for single-image super-resolution. The proposed method aims at avoiding common artifacts such as high-frequency noise and shape distortion. The proposed method shows better performance than SRGAN in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and human evaluation of realism on the ImageNet dataset. - Pros - The proposed method shows better performance than SRGAN in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and human evaluation. - The selection of the evaluation methods is appropriate. In the field of image super-resolution tasks, both signal accuracy (e.g., PSNR) and perceptual quality (e.g., human evaluation) are important. - Cons - The experiments are conducted thoroughly in the ImageNet, but the selection of the dataset is not appropriate. It would be better to apply the proposed method to other datasets which are used recent papers. - Also, the selection of the methods to be compared is not appropriate. It would be better to provide recent state-of-the-art methods and compare the proposed method with them. The proposed approach is interesting and promising, but the selection of the methods and datasets to be compared is not appropriate.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Thank you for your review . We note that the existing datasets commonly used in the super-resolution literature for evaluation are quite small ( they typically contain < =100 images ) , whereas ImageNet is a lot bigger and can provide more reliable results . Common super-resolution testing datasets are also typically used in a high-resolution setting ( i.e.fairly high-resolution inputs are fed into the super-resolution algorithm ) , whereas our experiments are conducted with 64x64 inputs , which can contain 3-6x fewer pixels than the inputs that are used with common datasets . Because the typical inputs are at higher resolutions , the typical setting is easier and so differences between different methods are harder to discern , which is why we performed evaluation under a more challenging setting . However , as per your request , we have updated our paper to include a comparison of our method to SRGAN on the commonly used dataset of Set14 in the appendix and found that both methods perform comparably , but note that this comparison is less informative because all methods perform well on Set14 . We have also updated our paper to include comparisons to more recent methods in the appendix , including EnhanceNet , SFT network , EDSR network and RDN .

To train the sub-networks , we first train the sub-network for the lower input resolution ; then we add the second sub-network on top and train both sub-networks jointly . The feature space is pre-trained and fixed in our setting .

To productionize such a network in real-time systems , we can use established techniques for model compression and binarization . Our approach is as easy to productionize as GAN-based methods because the sampling procedure for our method and GAN are the same at test time ( only the training algorithm differs ) . Multi-modality could be a problem in this case because it is important in various applications to have control over which mode we want to output ; for example , if we \u2019 d like to super-resolve all frames in a video , we need to make sure the same mode is selected consistently across all frames , so that the blurry regions are super-resolved in the same way in all frames . To choose one specific mode in a conscious way , we can simply choose a noise input that results in a super-resolved image that we prefer and use this ( fixed ) noise input for all low-resolution input images . In our paper , we focused on a more challenging setting than that is typically considered in the literature , where the input image is of a relatively low resolution ( 64x64 ) . We chose this setting because most existing methods already perform very well when the input is of a higher resolution , and so the differences between different methods are easier to discern under a more challenging lower-resolution setting .
