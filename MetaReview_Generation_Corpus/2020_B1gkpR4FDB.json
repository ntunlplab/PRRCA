EDIT after rebuttal: My concerns have been addressed, I revise my rating from weak reject to weak accept.", "rating": "6: Weak Accept", "reply_text": "We thank Reviewer # 3 for the careful review . It appears that the main concern is the difference between SASA in Lang et al . ( 2019 ) and SASA+ proposed in this paper . Due to the page limit of the paper , we can not elaborate much on the differences , but we make them clear below and in Appendix B of the revised version . The first difference is that we derived a \u201c master condition for stationary \u201d Equation ( 10 ) that applies to any stochastic optimization methods with constant hyperparameters ( e.g. , SGD , stochastic heavy-ball , NAG , QHM , etc ) , while the stationary condition in Yaida ( 2018 ) and SASA ( Lang et al. , 2019 ) ( see Equation ( 11 ) in our paper ) only applies to the stochastic heavy ball method . Moreover , our condition ( 10 ) is analytically simpler , because it only requires collecting $ x^k $ and $ d^k $ , whereas SASA \u2019 s condition requires $ x^k $ , $ d^k $ , and $ g^k $ . Our condition can be implemented in software packages without knowing how the direction $ d^k $ is generated and does not need any specific hyperparameters such as $ \\beta $ for momentum or $ \\nu $ for QHM . Therefore , due to the general applicability and simplicity of our condition , \u201c it greatly simplifies implementation and deployment in software packages. \u201d We believe such a generality is a major progress over SASA in Lang et al . ( 2019 ) and Yaida ( 2018 ) . The second difference is in the statistical tests used by SASA and SASA+ . In particular , the statistical test in SASA+ is as below : H0 : stationary vs H1 : non-stationary . Under the null hypothesis H0 , SASA+ computes the likelihood of the stationary condition Equation ( 10 ) . If the likelihood is low , then we are confident to reject the null hypothesis ( stationarity ) and do * not * decrease the learning rate . In other words , when it is * not * confident enough to reject the null hypothesis ( stationarity ) , SASA+ decreases the learning rate . SASA in Lang et al.did not explicitly state its null and alternative hypothesis . According to Equation ( 10 ) in Lang et al. , its statistical test can be formulated as below : H0 : $ |z| \\ge \\delta |v| $ vs H1 : $ |z| < \\delta |v| $ . SASA computes the likelihood of $ |z| \\ge \\delta |v| $ . If the likelihood is low ( i.e. , its Equation ( 10 ) ) , then SASA is confident to reject the null hypothesis and decrease the learning rate . One can see that $ |z| \\ge \\delta |v| $ is a relaxed version of $ |z| > 0 $ , i.e. , the process is non-stationary . Therefore , we claim that SASA sets non-stationarity as the null hypothesis . Moreover , due to its non-stationary null hypothesis , SASA has to introduce the extra hyperparameter $ \\delta $ , which is not needed in the SASA+ \u2019 s simpler test . SASA \u2019 s test is an \u201c equivalence test \u201d ( see SASA \u2019 s reference Streiner 2003 ) , whereas the test in SASA+ , as you point out , is a simple confidence interval test . * * We put a more detailed discussion in Appendix B of the revised version . * * Combining the above two differences in stationary conditions and statistical tests , SASA+ is more elegant conceptually and much more generally applicable in practice than SASA . Replies to your other comments : \u201c Adam could have benefited from a finer learning rate schedule , as it is only decreased once compared to several time for the SGD . I would indeed expect a performance gap between Adam and SGD , but I think most of it in this case comes from the one step schedule. \u201d Adam is designed as an \u201c self-adaptive \u201d stochastic optimization algorithm , like our SASA+ and SALSA . It adapts the learning rate per parameter at every step . In this sense , Adam has the finest learning rate schedule . The fair comparison between Adam and SASA+ is starting both algorithms and letting them self-adapt the learning rate . In fact , we even tune the warm-up for Adam so that it can reach reasonable accuracy for ImageNet , while our SASA+ and SALSA do not need this warm-up at all . \u201c Line search is performed but no metrics were shown to discuss the computational overhead of evaluating the model and its gradients for different parameters during the search. \u201d When we fix the number of training epochs , the wall-clock time of Smoothed Stochastic Line Search ( SSLS ) is about 1.5 times of that of the plain stochastic optimization algorithm . This 0.5 computational overhead is due to 2 function evaluations in each line search step on average . Notice that the function evaluation is on the same minibatch and line search only needs the function value without gradient . In SALSA , we switch from SSLS to SALSA at one-third of the total training epochs . Therefore , the total computational overhead caused by using SSLS is only 0.15 of the original total training time ."}, {"review_id": "B1gkpR4FDB-1", "review_text": "This paper proposes a new way of automatically scheduling the learning rate in stochastic optimization algorithms: Stochastic Approximation with Line-search and Statistical Adaptation (SALSA).

For this, the authors derived their own version of a Statistical Adaptive Stochastic Approximation algorithm called SASA+ based on their statistical test. The resulting strategy benefits from being simpler than previous statistical tests while being equally effective empirically. The authors empirically demonstrated that their new learning rate scheduling mechanism achieves comparable, if not better, accuracy on two image classification tasks with ResNet-18 neural networks. It is important to note that the compared baselines got their parameters slightly fine-tuned, while (according to the authors) the proposed approach was not fine-tuned, and only the default parameters were used. This shows the robustness of the proposed approach against its various parameter settings. I would accept this submission because the authors propose a new learning rate scheduling mechanism that seems to perform well empirically while being robust against its different initial parameter settings (including the choice of the initial learning rate). This paper has several novelties: first, it proposes a simpler, yet as effective as previous approaches, Statistical Adaptive Stochastic Approximation (SASA) algorithm based on a new statistical test for non-stationarity. Second, it manages to relax the dependence of SASA algorithms on their optimal initial learning rate by introducing a Smoothed Stochastic Line Search (SSLS) algorithm that is responsible for finding such an optimal initial learning rate. Combined together, these two sub-routine provide a robust mechanism to schedule the learning rate in stochastic optimization problems. One improvement I could suggest to better motivate the proposed approach is to experiment it not only on Convolutional-based networks with image classification tasks but also on Recurrent-based networks with text datasets.

Statistical tests are presented to check the stationarity of the gradient updates. And stochastic line-search methods are proposed to warm up the optimization process during early phases. Pros: The main idea is to check the non-stationarity of the iterates and decrease the learning rate if stationarity is detected. To check stationarity, a quadratic approximation for the objective is used. Another procedure for how to decrease the learning rate is proposed using a stochastic line search. The idea makes sense to me. Cons: -- The quadratic approximation simply assumes that the Hessian matrix of the objective is identity (Equation 10 in Section 2). I appreciate the simplicity of this formulation. Indeed quadratic forms are good local approximations for any general function. On the other hand, it is quite possible that the Hessian matrix has a low-rank structure or has a sharply decaying spectrum. This kind of scenario naturally arise in high-dimensional settings where the model has lots of parameters. Therefore, it seems to me that further justification (either empirical or theoretical) could help clarify the intuition better. -- The experimental results compare the proposed method to other well-known methods such as SGD and ADAM. From Figure 1 and Figure 5, it seems that the proposed method performs comparatively to both SGD and ADAM. In particular, it is not obvious from the experimental results that there is a huge benefit obtained from the proposed methods. Hence the experimental results seem a bit incremental to me, as far as I can tell.

However , the review comments show major misunderstandings of the method and the goal of the paper , which we elaborate below . First , we do * not * make any quadratic approximation of the objective function F ( x ) . On the contrary , the advantage of our method is that it applies to all objective functions in the general stochastic optimization form given in Equation ( 1 ) , regardless of quadraticity or convexity of F ( x ) . We state clearly in the paragraph after Equation ( 10 ) on page 3 : `` This condition holds * exactly * for any stochastic optimization method of the form ( 6 ) if it reaches stationarity ... Beyond stationarity , it requires no specific assumption on the loss function or noise model for the stochastic gradients . '' In fact , a necessary and sufficient condition for stationarity is that Equation ( 8 ) holds for any test function $ \\phi $ . Here we derive a necessary condition by setting the test function to be a simple quadratic function $ \\phi ( x ) = ( 1/2 ) \\|x\\|^2 $ . If we reject any necessary condition , we reject the null hypothesis of stationarity . We could also use any other function as the testing function , including the objective function F ( x ) itself , but this can result in conditions that are very hard to check without approximation . The test function $ \\phi $ and the objective function F ( x ) do not need to be related . Using a quadratic test function leads to the simple necessary condition ( 10 ) that works exactly for any objective function F ( x ) . In addition , our master condition ( 10 ) also works for general stochastic optimization algorithm of the form ( 6 ) where the direction $ d^k $ can be the stochastic gradient , or combined with momentum , or generated by the QHM dynamics in ( 7 ) , or even more general . And the master condition ( 10 ) is still * exact * for testing ( non ) -stationarity . There is no approximation involved here either . Second , as we stated in the last part of the introduction , our proposed algorithm SALSA is a highly * autonomous * algorithm to increase/decrease its learning rate automatically , and it matches best performance of * hand-tuned methods * ( SGD and Adam ) on the two benchmark tasks in this paper . The advantage of SALSA is its automation , not necessarily achieving higher testing accuracy . In fact , for the CIFAR10 and ImageNet dataset , with fixed network architectures ( ResNet18 ) , researchers and engineers have extensively * hand-tuned * different kinds of algorithms for years to obtain the accuracy reported in this paper , which may be the limit of the ResNet18 architecture . In our experiments , SALSA robustly achieves this accuracy automatically without tuning hyperparameters . We believe such progress is beyond `` incremental . '' In addition , the line search procedure we propose ( SSLS ) tackles another major challenge of running any stochastic gradient type of method : how does one set the initial learning rate ? We have shown empirically that SSLS can start from an arbitrarily small learning rate and gradually reach a stable learning rate that matches the initial learning rate of hand-tuned schedules . Thus by combining SSLS and SASA+ , our SALSA algorithm is fully automatic in the sense that it can automatically search for a stable learning rate for the initial phase of training and then decrease it to obtain best performance . For \u201c More comments \u201d : In our paper , $ \\xi $ is not denoting the data point , but the randomness in the stochastic optimization algorithm , e.g. , mini-batch sampling in empirical risk minimization . Using $ \\xi $ to denote the per-step randomness is a standard notation for stochastic optimization ."}], "0": {"review_id": "B1gkpR4FDB-0", "review_text": "The authors explore how stationarity tests can be leveraged to automatically tune the learning rate during training.

SASA+ automatically adapt their learning rate ( see Figure 5 Bottom Right figure ) , achieves comparable and even slightly higher testing accuracy ( see Figure 5 Bottom Middle figure ) . \u201c One improvement I could suggest to better motivate the proposed approach is to experiment it not only on Convolutional-based networks with image classification tasks but also on Recurrent-based networks with text datasets. \u201d It is a great suggestion and we will do experiments on RNN and other models as well , and the initial results looking promising . \u201c At the top of page 2 , the last sentence of the top paragraph ( `` However , these learning rate schedules are insufficient ... '' ) requires a citation. \u201d From Lang et al . ( 2019 ) : `` Many former and current state-of-the art results use the constant-and-cut schedules rather than the polynomial decay schedules during training , such as those in image classification [ 1 ] , object detection [ 2 ] , machine translation [ 3 ] , and speech recognition [ 4 ] . Additionally , some recent theoretical evidence indicates that in some ( strongly convex ) scenarios , the constant-and-cut scheme has better finite-time last-iterate convergence performance than other methods [ 5 ] . '' In practice , these polynomial decay schedules sometimes work with proper tuning of the hyperparameters a , b and c. Therefore , to be rigorous , we have also changed this to \u201c these learning rate schedules still require significant hyperparameter tuning efforts in modern machine learning practice. \u201d [ 1 ] Yanping Huang , Yonglong Cheng , Dehao Chen , HyoukJoong Lee , Jiquan Ngiam , Quoc V Le , and Zhifeng Chen .

Statistical tests are presented to check the stationarity of the gradient updates. And stochastic line-search methods are proposed to warm up the optimization process during early phases. Pros: The main idea is to check the non-stationarity of the iterates and decrease the learning rate if stationarity is detected. To check stationarity, a quadratic approximation for the objective is used. Another procedure for how to decrease the learning rate is proposed using a stochastic line search. The idea makes sense to me. Cons: -- The quadratic approximation simply assumes that the Hessian matrix of the objective is identity (Equation 10 in Section 2). I appreciate the simplicity of this formulation. Indeed quadratic forms are good local approximations for any general function. On the other hand, it is quite possible that the Hessian matrix has a low-rank structure or has a sharply decaying spectrum. This kind of scenario naturally arise in high-dimensional settings where the model has lots of parameters. Therefore, it seems to me that further justification (either empirical or theoretical) could help clarify the intuition better. -- The experimental results compare the proposed method to other well-known methods such as SGD and ADAM. From Figure 1 and Figure 5, it seems that the proposed method performs comparatively to both SGD and ADAM. In particular, it is not obvious from the experimental results that there is a huge benefit obtained from the proposed methods. Hence the experimental results seem a bit incremental to me, as far as I can tell. More comments: -- Notation: using $\\xi$ to denote the data points seems a bit unconventional. -- Typos: \"Pflug also a devised\" -> \"Pflug also devised\". -- The current version is significantly over length (by more than 1 page).", "rating": "3: Weak Reject", "reply_text": "We thank Reviewer # 1 for the feedback . However , the review comments show major misunderstandings of the method and the goal of the paper , which we elaborate below . First , we do * not * make any quadratic approximation of the objective function F ( x ) . On the contrary , the advantage of our method is that it applies to all objective functions in the general stochastic optimization form given in Equation ( 1 ) , regardless of quadraticity or convexity of F ( x ) . We state clearly in the paragraph after Equation ( 10 ) on page 3 : `` This condition holds * exactly * for any stochastic optimization method of the form ( 6 ) if it reaches stationarity ... Beyond stationarity , it requires no specific assumption on the loss function or noise model for the stochastic gradients . '' In fact , a necessary and sufficient condition for stationarity is that Equation ( 8 ) holds for any test function $ \\phi $ . Here we derive a necessary condition by setting the test function to be a simple quadratic function $ \\phi ( x ) = ( 1/2 ) \\|x\\|^2 $ . If we reject any necessary condition , we reject the null hypothesis of stationarity . We could also use any other function as the testing function , including the objective function F ( x ) itself , but this can result in conditions that are very hard to check without approximation . The test function $ \\phi $ and the objective function F ( x ) do not need to be related . Using a quadratic test function leads to the simple necessary condition ( 10 ) that works exactly for any objective function F ( x ) . In addition , our master condition ( 10 ) also works for general stochastic optimization algorithm of the form ( 6 ) where the direction $ d^k $ can be the stochastic gradient , or combined with momentum , or generated by the QHM dynamics in ( 7 ) , or even more general . And the master condition ( 10 ) is still * exact * for testing ( non ) -stationarity . There is no approximation involved here either . Second , as we stated in the last part of the introduction , our proposed algorithm SALSA is a highly * autonomous * algorithm to increase/decrease its learning rate automatically , and it matches best performance of * hand-tuned methods * ( SGD and Adam ) on the two benchmark tasks in this paper . The advantage of SALSA is its automation , not necessarily achieving higher testing accuracy . In fact , for the CIFAR10 and ImageNet dataset , with fixed network architectures ( ResNet18 ) , researchers and engineers have extensively * hand-tuned * different kinds of algorithms for years to obtain the accuracy reported in this paper , which may be the limit of the ResNet18 architecture . In our experiments , SALSA robustly achieves this accuracy automatically without tuning hyperparameters . We believe such progress is beyond `` incremental . '' In addition , the line search procedure we propose ( SSLS ) tackles another major challenge of running any stochastic gradient type of method : how does one set the initial learning rate ? We have shown empirically that SSLS can start from an arbitrarily small learning rate and gradually reach a stable learning rate that matches the initial learning rate of hand-tuned schedules . Thus by combining SSLS and SASA+ , our SALSA algorithm is fully automatic in the sense that it can automatically search for a stable learning rate for the initial phase of training and then decrease it to obtain best performance . For \u201c More comments \u201d : In our paper , $ \\xi $ is not denoting the data point , but the randomness in the stochastic optimization algorithm , e.g. , mini-batch sampling in empirical risk minimization . Using $ \\xi $ to denote the per-step randomness is a standard notation for stochastic optimization ."}}
