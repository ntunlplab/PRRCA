Please let us know if our responses below address the issues raised in your review , or if any additional clarifications are needed . > Bernstein \u2019 s wide confidence interval The confidence intervals based on Bernstein \u2019 s inequality are expected to be quite conservative [ 3 ] [ 4 ] due to the generality of the inequality . Therefore , we are not surprised that the CI of Bernstein is much wider than BayesDICE . > Biased baselines and under-coverage Bernstein , Student-t , and Bootstrapping in Fig.2 of the original paper are indeed biased due to self-normalization across the entire dataset in the importance sampling estimator . It is known that self-normalization yields better empirical results in MDPs despite being biased [ 1 , 2 ] . To maintain uniformity between the MDP and bandit settings , we therefore used self-normalization in both cases . However , to understand how self-normalization affects interval coverage on bandit , we did rerun these baselines in our bandit experiments without self-normalization . The new bandit results are plotted in the updated appendix ( Figure 5 ) for Bernstein , Student-t , and Bootstrapping . As expected , Bernstein is conservative , resulting in over-coverage , Student-t makes a distributional assumption , which if violated can lead to undercoverage , and Bootstrap is asymptotic and generally undercovers for small sample sizes , as we observe . It is true that removing self-normalization can improve the coverage of these estimators in bandit settings , although normalization remains advantageous for the MDP case . We have clarified this issue in the paper . > Independence assumption of $ \\ { \\bar { \\rho } _i\\ } $ The last paragraph of Sec.3.2 of the original submission pointed out that \u201c we further assume that the distributions are independent for each policy \u201d . This assumption allows the joint distribution of policy values to be expressed as a simple product of individual policy value distributions $ q ( \\bar { \\rho } _1 , ... , \\bar { \\rho } _N ) = \\prod_i q ( \\bar { \\rho } _i ) $ , which makes computation much easier . This is a simplifying assumption that empirically works well . > Bandit environment The bandit environment is a Bernoulli bandit with binary rewards .

The benefits of BayesDICE , namely the access to the full value posterior , are particularly well-aligned with the need of the OPS problem .

Please see our response below . > I am less convinced by the motivation of off-policy model selection , since if we want to find some policy to deploy , does off-policy learning address the problem ? Off-policy learning does not completely solve the problem for several reasons : ( 1 ) Current off-policy RL algorithms can not be used out-of-the-box and require hyperparameter-tuning [ 1 ] , thus precisely necessitating some mechanism for off-policy model selection . ( 2 ) Off-policy RL algorithms learn policies to maximize expected return . As elaborated on in our submission , a practitioner may prefer a collection of policies optimized for some other metric , such as top-k precision or regret . ( 3 ) Policies in practical applications may not be amenable to ( policy ) -gradient-based ( or similar forms of ) learning . For example , policies may have a combination of business logic and hard-coded rules . In these cases , it may be easier to rank a set of candidate policies rather than learn one from scratch . > Do we need really to go though all permutations in Alg 1 ? The reviewer is right , and we agree that depending on the evaluation metric chosen , its structural properties can be exploited to nullify the need to test all permutations in Alg 1 . Such structural properties are present in many natural metrics ( such as top-k precision or regret ) and so we believe our method will easily scale to larger numbers of candidate policies . > Just curious , any explanation about why it fails in some domain , say Taxi in Fig 2 ? It could be better to discuss more about when the method works , when it fails ? Taxi in Fig 2 may be a good example to diagnose this ? Tabular Taxi [ 3 ] is a much harder environment than others in Fig.2.The environment has 2000 states in total ( 25 \u00d7 24 \u00d7 5 , corresponding to 25 taxi locations , 24 passenger appearance status and 5 taxi status ( empty or with one of 4 destinations ) ) . The large state-action space incurs additional stochasticity that results in larger estimation error in BayesDICE . > In experiments , for baseline methods , the authors are using per-step IPS +/- conf level . However , I feel it is kind of unfair for baseline methods , since basically the BayesDICE are using marginalized IPS , is it possible to change the baseline estimate to marginalized IPS for a fair comparison ? First , we note that the original frequentist approach to CI estimation uses importance reweighting without marginalization [ 2 ] . Marginalized IPS for CI estimation has not been theoretically justified , but since the reviewer raised this question , we conducted additional tabular CI experiments using marginalized IPS and present the results in the updated appendix ( Figure 6 ) . Bandit is omitted since the horizon length is $ 1 $ . We found that the baselines still have large interval width or inaccurate coverage . Our most interesting finding is that Student-t undercovers in the Taxi environment with marginalized IPS , potentially due to its distributional assumption being violated . > Can you comment how you address the stochasticity in the reward ? We restricted our analysis to deterministic reward ( footnote 1 on pg.2 ) , but the proposed method can be easily extended to stochastic reward . BayesDICE is fitting the posterior of correction ratio , which is independent w.r.t.the reward . We could fit the posterior of the reward as a simple Bayesian regression . As a result , the final accumulated reward as well as its CI can be computed by sampling from the posteriors of stationary ratio and reward . [ 1 ] Paine T.

Specifically , the authors estimate the posteriors over the correction ratios for state-action pairs , which optimize a combined metric of a chance constraint from collected data and KL from the prior . Computationally , the authors demonstrate the advantages of their approach by having better performances in both coverage and power for policy evaluation and better downstream ranking with respect to different metrics for policy selection . I think the paper is well written and has made a good investigation of their approach . It would be better if the authors can talk about how different choices of prior influence the results . Besides , for policy selection , when we have a large pool of candidates , how would this be adapted to multiple testing or how would the number of candidates influence the results .

Please see our response below . > Choice of prior . The prior of the ratio variables $ \\zeta $ is chosen to be a Gaussian distribution with $ \\mu=1 $ and $ \\sigma=1 $ . Anecdotally , we have found the confidence intervals to be robust to small perturbations ; specifically , we played with setting $ \\mu \\sim [ 0.1 , 10 ] , \\sigma \\sim [ 0.1 , 1 ] $ and observed the resulting confidence intervals to be similar to those in the paper . > Multiple testing . We assume the reviewer is asking about multiple hypothesis testing . Since the output of BayesDICE is a posterior distribution of policy values , we expect existing Bayesian frameworks for multiple testing ( e.g. , [ 1 ] ) to apply to BayesDICE . The exact procedure for conducting such tests is beyond the scope of this paper . > How the number of candidates influences the results . How the number of candidates influences the results depends on the specific policy selection criteria and the characteristics of the policies at hand . For instance , if one policy \u2019 s mean value is much larger than all the other policies \u2019 and the selection criteria is top-1 mean value estimate , additional candidate policies with small mean values will not affect the selection results . The OfflineSelect algorithm guarantees to select the \u201c best \u201d policies defined by a given selection criteria and a fixed number of policies , no matter what the selection criteria and policy characteristics are . > Independence of data samples . For mathematical simplicity , we assume that the dataset is sampled i.i.d . ( see Section 2.1 ) . This is a common assumption in the OPE literature [ 2 ] and may be relaxed in some cases by assuming a fast mixing time [ 3 ] . In practice , although the i.i.d.assumption may not hold , our empirical results show that the estimator \u2019 s accuracy is not strongly affected .

However , I feel it is kind of unfair for baseline methods , since basically the BayesDICE are using marginalized IPS , is it possible to change the baseline estimate to marginalized IPS for a fair comparison ? First , we note that the original frequentist approach to CI estimation uses importance reweighting without marginalization [ 2 ] . Marginalized IPS for CI estimation has not been theoretically justified , but since the reviewer raised this question , we conducted additional tabular CI experiments using marginalized IPS and present the results in the updated appendix ( Figure 6 ) . Bandit is omitted since the horizon length is $ 1 $ . We found that the baselines still have large interval width or inaccurate coverage . Our most interesting finding is that Student-t undercovers in the Taxi environment with marginalized IPS , potentially due to its distributional assumption being violated . > Can you comment how you address the stochasticity in the reward ? We restricted our analysis to deterministic reward ( footnote 1 on pg.2 ) , but the proposed method can be easily extended to stochastic reward . BayesDICE is fitting the posterior of correction ratio , which is independent w.r.t.the reward . We could fit the posterior of the reward as a simple Bayesian regression . As a result , the final accumulated reward as well as its CI can be computed by sampling from the posteriors of stationary ratio and reward . [ 1 ] Paine T.

Specifically , the authors estimate the posteriors over the correction ratios for state-action pairs , which optimize a combined metric of a chance constraint from collected data and KL from the prior . Computationally , the authors demonstrate the advantages of their approach by having better performances in both coverage and power for policy evaluation and better downstream ranking with respect to different metrics for policy selection . I think the paper is well written and has made a good investigation of their approach . It would be better if the authors can talk about how different choices of prior influence the results . Besides , for policy selection , when we have a large pool of candidates , how would this be adapted to multiple testing or how would the number of candidates influence the results . Finally , solving eq.14 needs estimation of some expectation over the state action visitation , while the data itself is not independent , how would this influence the results ? some minor comments - section 3.1 , the first displayed equation : should it be summing from t=0 to infinity ? - typo , appendix B , the first sentence , ` `` consider exploitin '' - > exploiting", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Thank you for appreciating the new perspective we bring to offline policy selection . Please see our response below . > Choice of prior . The prior of the ratio variables $ \\zeta $ is chosen to be a Gaussian distribution with $ \\mu=1 $ and $ \\sigma=1 $ . Anecdotally , we have found the confidence intervals to be robust to small perturbations ; specifically , we played with setting $ \\mu \\sim [ 0.1 , 10 ] , \\sigma \\sim [ 0.1 , 1 ] $ and observed the resulting confidence intervals to be similar to those in the paper . > Multiple testing . We assume the reviewer is asking about multiple hypothesis testing . Since the output of BayesDICE is a posterior distribution of policy values , we expect existing Bayesian frameworks for multiple testing ( e.g. , [ 1 ] ) to apply to BayesDICE . The exact procedure for conducting such tests is beyond the scope of this paper . > How the number of candidates influences the results . How the number of candidates influences the results depends on the specific policy selection criteria and the characteristics of the policies at hand . For instance , if one policy \u2019 s mean value is much larger than all the other policies \u2019 and the selection criteria is top-1 mean value estimate , additional candidate policies with small mean values will not affect the selection results . The OfflineSelect algorithm guarantees to select the \u201c best \u201d policies defined by a given selection criteria and a fixed number of policies , no matter what the selection criteria and policy characteristics are . > Independence of data samples . For mathematical simplicity , we assume that the dataset is sampled i.i.d . ( see Section 2.1 ) . This is a common assumption in the OPE literature [ 2 ] and may be relaxed in some cases by assuming a fast mixing time [ 3 ] . In practice , although the i.i.d.assumption may not hold , our empirical results show that the estimator \u2019 s accuracy is not strongly affected .
