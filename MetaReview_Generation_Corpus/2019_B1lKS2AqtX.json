The results on the TaxiBJ dataset (not TatxtBJ, please correct the name in the paper) are compelling, and the concerns regarding some of the text explainations have been corrected. ----- The proposed model uses a 3D-CNN with a new kind of 3D-conv. recurrent layer named E3D-LSTM, an extension of 3D-RCNN layers where the recall mechanism is extended by using an attentional mechanism, allowing it to update the recurrent state not only based on the previous state, but on a mixture of previous states from all previous time steps. Pros: The new approach displays outstanding results for future video prediction. Firstly, it obtains better results in short term predictions thanks to the 3D-Convolutional topology. Secondly, the recall mechanism is shown to be more stable over time: The prediction accuracy is sustained over longer preiods of time (longer prediction sequences) with a much smaller degradation. Regarding early action recognition, the use of future video prediction as a jointly learned auxiliary task is shown to significantly increase the prediction accuracy. The ablation study is compelling. Cons: The model does not compare against other methods regarding early action recognition. Since this is a novel field of study in computer vision, and not too much work exists on the subject, it is understandable. Also, it is not the main focus of the work. In the introduction, the authors state that they account for uncertainty by better modelling the temporal sequence. Please, remove or rephrase this part. Uncertainty in video prediction is not due to the lack of modelling ability, but due to the inherent uncertainty of the task. In real world scenarios (eg. the KTH dataset used here) there is a continuous space of possible futures. In the case of variational models, this is captured as a distribution from which to sample. Adversarial models collapse this space into a single future in order to create more realistic-looking predictions. I don't believe your approach should necessarily model that space (after all, the novelty is on better modelling the sequence itself, not the possible futures, and the model can be easily extended to do so, either through GANs or VAEs), but it is important to not mislead the reader. It would have been interesting to analyse the work on more complex settings, such as UCF101. While KTH is already a real-world dataset, its variability is very limited: A small set of backgrounds and actions, performed by a small group of individuals.

The main idea of this paper is to get the best world of both in a unified way. The method first encodes a sequence of frames using 3D-conv to capture short-term motion patterns, passes it to a specific type of LSTM (E3D-LSTM) which accepts spatiotemporal feature maps as input. E3D-LSTM captures long-term dependencies using an attention mechanism. Finally, there are 3D-conv based decoders which receive the output of E3D-LSTM and generate future frames. The message of the paper, I believe, is that 3D-conv and RNNs can be integrated to perform short and long predictions. They show in the experiments how the model can remember far past for reasoning and prediction. The nice point of the method is that it is heavily investigated through experiments. It's evaluated on two datasets, with ablation studies on both. Moreover, the paper is well-written and clear. technically, the paper seems correct. However, my only big concern is about the limited novelty of the method. E3D-LSTM is the core of the novelty, which is basically an LSTM with extra gate, and attention mechanism. other comments: - As the method by essence is a spatiotemporal learning model, why the method is not evaluated on full-length videos of the something-something dataset for classical action classification task, in order to compare it with the full architecture of I3D, or S3D? - While the paper discusses self-supervised learning, I would suggest showing its benefit on online action recognition task.

E3D-LSTM is the core of the novelty , which is basically an LSTM with extra gate , and attention mechanism . The concern on limited novelty is mainly due to the seeming similarity to the prior work [ Wang et al. , 2017 ] . Below we clarify the differences to the prior work : 1 . Our paper is one of , if not the first , work to systematically explore 3D convolutions * * inside * * the RNN . More importantly , it is the first to show a carefully designed method achieves the state-of-the-art results on several public benchmarks . The improvements are otherwise not shown for any known combination of 3D convolutions and RNN . 2.Our technical difference to the existing work includes : a. we study where to apply the 3D info . For example , combine 2D or 3D inputs ( see Figure 1 ) , inflate the LSTM cell to 3D ( see Figure 2b ) , or separate the 3D convolutions in the input and LSTM cell ( see Table 4 ) . b. we propose how to effectively embed the 3D convolution inside the LSTM ( i.e.we introduce a new recall gate in Equation 1 for the 3D-memory transition inside the LSTM ) . Among the recent advances in deep learning , many great models appear to be similar to prior work ( e.g.ResNet and Highway Network , ConvLSTM and LSTM , C3D/I3D CNN and 2D CNN ) . However , it is not true as the devil is in the important details . Similarly , we build upon prior work , make only necessary , yet important , model designs , and validate the necessities with ablation studies to demonstrate their merits . Our designs are driven by a clear motivation , innovative thinkings , and validated by extensive experiments ( as agreed by all reviewers ) . We hope this can resolve the concern on novelty . Q4 : As the method by essence is a spatiotemporal learning model , why the method is not evaluated on full-length videos of the something-something dataset ? The main reason is that predicting on the full-length video may not align well with our topic . A typical video classification model which can see full-length videos may make decisions mainly depending on the scene information . As shown in Fig.5 , suppose the tasks is to predict a category \u201c Poking a stack of [ Something ] , so the stack collapses \u201d . The problem would be very simple as long as the model sees the last frame which shows the outcome of the action . In contrast , the early activity recognition task makes the model have no other choices but to depend on an inference of the action intentions when making decisions . It aligns well with the video prediction task , in which the sequential tendency and causality are important . We notice that it would be more accurate to claim our model as a spatiotemporal predictive learning model , rather than a broad \u201c spatiotemporal learning model \u201d . We have revised that in the paper . Q5 : Show the benefit on online action recognition task . As suggested , we have added online early activity recognition by making the classifier only depend on a concatenation of the recurrent outputs regarding the last 5 timestamps . As such , the historical recurrent states are only kept for 5 timestamps and then discarded . In particular , we apply a sliding window of limited length to the inputs of the Recall gate , using $ C_ { t-5 : t-1 } $ instead of $ C_ { 1 : t-1 } $ in Eq.1.Experimental results are shown in Table 7 . Despite the slightly decreased accuracy , applying the sliding window on the Recall gate improves the scalability of E3D-LSTM . Q6 : How was the process of selecting 41 classes out of the something-something dataset ? In the original paper [ Goyal et al.2017 ] of the Something-Something dataset , the 41 classes ( in Table 7 ) are listed as a standard and official dataset setting . This split contains 56k video clips for training and 7.5k for validation and is large enough and meanwhile computational convenient to compare a variety of baseline methods . We have clarified this point in the paper ( Page 9 ) ."}, {"review_id": "B1lKS2AqtX-2", "review_text": "# 1. Summary This paper presents a model for future video prediction, which integrates 3D convolutions into RNNs. The internal operations of the RNN are modified by adding historical records controlled via a gate-controlled self-attention module.

Clarity and Motivation In general, the paper is clear and general motivation makes sense, however some points need to be improved with further discussion and motivation: A) Page 2 \u201cUnlike the conventional memory transition function, it learns the size of temporal interactions. For longer sequences, this allows attending to distant states containing salient information\u201d: This is not obvious. Can the authors add more details and motivate these two sentences?

B) Page 5 \u201cThese two terms are respectively designed for short-term and long-term video modeling\u201d: How do you make sure that Recall(.) does not focus on the short-term modeling instead? Not clear why this should model long-term relations. C) Page 5 and Eq 1: motivation why layer norm is required when defining C_t^k is not clear D) What if the Recall is instead modeled as attention? The idea is to consider only C_{1:t-1}^k (not consider R_t) and have an attentional model that learn what to recall based only on C. Also, why does Recall need to depend on R_t? E) Page 5 \u201cto minimize the l1 + l2 loss over every pixel in the frame\u201d: this sentence is not clear. How does it relate to Eq. 2? # 3. Novelty Novelty is the major concern of this paper. Although the introduced new concepts and ideas are interesting, the work seems to be an extension of ST-LSTM and PredRNN where Eq 1 is slightly modified by introducing Recall. In addition the existing relation between the proposed model and ST-LSTM is not clearly state. Page 2, first paragraph: here the authors should state that model is and extension of ST-LSTM and highlight what are the difference and advantage of the new model. # 4. Significance of the work This paper deals with an interesting and challenging topic (video prediction) as well as it shows some results on the early activity recognition task. These are definitively nice problem which are far to be solved. From the application perspective this work is significant, however from the methodological perspective it lacks a bit of significance because of the novelty issues highlighted above. # 5. Experimentation The experiments are robust with nice comparisons with recent methods and ablation study motivating the different components of the model (Table 1 and 2). Some suggested improvements: A) Page 7 \u201cSeq 1 and Seq 2 are completely irrelevant, and ahead of them, another sub-sequence called prior context is given as the input, which is exactly the same as Seq 2\u201d: The COPY task is a bit unclear and need to be better explained. Why are Seq. 1 and 2 irrelevant? I would suggest to rephrase this part. B) Sec. 4.2, \u201cDataset and setup\u201d: which architecture has been used here? C) Sec. 4.3, \u201cHyper-parameters and Baselines\u201c: the something-something dataset is more realising that the other two \u201ctoy\u201d dataset. Why did the authors choose to train a 2 layers 3D-CNN encoders, instead of using existing pretrained 3D CNNs? I would suspect that the results can improve quite a bit. # 6.

I\u2019d suggest to either remove it or explain its meaning. * Figure 1(a): inconsistent notation with 2b. Also add citation (Wang et al., 2017) since it ie the same model of that paper ------- # Post-discussion I increased my rating: even if novelty is not high, the results support the incremental ideas proposed by the authors.

How long-term relations are learned given Eq.1 ? > > Different from standard LSTMs , we are motivated by modeling the long-term relations across frames . The long-term relations are learned by the RECALL function in Eq.1 , whose inputs are the historical memory states C_ { t-\\tau : t-1 } ^k ( in particular , we use C_ { 1 : t-1 } ^k for most experiments in this work ) .

More specifically , in Eq.1 , C_ { t-1 } ^k is added to C_t^k via a short-cut connection controlled by the forget gate . Intuitively , it conveys short-term information , thus allowing the RECALL function to focus on long-term relations . Empirically , the COPY task verifies that our model could make use of information from the distant memory states when future predictions are severely dependent on the distant past .

Thus , we encode X_t and H_ { t-1 } ^k into R_t , and use it as the query of the attentive RECALL function .

Why are Seq.1 and Seq.2 irrelevant ? > > We have rephrased this part in Page 6 . Basically , the COPY task is to evaluate whether our model could recall useful information from the distant memory states . A well-performed predictive model should make precise predictions regarding Seq 2 , as it has seen all frames of this sequence before . But this task is difficult for previous LSTM networks . Because the Seq 1 is totally irrelevant , making predictions of Seq 1 will erase its memory of Seq 2 .

Why did the authors choose to train a 2 layers 3D-CNN encoders , instead of using existing pretrained 3D CNNs ? > > In this paper , our goal is to explore a generic method that can infer the action tendency and intentions from sequential video frames . We show that in a fair setting ( the same training set and similar # learnable parameters ) , the improvements of our work come from a better model to capture and predict low-level video data trends , along with a better understanding of high-level actions . Although using the 3D-CNN model pre-trained on video datasets may improve the results , it also makes fair comparisons among all methods very tricky . First , suppose a model improves the results ; it is less clear whether it is because the model learns a better representation on the pretrained data , or it is actually better in modeling the target dataset . Second , due to the domain difference , it is hard to select which pretrained models ( e.g.Sports1M or Kinetics ) to use on which dataset , and the pretrained model works on one dataset ( e.g.something-something ) may not work well on another dataset ( e.g.KTH ) .These issues can result in a lengthy and unclear experimental section ."}}
