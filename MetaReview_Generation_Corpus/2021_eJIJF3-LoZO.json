This intermediate space is then used for few-shot learning instead of using only the input space . This leads to better classification performance on the task , and it shows that injecting human-interpretable structured representation into task correlates with better performance ( as one would hope ) . The paper uses datasets from different domains and shows improvement over approaches that don \u2019 t use the above defined \u201c concepts \u201d . Strengths - Paper is well-written - Approach is tested on different dataset domains - Experiments , ablation and qualitative results verify the claims of the paper Weaknesses - Figure 3 ( Right ) - In CUB you mentioned that not all 15 part-based annotations are available for every image ( ref.Section 3.1 - Datasets ) . Does that mean there is a non-uniform distribution of part annotations per class ? If this is the case , should it be taken into account for Figure 3 ( Right ) ? It could be that beak is important for most of the classes simply because it was present more often that the other parts . - Fine-grained classification only ? - If I understood correctly , you need concepts ( or part-based annotations ) to be consistently present in all input images and all classes , because if they are not and the distribution of concepts is heavily skewed towards a subset of classes , then your approach won \u2019 t be effective . Does that mean that your approach is only effective for fine-grained classification datasets ? Can mini-ImageNet or Omniglot be candidates for testing ?

Can you appropriately mention these facts and/or cite the papers where you picked numbers from in Table 1 ? - It was a bit surprising to see MAML underperforming in comparison to all the baselines ( including Finetune ) Preliminary Rating and its justification I see no obvious issues with the paper .

To investigate this question , we checked the frequency of top ranked concepts and found that they all have similar frequency ( 5206-5860 ) . The lowest frequency ( 5206 ) has a \u201c belly \u201d concept ; however it is ranked as the second most important concept . * RE : Does that mean that your approach is only effective for fine-grained classification datasets ? Can mini-ImageNet or Omniglot be candidates for testing ? * We thank the reviewer for this question and for understanding the paper correctly . In the computer vision domain , we consider fine-grained image classification since we can easily automatically extract concepts using landmark detection methods . Automatic concept extraction is more challenging on the mini-ImageNet and opens other research questions . In general , COMET can be applicable if at least one concept is shared between meta-train and meta-test datasets . Omniglot can be a candidate dataset , but since most methods achieve near-perfect performance , recent methods are not using it as a benchmark dataset anymore . * RE : Are the methods reimplemented or you cited results from papers ? Can you appropriately mention these facts and/or cite the papers where you picked numbers from in Table 1 ? * For most baselines ( MAML , ProtoNet , RelationNet , MatchingNet , FineTune ) we built our codebase based on the implementation provided by Chen , et al.Closer Look at the Few-shot Classification ( https : //github.com/wyharveychen/CloserLookFewShot ) . For MetaOptNet and DeepEMD we used implementations from the respective papers . We rerun all methods in our codebase . We will make all code publicly available to the community , as well as contribute with the new benchmark datasets . We can also provide a private link to our codebase if needed . * RE : It was a bit surprising to see MAML underperforming in comparison to all the baselines ( including Finetune ) * We thank the reviewer for the careful observation . We did not change MAML implementation in any manner . On the CUB dataset , the only difference compared to the Closer Look at the Few-shot Classification paper by Cheng et al.is in the implementation of data augmentation . We used our own implementation but it is consistent across all experiments ."}, {"review_id": "eJIJF3-LoZO-2", "review_text": "This paper proposes concept learners to effectively combines the outputs of independent concept learners . The model is evaluated on several datasets from different domains . First of all , why the authors define it as generalizable few-shot learning , the settings targeted in this paper seem to do no different from traditional few-shot learning . Why is it called generalizable few-shot learning ? The other two main concerns are : The idea of learning to attend different segments of an image or learning to the segment has been proposed in previous literature [ a , b , c , d ] . Even if they are not specifically targeted on a few-shot image classification , the proposed concept learners are still pretty similar to previous works and are not specifically designed for few-shot image classification tasks . Thus , I believe the novelty is somewhat limited for this submission . In experiments , even if the authors choose three datasets for comparisons . I am more interested in results on standard benchmarks , such as miniImageNet , tieredImageNet . The results on the current datasets are not a convincing performance in my point of view . It is expected to see experiments on more standard and large-scaled datasets . A minor point I am curious about is that by simple data augmentation method : crop , is it possible that multiple random cropping can generate different concepts and achieve similar effects by simply cropping multiple times on one image ?

Our work is motivated by the way human knowledge is structured in the form of reusable concepts that help us to generalize to unseen tasks . The goal in our work is to show that introducing such structure in meta-learners improves generalization ability , as supported by our experiments . The setting is not different from other few-shot learning methods , but our key idea of transferable concepts results in significantly improved generalization ability over the existing few-shot learning methods . We agree with the reviewer that the proposed title may be misleading . We removed the word \u201c generalizable \u201d from the title as suggested by the reviewer . * RE : The idea of learning to attend different segments of an image or learning to the segment has been proposed in previous literature [ a , b , c , d ] . Thus , I believe the novelty is somewhat limited for this submission . * We thank the reviewer for the references . However , the referenced works are introducing attention-mechanism into convolutional architecture in order to learn to attend over different image regions . This differs greatly from the approach proposed in our work in the number of aspects . First , we are not introducing attention mechanisms in the network , but relying on the high-level human-understandable concepts . Next , the key idea in our work is that combining diverse and independent concept learners defined in concept-specific metric spaces helps us to generalize better in the few-shot scenario . In contrast , references [ a-d ] learn only one metric space with more discriminative features obtained with the attention mechanism . Finally , all these works are focused on learning to attend on image classification tasks ; while our approach is domain-agnostic and can be effectively applied in diverse domains providing also interpretations behind predictions , as demonstrated in our experiments . In response to the reviewer \u2019 s feedback , we have included [ c , d ] in the related work . * RE : In experiments , even if the authors choose three datasets for comparisons . I am more interested in results on standard benchmarks , such as miniImageNet , tieredImageNet . The results on the current datasets are not a convincing performance in my point of view . * We thank the reviewer for the question and we would just like to correct that we evaluate performance on four datasets in three domains . In the computer vision domain , we evaluate performance on CUB and Flowers datasets which are standard benchmarks for fine-grained image classification tasks . Reference [ c ] suggested by the reviewer considers a few-shot classification only in the fine-grained image recognition task . As emphasized in [ c ] , fine-grained image recognition is more difficult than general image recognition due to the subtle and local differences . Fine-grained image classification allows us to automatically extract concepts easily . On general image classification task automatic concept extraction opens other research questions that are out of scope of this work . We would like to emphasize that unlike previous methods which were focused on benchmarking on image datasets , our method is domain-agnostic and broadens the applicability of few-shot learning to other domains . Reuters is a standard benchmark for text classification , while in the biology domain we contribute to the community with the new dataset and conduct the first systematic evaluation of meta-learning methods . * RE : By simple data augmentation method : crop , is it possible that multiple random cropping can generate different concepts and achieve similar effects by simply cropping multiple times on one image ? * We thank the reviewer for the question , but this is not possible . Random crops would not be transferable across images . Concepts are defined as meaningful object structures that appear across domains and tasks ."}, {"review_id": "eJIJF3-LoZO-3", "review_text": "* * Overview * * Inspired by DeepEMD 's obersvation that compositional representations generalize better for few-shot image classification , this paper ( COMET ) introduces `` Concepts Embeddings '' components to the Prototypical Networks . `` Concepts Embeddings '' are part-based representations and are learnt by a set of independent networks $ \\\\ { f_ { \\theta_i } \\\\ } $ ( can also share weights ) . For each novel class , its $ N $ concept prototypes are computed using the support set , and a query example is classified by measuring its distances to each novel class 's $ N $ concept prototypes . Evaluations and experiments are carried out on 3 datasets : CUB , Tabula Muris and Reuters . The proposed COMET approach obtains favorable performances on all 3 datasets . * * Pros * * This work explore ways to learn compositional representations in a semi-supervised fashion . It takes Prototypical Networks as baseline and adds a novel `` Concept Embedding '' component . The authors show the proposed approach can significantly improve ProtoNet baseline on 3 datasets . It also outperforms the recent approach DeepEMD . The following observation on the CUB dataset is very interesting : `` Strikingly , by adding just one most frequent concept corresponding to a bird \u2019 s beak on top of the whole image concept , we improve ProtoNet \u2019 s performance on CUB by 10 % and 5 % in 1-shot and 5-shot tasks , respectively . '' * * Cons * * Using multiple prototypes per class has been explored in `` Infinite Mixture Prototypes for Few-shot Learning '' ( ICML'19 ) , maybe the authors should mention it and highlight differences . It 's unclear where does $ C $ comes from by just reading section 2.2 . How to compute $ C $ is later elaborated in experiments section 3.1 . Essentially $ C $ are hand-crafted for each dataset . Maybe the authors should hint this in section 2.2 . The math symbols are a bit confusing in section 2.2 . For instance , inconsistent notation $ f_ { \\theta } ^ { ( j ) } $ in section 2.2 and $ f_ { \\theta_j } $ in Figure 1 , also $ D $ 's definition is not given ( is it equal to the number of pixels $ \\times $ number of input channel ? ) . I appreciate the authors provinding many interesting ablation studies , but the main evaluation ( Table 1 ) misses 2 important image few-shot classification dataset/benchmarks : miniImageNet , and MetaDataset . How does the COMET with `` Unsupervised concept annotation '' performs on the above two datasets ? When compared with ensemble , why specifically 5 ProtoNets ? How many concepts are used in COMET and COMET ( shared weight ) ? This ablation should be included in main paper , as network capacity can improve accuracy significantly , see : `` A Closer Look at Few-shot Classification '' ( ICLR'19 ) . * * Reason for the decision * * This paper explores using compositional representations in Prototypical Networks . The authors introduce a novel concept embeddings idea , and show that it can significantly improve ProtoNet baseline on 3 datasets . However using multiple prototypes per class is not a new idea and the authors should highlight the differences with prior works ( what 's the strength of this particular formulation ? ) . For the evaluation , I highly suggest the authors to include standard mini-ImageNet and Meta-Dataset FSL image classification benchmarks and report performances on them . I find the following observation on the CUB dataset very interesting : `` Strikingly , by adding just one most frequent concept corresponding to a bird \u2019 s beak on top of the whole image concept , we improve ProtoNet \u2019 s performance on CUB by 10 % and 5 % in 1-shot and 5-shot tasks , respectively . '' That means human-validate concepts are complimentary to the representations learnt by a 4-layer network , but how about using a deep/stronger backbone , would it narrow the margin ? I suggest the authors add this ablation study : How much does adding a concept help w.r.t to the depth of the backbone .", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We thank the reviewer for a very valuable feedback that helped us to improve the paper .

Infinite Mixture Prototypes ( IMP ) learns multiple prototypes per class ; however , these prototypes are defined in the same metric space and obtained by clustering the support set into class-wise means . In contrast , COMET defines concept-specific metric spaces and each prototype reflects class-level differences in the metric space of the corresponding concept . The strength of COMET \u2019 s particular formulation lies in combining diverse concept-specific embedding functions which improves generalization ability . Additionally , since prototypes are defined along human-interpretable dimensions , COMET \u2019 s predictions are interpretable in contrast to IMP . In response to the reviewer \u2019 s feedback , we have included IMP in the related work and highlighted differences . * RE : It 's unclear where does C comes from by just reading section 2.2 .

We have revised the notation in the Figure 1 to be consistent with the notation in section 2.2 . Additionally , we have defined D as the number of dimensions .

This ablation should be included in main paper . * We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment . On the CUB dataset , we use 15 concepts and we always share weights between concept learners . The reason behind 5 ProtoNets is that training an ensemble of a larger number of ProtoNets on CUB results in memory issues due to the unshared weights . On the Tabula Muris dataset we use 190 concepts , and on Reuters 126 concepts . When comparing performance on these datasets , we use the same number of ProtoNets as the number of concepts , that is 190 and 126 ProtoNets . We have moved this ablation study to the main paper as suggested by the reviewer . * RE : How about using a deep/stronger backbone , would it narrow the margin ? I suggest the authors add this ablation study : How much does adding a concept help w.r.t to the depth of the backbone . * We thank the reviewer for this important question . Based on the reviewer \u2019 s feedback , we have tested COMET as well as other baselines with the Conv-6 instead of Conv-4 backbone . With Conv-6 backbone , COMET achieves 8 % improvement over DeepEMD as the best baseline method and 8.7 % improvement over ProtoNet on the 1-shot task . On the 5-shot task , COMET achieves 4.5 % and 6.8 % improvements over DeepEMD and ProtoNet , respectively . These results confirm effectiveness of COMET even with the deeper backbone network . Additionally , we have tested the improvements of adding only one concept in COMET with the Conv-6 backbone . Adding just the \u201c beak \u201d concept improves ProtoNet \u2019 s performance by 3.8 % on 1-shot task and 2.2 % on 5-shot task . We have included these results in Table 5 in Appendix C titled Ablation study on backbone network .

We have included these results in Table 7 in Appendix E and we thank the reviewer for suggesting this interesting experiment which helped to improve the paper ."}, "1": {"review_id": "eJIJF3-LoZO-1", "review_text": "Summary This paper introduces potential use of intermediate structured representation of input space called \u201c concepts \u201d which are most likely human-interpretable . This intermediate space is then used for few-shot learning instead of using only the input space . This leads to better classification performance on the task , and it shows that injecting human-interpretable structured representation into task correlates with better performance ( as one would hope ) . The paper uses datasets from different domains and shows improvement over approaches that don \u2019 t use the above defined \u201c concepts \u201d . Strengths - Paper is well-written - Approach is tested on different dataset domains - Experiments , ablation and qualitative results verify the claims of the paper Weaknesses - Figure 3 ( Right ) - In CUB you mentioned that not all 15 part-based annotations are available for every image ( ref.Section 3.1 - Datasets ) . Does that mean there is a non-uniform distribution of part annotations per class ? If this is the case , should it be taken into account for Figure 3 ( Right ) ? It could be that beak is important for most of the classes simply because it was present more often that the other parts . - Fine-grained classification only ? - If I understood correctly , you need concepts ( or part-based annotations ) to be consistently present in all input images and all classes , because if they are not and the distribution of concepts is heavily skewed towards a subset of classes , then your approach won \u2019 t be effective . Does that mean that your approach is only effective for fine-grained classification datasets ? Can mini-ImageNet or Omniglot be candidates for testing ? Minor concerns ( suggestions , typos , etc . ) - Table 1 - Are the methods reimplemented or you cited results from papers ? Can you appropriately mention these facts and/or cite the papers where you picked numbers from in Table 1 ? - It was a bit surprising to see MAML underperforming in comparison to all the baselines ( including Finetune ) Preliminary Rating and its justification I see no obvious issues with the paper .

To investigate this question , we checked the frequency of top ranked concepts and found that they all have similar frequency ( 5206-5860 ) . The lowest frequency ( 5206 ) has a \u201c belly \u201d concept ; however it is ranked as the second most important concept . * RE : Does that mean that your approach is only effective for fine-grained classification datasets ? Can mini-ImageNet or Omniglot be candidates for testing ? * We thank the reviewer for this question and for understanding the paper correctly . In the computer vision domain , we consider fine-grained image classification since we can easily automatically extract concepts using landmark detection methods . Automatic concept extraction is more challenging on the mini-ImageNet and opens other research questions . In general , COMET can be applicable if at least one concept is shared between meta-train and meta-test datasets . Omniglot can be a candidate dataset , but since most methods achieve near-perfect performance , recent methods are not using it as a benchmark dataset anymore . * RE : Are the methods reimplemented or you cited results from papers ? Can you appropriately mention these facts and/or cite the papers where you picked numbers from in Table 1 ? * For most baselines ( MAML , ProtoNet , RelationNet , MatchingNet , FineTune ) we built our codebase based on the implementation provided by Chen , et al.Closer Look at the Few-shot Classification ( https : //github.com/wyharveychen/CloserLookFewShot ) . For MetaOptNet and DeepEMD we used implementations from the respective papers . We rerun all methods in our codebase . We will make all code publicly available to the community , as well as contribute with the new benchmark datasets . We can also provide a private link to our codebase if needed . * RE : It was a bit surprising to see MAML underperforming in comparison to all the baselines ( including Finetune ) * We thank the reviewer for the careful observation . We did not change MAML implementation in any manner . On the CUB dataset , the only difference compared to the Closer Look at the Few-shot Classification paper by Cheng et al.is in the implementation of data augmentation . We used our own implementation but it is consistent across all experiments ."}, "2": {"review_id": "eJIJF3-LoZO-2", "review_text": "This paper proposes concept learners to effectively combines the outputs of independent concept learners . The model is evaluated on several datasets from different domains . First of all , why the authors define it as generalizable few-shot learning , the settings targeted in this paper seem to do no different from traditional few-shot learning . Why is it called generalizable few-shot learning ? The other two main concerns are : The idea of learning to attend different segments of an image or learning to the segment has been proposed in previous literature [ a , b , c , d ] . Even if they are not specifically targeted on a few-shot image classification , the proposed concept learners are still pretty similar to previous works and are not specifically designed for few-shot image classification tasks . Thus , I believe the novelty is somewhat limited for this submission . In experiments , even if the authors choose three datasets for comparisons . I am more interested in results on standard benchmarks , such as miniImageNet , tieredImageNet . The results on the current datasets are not a convincing performance in my point of view . It is expected to see experiments on more standard and large-scaled datasets . A minor point I am curious about is that by simple data augmentation method : crop , is it possible that multiple random cropping can generate different concepts and achieve similar effects by simply cropping multiple times on one image ?

Our work is motivated by the way human knowledge is structured in the form of reusable concepts that help us to generalize to unseen tasks . The goal in our work is to show that introducing such structure in meta-learners improves generalization ability , as supported by our experiments . The setting is not different from other few-shot learning methods , but our key idea of transferable concepts results in significantly improved generalization ability over the existing few-shot learning methods . We agree with the reviewer that the proposed title may be misleading . We removed the word \u201c generalizable \u201d from the title as suggested by the reviewer . * RE : The idea of learning to attend different segments of an image or learning to the segment has been proposed in previous literature [ a , b , c , d ] . Thus , I believe the novelty is somewhat limited for this submission . * We thank the reviewer for the references . However , the referenced works are introducing attention-mechanism into convolutional architecture in order to learn to attend over different image regions . This differs greatly from the approach proposed in our work in the number of aspects . First , we are not introducing attention mechanisms in the network , but relying on the high-level human-understandable concepts . Next , the key idea in our work is that combining diverse and independent concept learners defined in concept-specific metric spaces helps us to generalize better in the few-shot scenario . In contrast , references [ a-d ] learn only one metric space with more discriminative features obtained with the attention mechanism . Finally , all these works are focused on learning to attend on image classification tasks ; while our approach is domain-agnostic and can be effectively applied in diverse domains providing also interpretations behind predictions , as demonstrated in our experiments . In response to the reviewer \u2019 s feedback , we have included [ c , d ] in the related work . * RE : In experiments , even if the authors choose three datasets for comparisons . I am more interested in results on standard benchmarks , such as miniImageNet , tieredImageNet . The results on the current datasets are not a convincing performance in my point of view . * We thank the reviewer for the question and we would just like to correct that we evaluate performance on four datasets in three domains . In the computer vision domain , we evaluate performance on CUB and Flowers datasets which are standard benchmarks for fine-grained image classification tasks . Reference [ c ] suggested by the reviewer considers a few-shot classification only in the fine-grained image recognition task . As emphasized in [ c ] , fine-grained image recognition is more difficult than general image recognition due to the subtle and local differences . Fine-grained image classification allows us to automatically extract concepts easily . On general image classification task automatic concept extraction opens other research questions that are out of scope of this work . We would like to emphasize that unlike previous methods which were focused on benchmarking on image datasets , our method is domain-agnostic and broadens the applicability of few-shot learning to other domains . Reuters is a standard benchmark for text classification , while in the biology domain we contribute to the community with the new dataset and conduct the first systematic evaluation of meta-learning methods . * RE : By simple data augmentation method : crop , is it possible that multiple random cropping can generate different concepts and achieve similar effects by simply cropping multiple times on one image ? * We thank the reviewer for the question , but this is not possible . Random crops would not be transferable across images . Concepts are defined as meaningful object structures that appear across domains and tasks ."}, "3": {"review_id": "eJIJF3-LoZO-3", "review_text": "* * Overview * * Inspired by DeepEMD 's obersvation that compositional representations generalize better for few-shot image classification , this paper ( COMET ) introduces `` Concepts Embeddings '' components to the Prototypical Networks . `` Concepts Embeddings '' are part-based representations and are learnt by a set of independent networks $ \\\\ { f_ { \\theta_i } \\\\ } $ ( can also share weights ) . For each novel class , its $ N $ concept prototypes are computed using the support set , and a query example is classified by measuring its distances to each novel class 's $ N $ concept prototypes . Evaluations and experiments are carried out on 3 datasets : CUB , Tabula Muris and Reuters . The proposed COMET approach obtains favorable performances on all 3 datasets . * * Pros * * This work explore ways to learn compositional representations in a semi-supervised fashion . It takes Prototypical Networks as baseline and adds a novel `` Concept Embedding '' component . The authors show the proposed approach can significantly improve ProtoNet baseline on 3 datasets . It also outperforms the recent approach DeepEMD . The following observation on the CUB dataset is very interesting : `` Strikingly , by adding just one most frequent concept corresponding to a bird \u2019 s beak on top of the whole image concept , we improve ProtoNet \u2019 s performance on CUB by 10 % and 5 % in 1-shot and 5-shot tasks , respectively . '' * * Cons * * Using multiple prototypes per class has been explored in `` Infinite Mixture Prototypes for Few-shot Learning '' ( ICML'19 ) , maybe the authors should mention it and highlight differences . It 's unclear where does $ C $ comes from by just reading section 2.2 . How to compute $ C $ is later elaborated in experiments section 3.1 . Essentially $ C $ are hand-crafted for each dataset . Maybe the authors should hint this in section 2.2 . The math symbols are a bit confusing in section 2.2 . For instance , inconsistent notation $ f_ { \\theta } ^ { ( j ) } $ in section 2.2 and $ f_ { \\theta_j } $ in Figure 1 , also $ D $ 's definition is not given ( is it equal to the number of pixels $ \\times $ number of input channel ? ) . I appreciate the authors provinding many interesting ablation studies , but the main evaluation ( Table 1 ) misses 2 important image few-shot classification dataset/benchmarks : miniImageNet , and MetaDataset . How does the COMET with `` Unsupervised concept annotation '' performs on the above two datasets ? When compared with ensemble , why specifically 5 ProtoNets ? How many concepts are used in COMET and COMET ( shared weight ) ? This ablation should be included in main paper , as network capacity can improve accuracy significantly , see : `` A Closer Look at Few-shot Classification '' ( ICLR'19 ) . * * Reason for the decision * * This paper explores using compositional representations in Prototypical Networks . The authors introduce a novel concept embeddings idea , and show that it can significantly improve ProtoNet baseline on 3 datasets . However using multiple prototypes per class is not a new idea and the authors should highlight the differences with prior works ( what 's the strength of this particular formulation ? ) . For the evaluation , I highly suggest the authors to include standard mini-ImageNet and Meta-Dataset FSL image classification benchmarks and report performances on them . I find the following observation on the CUB dataset very interesting : `` Strikingly , by adding just one most frequent concept corresponding to a bird \u2019 s beak on top of the whole image concept , we improve ProtoNet \u2019 s performance on CUB by 10 % and 5 % in 1-shot and 5-shot tasks , respectively . '' That means human-validate concepts are complimentary to the representations learnt by a 4-layer network , but how about using a deep/stronger backbone , would it narrow the margin ? I suggest the authors add this ablation study : How much does adding a concept help w.r.t to the depth of the backbone .", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We thank the reviewer for a very valuable feedback that helped us to improve the paper . We have conducted additional experiments and included results of the new experiments as well as other reviewer \u2019 s suggestions in the revised paper . * RE : Using multiple prototypes per class has been explored in `` Infinite Mixture Prototypes for Few-shot Learning '' ( ICML'19 ) , maybe the authors should mention it and highlight differences . * We thank the reviewer for the relevant reference . Infinite Mixture Prototypes ( IMP ) learns multiple prototypes per class ; however , these prototypes are defined in the same metric space and obtained by clustering the support set into class-wise means . In contrast , COMET defines concept-specific metric spaces and each prototype reflects class-level differences in the metric space of the corresponding concept . The strength of COMET \u2019 s particular formulation lies in combining diverse concept-specific embedding functions which improves generalization ability . Additionally , since prototypes are defined along human-interpretable dimensions , COMET \u2019 s predictions are interpretable in contrast to IMP . In response to the reviewer \u2019 s feedback , we have included IMP in the related work and highlighted differences . * RE : It 's unclear where does C comes from by just reading section 2.2 . Essentially C are hand-crafted for each dataset . Maybe the authors should hint this in section 2.2 . * The reviewer is correct that we assume that concepts C are given as a prior knowledge . We have revised the text as suggested by the reviewer . * RE : For instance , inconsistent notation f\u03b8 ( j ) in section 2.2 and f\u03b8j in Figure 1 , also D 's definition is not given ( is it equal to the number of pixels \u00d7number of input channel ? ) . * We thank the reviewer for this great observation and checking our paper carefully . We have revised the notation in the Figure 1 to be consistent with the notation in section 2.2 . Additionally , we have defined D as the number of dimensions . In the image-classification task , D corresponds to the number of pixels \u00d7number of input channels . * RE : How does the COMET with `` Unsupervised concept annotation '' performs on the above miniImageNet , and MetaDataset datasets ? * We thank the reviewer for the question . In this work we focus on the fine-grained image classification tasks . This allows us to easily automatically extract concepts . Automatic concept extraction on datasets such as miniImageNet and MetaDataset opens other research questions that are out of scope of this work . We leave this for the future work . * RE : Why specifically 5 ProtoNets ? How many concepts are used in COMET and COMET ( shared weight ) ? This ablation should be included in main paper . * We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment . On the CUB dataset , we use 15 concepts and we always share weights between concept learners . The reason behind 5 ProtoNets is that training an ensemble of a larger number of ProtoNets on CUB results in memory issues due to the unshared weights . On the Tabula Muris dataset we use 190 concepts , and on Reuters 126 concepts . When comparing performance on these datasets , we use the same number of ProtoNets as the number of concepts , that is 190 and 126 ProtoNets . We have moved this ablation study to the main paper as suggested by the reviewer . * RE : How about using a deep/stronger backbone , would it narrow the margin ? I suggest the authors add this ablation study : How much does adding a concept help w.r.t to the depth of the backbone . * We thank the reviewer for this important question . Based on the reviewer \u2019 s feedback , we have tested COMET as well as other baselines with the Conv-6 instead of Conv-4 backbone . With Conv-6 backbone , COMET achieves 8 % improvement over DeepEMD as the best baseline method and 8.7 % improvement over ProtoNet on the 1-shot task . On the 5-shot task , COMET achieves 4.5 % and 6.8 % improvements over DeepEMD and ProtoNet , respectively . These results confirm effectiveness of COMET even with the deeper backbone network . Additionally , we have tested the improvements of adding only one concept in COMET with the Conv-6 backbone . Adding just the \u201c beak \u201d concept improves ProtoNet \u2019 s performance by 3.8 % on 1-shot task and 2.2 % on 5-shot task . We have included these results in Table 5 in Appendix C titled Ablation study on backbone network . We thank the reviewer for suggesting this experiment ."}}
