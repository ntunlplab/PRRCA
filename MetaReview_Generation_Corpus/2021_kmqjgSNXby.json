Extensive numerical results are provided in several continuous domains for both policy evaluation and optimization problems . The results showcase the effectiveness of autoregressive models and , in particular , their superiority over standard feed-forward models . # # # # Pros - The paper is very well-written and easy to follow . The experiments are described with sufficient details to understand the results - The usage of these autoregressive models for model-based RL is , to my knowledge , novel - The paper presents extensive experiments on several challenging domains . The results are convincing and significant . In particular , they show that autoregressive models are superior to feedforward ones # # # # Cons - The paper 's sole contribution seems to be empirical since autoregressive models are ( as acknowledged ) not novel , though their application to this setting is . - While the empirical results are very convincing , I did not find much intuition on where this big improvement over feedforward models comes from ( see detailed comments below ) . - The ordering of the state variables might be a limitation ( again , see below ) . # # # # Detailed comments 1 . As mentioned above , I did not find much intuition on the better performances of autoregressive models vs feedforward ones . As I am not entirely familiar with the system dynamics of the considered domains , do you think that they possess any property which makes autoregressive models more suitable than feedforward ones ( e.g. , strong correlations between next-state variables ) ? Are n't the transition dynamics deterministic in most of the considered domains ? 2.Since the reward in most of the considered domains is ( I suppose ) a function of state , action , and next-state , could it be that one of the reasons behind the worse performance of feedforward models is that they try to predict the reward as a function of state-action only ? Would their performance change if they explicitly modeled the reward as a function of s , a , s ' ? 3.Related to the previous point , the autoregressive model naturally predicts a reward as a function of s , a , s ' since r is considered as the ( n+1 ) -th state component . But what if we re-ordered the state variables with r as the first component instead of the last one ? Would the performance change ? 4.More generally , do you think that the ordering of the state variables might be a limitation ? For instance , could there be an ordering of these variables that makes the model perform well and one that makes it perform poorly ? While in , e.g. , image/text generation problems where autoregressive models are applied we have a natural ordering between the variables involved ( e.g. , by space or time ) , here there seems to be no particular relationship between state variables with similar index . Maybe some additional experiments could help in clarifying whether this could be a limitation or not . Some minor comments/questions : - In Eq.2 , should the product be up to H-1 ? - Before Sec.3 , a citation for `` behavioral cloning '' could be added - Sec.5.3 : the FQE acronym was not introduced - Fig.4 : what is `` r '' above each plot ?", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "reply_text": "Thank you for your valuable feedback and suggestions ! > As mentioned above , I did not find much intuition on the better performances of autoregressive models vs feedforward ones .

Are n't the transition dynamics deterministic in most of the considered domains ? The environments are indeed deterministic . Nevertheless , explicitly modeling the conditional dependence between state dimensions achieves better performance . This can stem from the fact that in DM Control , each task constitutes certain angle constraints for corresponding characters . Standard feedforward models with diagonal covariance structure have no way of ensuring that these angle constraints are satisfied when there is a lot of uncertainty in the prediction . On the other hand , the autoregressive dynamics model is able to avoid unacceptable configurations of the character and ensure angles are compatible with each other . We will add an analysis and an explanation to this phenomenon to the paper . > Since the reward in most of the considered domains is ( I suppose ) a function of state , action , and next-state , could it be that one of the reasons behind the worse performance of feedforward models is that they try to predict the reward as a function of state-action only ?

We believe the order of [ state dimensions , reward ] does not have a significant impact on performance given prior work in NLP , which studies the effect of generation order and finds little difference between different generation orders .

We agree that extending our policy optimization results to the online RL setting is interesting . We opted to focus on the offline setting with a fixed dataset because it enables a more direct comparison between different model-based approaches . It allows us to study the interaction between negative log likelihood and expected return for dynamics models trained on the same dataset of interactions .

See our responses below : > The authors claim that \u201c standard feedforward dynamics models assume that different dimensions of the next state and reward are conditionally independent given the current state and action \u201d . In other words , p ( s \u2019 , r|s , a ) is claimed to be equal to p ( s \u2019 _1|s , a ) \u2026 p ( s \u2019 _n|s , a ) p ( r|s , a ) when using a feedforward model . The statement is incorrect unless we use a linear function approximator as a model . However , this mistake does not affect much the quality of the paper . Thanks for raising this point . In that sentence , we are referring to feedforward models that parametrize the next state as a multivariate Gaussian with a diagonal covariance structure ( Chua et al . ( 2018 ) ; Janner et al . ( 2019 ) ) .In such a parameterization , each dimension of the next state is conditionally independent given the current state and action , independent of the class of functions used . We tried to make this clear in an updated abstract and introduction . Do our changes address your concern ? > Using autoregressive models does not address aspects that are specific to the offline setting . Providing results for the online setting will be helpful for understanding whether autoregressive models should be favored in general for model-based reinforcement learning . We agree that extending our policy optimization results to the online RL setting is interesting . We opted to focus on the offline setting with a fixed dataset because it enables a more direct comparison between different model-based approaches . It allows us to study the interaction between negative log likelihood and expected return for dynamics models trained on the same dataset of interactions . Given the space constraints , we do not think it is feasible to include online RL experiments into the current paper , but we agree that this is an important direction for future work . We expanded on our definition of FQE in the main paper , thank you ."}}
