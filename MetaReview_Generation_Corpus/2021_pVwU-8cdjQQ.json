In this work , we focus on solving it by decomposing a scene into a collection of components by grouping pixels within a probabilistic framework . Each component therefore is encoded into its own latent vector representation , which allows us to reconstruct individual objects independently from the rest of the scene ( see Figure 1 ( \u201c decomposition \u201d ) ) , as opposed to the standard VAE framework , where the entire scene is encoded into a single vector representation . The goal is to make these latent representations encode only the information related to each individual object , and yet the information should be rich enough to have the reconstruction that matches the ground truth image . To evaluate the latter we employ traditional mean squared error ( MSE ) . Because our model groups pixels , the outputs of the model are naturally individual masks corresponding to each object . If the model has separated the objects correctly , the produced mask will also have a high accuracy . Hence , to evaluate a proper separation of the objects it is natural to compare the produced masks with the ground truth masks , which suggests \u201c mask segmentation \u201d as a valid proxy for \u201c object separation \u201d . We would also like to point out that MSE and ARI are metrics that were used in our baselines models as well , meaning its use was necessary to ensure comparability of our evaluations . Despite extensive research in the static scenario , substantially less efforts have focused on scene decomposition in the temporal domain . The temporal aspect makes the task more challenging , since objects can leave or emerge into the frame , they can collide or occlude each other . At the same time , having additional temporal information , that can be explicitly incorporated into the probabilistic framework , can actually improve the model performance and help decompose objects more accurately . And this is exactly what we have demonstrated in our paper . We are showing that by modeling the dynamics we have obtained more precise separations and higher accuracy reconstructions of separate objects . Finally , addressing your point about the interpretable disentangled representation , which surely is an important and nice feature of the model . We have shown that by using the spatial broadcast decoded similarly to IODINE ( Greff et al . ) we have disentangled representations , and can efficiently interpolate in the latent space , by traversing space , size , color and other dimensions of each individual object ( See Figure 12 in Appendix ) and to our knowledge , there is no established quantitative metric for disentanglement . Please note that in order to see appearance change only in one of N objects , when traversing a certain dimension , you need this latent code to be reconstructed into a separated object and this is what we measure with the mask segmentations . * * Minor comments response * * 1 . The issue with using the intersection of unions in evaluating segmentation quality is the inconsistent slot assignments within the same model across a sequence of frames . While our model tends to be very consistent in the object assignments , other methods like IODINE often reorder the slots ( see Figure 11 ) requiring a non-trivial logic to figure out the correct mask to compare to and possibly wrong results . 2.When evaluating our model on the CLEVRER dataset in Table 1 , we used 6 object slots ( K ) for scenes containing 3-5 objects . While for the generalization experiments reported in Table 2 , we used 7 object slots with 6 objects per scene . The expected number of objects is closer to the actual number of objects in the scene in the second experiment , leading to less redundant slots and thus higher accuracy . 3.Thank you for the suggestion , since Reviewer # 1 also pointed out this reference , we have added a discussion of the comparison as a general reply and have added it to the paper as well ."}, {"review_id": "pVwU-8cdjQQ-2", "review_text": "This paper presents a new model for unsupervised video decomposition based on the multi-object scene representation of IODINE . Basically , it makes use of 2D-LSTMs to provide the IODINE framework with a better ability to capture temporal dependencies . 1.My first concern is about the novelty of the proposed model . The most important contribution , if I understand it correctly , is the use of 2D-LSTMs in the iterative amortized inference for temporal modeling . It does extend IODINE into the spatiotemporal context , but it only provides limited new insight into this research field . 2.Another concern is about the CLEVRER experiments . From Table 2 , a counter-intuitive observation is that IODINE significantly outperforms Seq-IODINE . There might be two reasons : ( a ) In this dataset , the temporal dependencies between frames are relatively weak , because future frames depend not only on previous ones but also on a series of actions . ( b ) Seq-IODINE may not be a strong baseline model ; If so , the authors might include other existing approaches specifically designed for video data , such as R-NEM and DDPAE [ Hsieh et al. , 2018 ] . [ Hsieh et al. , 2018 ] Learning to Decompose and Disentangle Representations for Video Prediction . 3.Although I am aware that R-NEM and IODINE were also evaluated on the synthetic datasets only , I recommend that the authors validate the model on real-world datasets of non-rigid objects and more complex structures . 4.If the authors can provide a direct qualitative comparison with R-NEM and IODINE in Figures 3-4 , it will be easier to understand the advantages of the proposed model . 5.In Section 2 , the authors could use a separate paragraph to describe the main differences between the proposed model and previous ones , in particular R-NEM and IODINE .", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We thank the reviewer for their thoughtful feedback and valuable suggestions . We address the comments below . 1.It is correct that the use of a 2D-LSTM within the iterative amortized inference framework is one of our main contributions . We emphasize that the extension from the 1D case is non-trivial and the use of conditional priors , in particular , proved to be an effective modeling choice in the inference process , as illustrated by our ablation study ( Table 3 ) . As a direct consequence of this contribution , we obtain : - A fast and efficient scene decomposition with interpretable and disentangled latent representation , which is preserved over the whole sequence . - Implicit probabilistic dynamics for each object in the scene , resulting in higher overall accuracy and explicit temporal hidden states . Furthermore , while we present our architecture in the context of video decomposition , we believe it to be valuable in a variety of other scenarios requiring temporal consistency and hence view it as having a much broader appeal than this application may suggest . Finally , we want to mention that we have extended the CLEVRER dataset and have made it publicly available to the community . 2.- Apart from suffering from exploding gradients and lack of explicit dynamics ( see Section 4.3 ) , SEQ-IODINE ( unlike IODINE ) does not include iterative refinements of each frame , which explains why it performs worse . This also leads to the first frame of a sequence being worse than the rest , which additionally lowers the accuracy of the decompositions . - R-NEM and DDPAE are both tailored to binary data . Additionally , DDPAE is based on an attention mechanism and , as such , does not approach scene decomposition by grouping pixels . Consequently , DDPAE is not evaluated on segmentation tasks , as it can not generate masks . The paper also focuses on physics modelling , where it is a strong baseline for the prediction of dynamics ( see below ) . In order to compare our model to R-NEM and DDPAE on CLEVRER , we would need to binarize it . However , that would render occlusions , which are a valuable component of the 3D scenes in CLEVRER , meaningless . We have therefore decided not to include these comparisons . Nonetheless , we agree that a discussion of DDPAE is important and have added a paragraph to our related work section . Additionally , we conducted an experiment comparing the predictive power of our model to DDPAE on the Bouncing Balls dataset ( Figure 4 ) . We measure performance as the cosine similarity of the velocity prediction of both models . As expected , our model outperforms DDPAE on the first three frames and then declines in quality . This behavior is not surprising and in line with results reported in the paper ( see Figure 5 ) . Simulation is not our model \u2019 s main use case , though , and should be seen as an auxiliary task based on our model \u2019 s object dynamics . 3.We agree that evaluating our method on a real-world dataset would make the paper more well-rounded . For this reason , we are including an evaluation on the Grand Central Station dataset ( Figure 7 ) , which is the only real-world dataset used to evaluate models similar to ours . In order to keep the number of objects in the scene manageable , we have extracted a cropped fragment from the video sequence . We have added dataset details as well as a qualitative evaluation to the paper . Since the dataset does not contain ground truth segmentation masks , a quantitative evaluation was not possible . We think running ( SEQ- ) IODINE on the same dataset will give more meaning to the experiment and will do it for the final version of the paper . 4.While the limited rebuttal period did not allow us to generate these results for R-NEM , we agree that such a direct qualitative comparison would highlight the advantages of our method and will include it in the final version of the paper . For a comparison with IODINE and SEQ_IODINE , please see Figure 13 in the Appendix . 5.We have included this discussion in the paper ."}, {"review_id": "pVwU-8cdjQQ-3", "review_text": "The paper presents a model for the unsupervised decomposition of videos into objects . It builds on previous models operating on individual images such as IODINE and GENESIS , and extends them to the video domain by conducting iterative inference also across the time dimension , leading to a computation graph resembling a 2D grid . It is shown that the proposed model provides more accurate scene decompositions than previous ones , and generalizes better to different numbers of objects . Predictions of future frames appear somewhat less accurate . Strengths : 1 . The proposed method closes an important gap in the landscape of unsupervised object-based models : It is the first such method to decompose colored videos using pixel-wise segmentation masks . The method is well motivated and clearly presented . 2.The experimental evaluation follows the precedent set by R-NEM , IODINE , and others . It appears to have been rigorously conducted and shows encouraging results in terms of scene decomposition and generalization . The reduced reliance on color information , which has plagued previous models such as MoNET , is especially welcome . 3.The main technical contribution , the two-dimensional refinement method , seems to provide clear benefits over previous ad-hoc implementations such as SEQ-IODINE , both in terms of runtime and performance . Weaknesses : 1 . As noted by the authors , predictive performance is somewhat lacking , which may be explained by the lack of relational components . 2.Using the inference network as opposed to the generative model for prediction seems to run counter to the idea of learning a generative model to accurately model the distribution of the data . In particular , because the generative distribution $ p ( z_t | x_ { < t } , z_ { < t } ) $ seems ill-equipped to model object interactions . 3.Like all unsupervised object-models , this work is still quite far away from working on natural videos . Overall , I believe this paper fills an important gap that many members of the community were waiting to see filled . It is well executed and adds some interesting ideas to the toolset of unsupervised object models . I therefore recommend acceptance . Questions : 1 . It seems that during inference , interactions between slots may be taken into account through the gradients of the likelihood . But during prediction , those are set to zero , and the prior over $ z_t $ seems to operate slot-wise as well . So can object interactions be computed at all during prediction , or are the slots predicted independently of one another ? 2.The choice of $ \\hat { R } $ seems to express the idea that once a good latent state has been inferred , a single refinement step is enough to update it given new observations . Would additional steps be beneficial when receiving unexpected input , such as frames with newly appearing objects on CLEVRER ? Could the number of steps perhaps even be selected dynamically based on e.g.the reconstruction error ?", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "reply_text": "We thank the reviewer for highlighting the contribution and strengths of the paper and the overall positive view . We address the questions below . 1.As you correctly stated the slots relations are only taken into account in the final step of the generation where the likelihood is computed . When the gradients are propagated back through the network the interaction and relative positions of the objects are learned by the network . Therefore the answer to your question is yes , the slots become predicted independently , when the gradients are set to zero . This may explain the fast decline of the prediction accuracy as you stated . However , prediction is not the main goal of our work , and we were focusing on improved accuracy of the decompositions . By showing that the prediction works for a few frames we demonstrated that in our framework one can get short predictions for \u201c free \u201d . Review also mentioned the \u201c relational component \u201d , which we have considered , however in the architecture of our model adding a slot self attention would further increase the complexity , and thus significantly hurt its scalability . In Section E of the Appendix we have mentioned adding a relational component in the future work , however , we should be mindful of making this as scalable as possible , so making a relational component scalable within these types of models . We will consider this in future work , but view this as being outside the scope of the current paper . 2.The quality of the segmentation does not particularly degrade when a new object enters the scene ( see Figure 13 ) , especially compared to baselines . However , it is a good suggestion to select the number of refinement steps dynamically as it would make the framework more flexible . In general , this would lead to an increase in the number of refinement steps \u201c on average \u201d compared to the current model , which , in preliminary experiments , we saw to improve the performance . We will experiment with this more thoroughly and include a qualitative example in the paper ."}], "0": {"review_id": "pVwU-8cdjQQ-0", "review_text": "In this paper , the authors propose to better explicitly utilize the sequential information in the video to improve the performance of unsupervised scene decomposition in video .

While our model tends to be very consistent in the object assignments , other methods like IODINE often reorder the slots ( see Figure 11 ) requiring a non-trivial logic to figure out the correct mask to compare to and possibly wrong results . 2.When evaluating our model on the CLEVRER dataset in Table 1 , we used 6 object slots ( K ) for scenes containing 3-5 objects . While for the generalization experiments reported in Table 2 , we used 7 object slots with 6 objects per scene . The expected number of objects is closer to the actual number of objects in the scene in the second experiment , leading to less redundant slots and thus higher accuracy . 3.Thank you for the suggestion , since Reviewer # 1 also pointed out this reference , we have added a discussion of the comparison as a general reply and have added it to the paper as well ."}, "2": {"review_id": "pVwU-8cdjQQ-2", "review_text": "This paper presents a new model for unsupervised video decomposition based on the multi-object scene representation of IODINE . Basically , it makes use of 2D-LSTMs to provide the IODINE framework with a better ability to capture temporal dependencies . 1.My first concern is about the novelty of the proposed model . The most important contribution , if I understand it correctly , is the use of 2D-LSTMs in the iterative amortized inference for temporal modeling . It does extend IODINE into the spatiotemporal context , but it only provides limited new insight into this research field . 2.Another concern is about the CLEVRER experiments . From Table 2 , a counter-intuitive observation is that IODINE significantly outperforms Seq-IODINE . There might be two reasons : ( a ) In this dataset , the temporal dependencies between frames are relatively weak , because future frames depend not only on previous ones but also on a series of actions . ( b ) Seq-IODINE may not be a strong baseline model ; If so , the authors might include other existing approaches specifically designed for video data , such as R-NEM and DDPAE [ Hsieh et al. , 2018 ] . [ Hsieh et al. , 2018 ] Learning to Decompose and Disentangle Representations for Video Prediction . 3.Although I am aware that R-NEM and IODINE were also evaluated on the synthetic datasets only , I recommend that the authors validate the model on real-world datasets of non-rigid objects and more complex structures . 4.If the authors can provide a direct qualitative comparison with R-NEM and IODINE in Figures 3-4 , it will be easier to understand the advantages of the proposed model . 5.In Section 2 , the authors could use a separate paragraph to describe the main differences between the proposed model and previous ones , in particular R-NEM and IODINE .", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We thank the reviewer for their thoughtful feedback and valuable suggestions . We address the comments below . 1.It is correct that the use of a 2D-LSTM within the iterative amortized inference framework is one of our main contributions . We emphasize that the extension from the 1D case is non-trivial and the use of conditional priors , in particular , proved to be an effective modeling choice in the inference process , as illustrated by our ablation study ( Table 3 ) . As a direct consequence of this contribution , we obtain : - A fast and efficient scene decomposition with interpretable and disentangled latent representation , which is preserved over the whole sequence . - Implicit probabilistic dynamics for each object in the scene , resulting in higher overall accuracy and explicit temporal hidden states . Furthermore , while we present our architecture in the context of video decomposition , we believe it to be valuable in a variety of other scenarios requiring temporal consistency and hence view it as having a much broader appeal than this application may suggest . Finally , we want to mention that we have extended the CLEVRER dataset and have made it publicly available to the community . 2.- Apart from suffering from exploding gradients and lack of explicit dynamics ( see Section 4.3 ) , SEQ-IODINE ( unlike IODINE ) does not include iterative refinements of each frame , which explains why it performs worse . This also leads to the first frame of a sequence being worse than the rest , which additionally lowers the accuracy of the decompositions . - R-NEM and DDPAE are both tailored to binary data . Additionally , DDPAE is based on an attention mechanism and , as such , does not approach scene decomposition by grouping pixels . Consequently , DDPAE is not evaluated on segmentation tasks , as it can not generate masks . The paper also focuses on physics modelling , where it is a strong baseline for the prediction of dynamics ( see below ) . In order to compare our model to R-NEM and DDPAE on CLEVRER , we would need to binarize it . However , that would render occlusions , which are a valuable component of the 3D scenes in CLEVRER , meaningless . We have therefore decided not to include these comparisons . Nonetheless , we agree that a discussion of DDPAE is important and have added a paragraph to our related work section . Additionally , we conducted an experiment comparing the predictive power of our model to DDPAE on the Bouncing Balls dataset ( Figure 4 ) . We measure performance as the cosine similarity of the velocity prediction of both models . As expected , our model outperforms DDPAE on the first three frames and then declines in quality . This behavior is not surprising and in line with results reported in the paper ( see Figure 5 ) . Simulation is not our model \u2019 s main use case , though , and should be seen as an auxiliary task based on our model \u2019 s object dynamics . 3.We agree that evaluating our method on a real-world dataset would make the paper more well-rounded . For this reason , we are including an evaluation on the Grand Central Station dataset ( Figure 7 ) , which is the only real-world dataset used to evaluate models similar to ours . In order to keep the number of objects in the scene manageable , we have extracted a cropped fragment from the video sequence . We have added dataset details as well as a qualitative evaluation to the paper . Since the dataset does not contain ground truth segmentation masks , a quantitative evaluation was not possible . We think running ( SEQ- ) IODINE on the same dataset will give more meaning to the experiment and will do it for the final version of the paper . 4.While the limited rebuttal period did not allow us to generate these results for R-NEM , we agree that such a direct qualitative comparison would highlight the advantages of our method and will include it in the final version of the paper . For a comparison with IODINE and SEQ_IODINE , please see Figure 13 in the Appendix . 5.We have included this discussion in the paper ."}, "3": {"review_id": "pVwU-8cdjQQ-3", "review_text": "The paper presents a model for the unsupervised decomposition of videos into objects . It builds on previous models operating on individual images such as IODINE and GENESIS , and extends them to the video domain by conducting iterative inference also across the time dimension , leading to a computation graph resembling a 2D grid . It is shown that the proposed model provides more accurate scene decompositions than previous ones , and generalizes better to different numbers of objects . Predictions of future frames appear somewhat less accurate . Strengths : 1 . The proposed method closes an important gap in the landscape of unsupervised object-based models : It is the first such method to decompose colored videos using pixel-wise segmentation masks . The method is well motivated and clearly presented . 2.The experimental evaluation follows the precedent set by R-NEM , IODINE , and others . It appears to have been rigorously conducted and shows encouraging results in terms of scene decomposition and generalization . The reduced reliance on color information , which has plagued previous models such as MoNET , is especially welcome . 3.The main technical contribution , the two-dimensional refinement method , seems to provide clear benefits over previous ad-hoc implementations such as SEQ-IODINE , both in terms of runtime and performance . Weaknesses : 1 . As noted by the authors , predictive performance is somewhat lacking , which may be explained by the lack of relational components . 2.Using the inference network as opposed to the generative model for prediction seems to run counter to the idea of learning a generative model to accurately model the distribution of the data . In particular , because the generative distribution $ p ( z_t | x_ { < t } , z_ { < t } ) $ seems ill-equipped to model object interactions . 3.Like all unsupervised object-models , this work is still quite far away from working on natural videos . Overall , I believe this paper fills an important gap that many members of the community were waiting to see filled . It is well executed and adds some interesting ideas to the toolset of unsupervised object models . I therefore recommend acceptance . Questions : 1 . It seems that during inference , interactions between slots may be taken into account through the gradients of the likelihood . But during prediction , those are set to zero , and the prior over $ z_t $ seems to operate slot-wise as well . So can object interactions be computed at all during prediction , or are the slots predicted independently of one another ? 2.The choice of $ \\hat { R } $ seems to express the idea that once a good latent state has been inferred , a single refinement step is enough to update it given new observations . Would additional steps be beneficial when receiving unexpected input , such as frames with newly appearing objects on CLEVRER ? Could the number of steps perhaps even be selected dynamically based on e.g.the reconstruction error ?", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "reply_text": "We thank the reviewer for highlighting the contribution and strengths of the paper and the overall positive view . We address the questions below . 1.As you correctly stated the slots relations are only taken into account in the final step of the generation where the likelihood is computed . When the gradients are propagated back through the network the interaction and relative positions of the objects are learned by the network . Therefore the answer to your question is yes , the slots become predicted independently , when the gradients are set to zero . This may explain the fast decline of the prediction accuracy as you stated . However , prediction is not the main goal of our work , and we were focusing on improved accuracy of the decompositions . By showing that the prediction works for a few frames we demonstrated that in our framework one can get short predictions for \u201c free \u201d . Review also mentioned the \u201c relational component \u201d , which we have considered , however in the architecture of our model adding a slot self attention would further increase the complexity , and thus significantly hurt its scalability . In Section E of the Appendix we have mentioned adding a relational component in the future work , however , we should be mindful of making this as scalable as possible , so making a relational component scalable within these types of models . We will consider this in future work , but view this as being outside the scope of the current paper . 2.The quality of the segmentation does not particularly degrade when a new object enters the scene ( see Figure 13 ) , especially compared to baselines . However , it is a good suggestion to select the number of refinement steps dynamically as it would make the framework more flexible . In general , this would lead to an increase in the number of refinement steps \u201c on average \u201d compared to the current model , which , in preliminary experiments , we saw to improve the performance . We will experiment with this more thoroughly and include a qualitative example in the paper ."}}
