The reviewers found the results on different sources of nondeterminism particularly interesting and relevant. The experiments are carried on both language and also vision, which strengthens the findings. Concerns were raised about the use of smaller non-standard models, which were somewhat mitigated by the addition of Resnet-18 experiments on CIFAR. The reviewers also noted that the measures used in the experimental protocol were already present in the literature, and that the proposed mitigation strategy is from another work. Furthermore, R2 also found that the optimization instability section should be more developed.

The authors establish an experimental strategy to analyze the different sources of nondeterminism . Some sources of nondeterminism are parameter initialization , data shuffling , data augmentation , regularization and cuDNN . The authors make the surprising discovery that each source of nondeterminism results in an equal amount of variability and model diversity . By modifying weights by a single bit , they experimentally demonstrate that an inherent instability in the neural network optimization procedure is the main reason . They show methods such as snapshot ensembling can reduce the observed variability . # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Strong points : The discovery that each nondeterminism source has a similar effect is novel and is not in the literature as far as I know . Such results are intriguing , unexpected and useful . The experimental methodology used is well-explained and fair . Linking all the nondeterminism to a change of one bit in model weights is interesting and successfully highlights the instability and sensitivity of neural network optimization . # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Weak points : Please can the authors clarify the takeaways of section 4.2 ? At the moment the novelty or surprise is not entirely clear . If the single linear layer problem is convex , it is expected that a single bit initialization perturbation still leads to the global minimum . Due to nonconvexity , the one hidden layer networks can have different minima and so there is more variability . But how does the extent of the variability change with depth ? Please can the authors elaborate on the connection between the ensembling solution and how it prevents optimization instability which was identified as a root cause ? Ensembling methods in general will help variability but there is no change in the optimization and training process and ensembling gains are due to other reasons . While it is understandable that there is significant compute time required to do multiple runs , the networks used are much smaller than current state-of-the-art networks . For example , a WideResNet-28x10 can give approximately 95 % test accuracy for CIFAR-10 and has a much larger capacity than the ResNet-14 . The paper would be strengthened by having experiments on popular benchmark state-of-the-art networks ( maybe fewer runs and not as many nondeterminism sources as in Table 1 ) . This is especially relevant due to the huge gulf in the number of trainable parameters in state-of-the-art networks which means potentially very different functions can be learned run-to-rundo the trends in Table 6 carry through for big networks ? Why were 500 epochs used for the CIFAR experiments ? 500 epochs are plenty for training the ResNets for CIFAR-10 classification and is much larger than what is common in the literature . Furthermore , with five snapshots , this is like having five models trained for 100 epochs each which on its own is enough ( or almost enough ) for a single model . Do the authors have a more realistic set of experiments ( such as a total of 200 epochs and four to five snapshots ) ? # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Recommendation : Overall I lean towards rejection . I think the results ( such as Table 1 ) are extremely interesting and should be known in the community , however , the current analysis of the optimization instability should be developed .

In the experiment of Figure 2 , is the cosine learning rate decay used from epoch 0 ?

Here are the answers to your questions : Sec 4.2 : What we found is stronger than linear models converging to the same optimum -- rather , the entire optimization trajectory itself remains nearly unperturbed . We will add a figure to the Appendix to further demonstrate this in our revision within the next week . In terms of how variability changes with depth , this can be determined by comparing our results for a subset of the architectures considered in our work ( linear , two-layer , ResNet-6 , ResNet-10 , and ResNet-14 , with an additional ResNet-18 to be added ) . Ensembling and optimization instability : As you correctly point out , ensembling by itself does n't mitigate instability in optimization , but ensembled models themselves have reduced variance or diversity since they are composed of multiple submodels , averaging the predictions of each of its members . This averaging is what drives the variance reduction . Thank you for pointing out this opportunity to add clarity in our writing , which we will add in our revision . Larger networks : We will add a wide ResNet-18 model to the revision , which has an accuracy of ~94.9 % on CIFAR-10 and shows a similar trend in results . Number of epochs : This is a very good question ! We originally chose 500 epochs for all of our experiments out of caution , making sure that models had enough time to converge ( though as noted in the appendix , changing the training duration did not have much effect on model variability ) . Nonetheless , we do see your point that this could give an unfair advantage to the snapshot approach in reducing variability . Thus , we will add new experiments with 200-epoch training to our revision , which we have found show the same trend as the others despite the reduced training time . ResNet-18 : Yes , we will add these experiments to our revision . Learning rate : Good question -- yes , a cosine learning rate decay was used starting from the beginning ( after three epochs of learning rate warmup ) . We have since performed a handful of experiments varying the learning rate ( and optionally varying the number of training epochs to compensate ) , which we will add to the Appendix in the revision . In short , the maximum learning rate does not appear to have a significant effect on model variability , leading us to believe that it is not the primary driver of this curious effect .

Scale/Novelty : With all due respect , we think that the novelty of the paper lies in the impact of researching this problem -- the problem we study affects nearly all of deep learning , and our work is the first to study it in depth . Doing so necessarily requires training hundreds of models for a single experiment ( e.g.700 trained models for Table 1 alone ) . Repeating this on a larger dataset ( e.g.ImageNet ) , even in the optimistic scenario of model training taking only 24 hours on a single GPU to converge , would take roughly 2 years of GPU time . We agree that such research would be beneficial to the community in making our findings even more robust . However , doing so is simply only possible for very few research labs with very large computational resources . By choosing to study the problem with more tractable models and datasets , we have been able to conduct detailed analyses on nondeterminism during training and discover two highly non-intuitive facts : 1 ) that each source of nondeterminism results in similar levels of final model variability and diversity , and 2 ) that instability in optimization offers an explanation for this . Ensembling intuition : While we thank you for your comment , we have a different opinion . Though some may find it intuitive that ensembling can reduce model variability , it is typically not the first choice one would make ( i.e.training multiple model replicas and taking the average ) . It is also unclear that accelerated model ensembling strategies would necessarily maintain the advantage of ensembling in reducing variance .

Defining non-determinism : Thank you for the suggestion ! We will incorporate this in our revision . Changing nondeterminism sequentially and simultaneously : We vary a subset of sources simultaneously ( e.g . `` Data Shuffling + cuDNN '' , `` Data Shuffling + Aug. + cuDNN '' , and `` All nondeterminism sources '' in Table 1 ) , and vary sources sequentially ( changing seeds across time during training ) in Sec.3.4.However , we are not sure if we are interpreting the reviewer correctly , and any clarification would be much appreciated so that we can improve our work ."}, "3": {"review_id": "SQ7EHTDyn9Y-3", "review_text": "This paper discusses nondeterminism and instability in neural network optimization . The authors establish an experimental protocol to understand the effect of optimization nondeterminism on model diversity , and study the independent effect of different sources of nondeterminism . Pros : 1.Show that different sources of nondeterminism give similar level of variability effect on the final accuracy and loss . 2.The source of the above phenomenon comes from model optimization instability . 3.Provide one possible direction for reducing the variability . Cons : 1.The accelerated model ensembling is from another work and using ensemble to reduce variability is quite intuitive . 2.More experiments need to be done on larger datasets to further demonstrate the findings of this work . 3.More novelty is needed for this work to be published in ICLR .", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Thank you for reading and providing comments on our work . Scale/Novelty : With all due respect , we think that the novelty of the paper lies in the impact of researching this problem -- the problem we study affects nearly all of deep learning , and our work is the first to study it in depth . Doing so necessarily requires training hundreds of models for a single experiment ( e.g.700 trained models for Table 1 alone ) . Repeating this on a larger dataset ( e.g.ImageNet ) , even in the optimistic scenario of model training taking only 24 hours on a single GPU to converge , would take roughly 2 years of GPU time . We agree that such research would be beneficial to the community in making our findings even more robust . However , doing so is simply only possible for very few research labs with very large computational resources . By choosing to study the problem with more tractable models and datasets , we have been able to conduct detailed analyses on nondeterminism during training and discover two highly non-intuitive facts : 1 ) that each source of nondeterminism results in similar levels of final model variability and diversity , and 2 ) that instability in optimization offers an explanation for this . Ensembling intuition : While we thank you for your comment , we have a different opinion . Though some may find it intuitive that ensembling can reduce model variability , it is typically not the first choice one would make ( i.e.training multiple model replicas and taking the average ) . It is also unclear that accelerated model ensembling strategies would necessarily maintain the advantage of ensembling in reducing variance . In fact , many approaches exist with at least some intuition backing them up , yet fail to work ( Appendix A ) ."}}
