Below is my overview of the paper with additional related works ( some are suggestions that would enhance the paper ) : - Branching Q-learning ( BQL ) in Ref . [ I ] is similar ( if not the same ) to the independent critic of FSAC . Using this approach they scale to domains with 33^17 discrete actions . - Autoregressive critic of FSAC is the same as that in Metz et al . ( 2017 ) ( also stated in the paper I believe ) . - Independent versions of numerous PG methods have been previously developed and studied extensively by Tang and Agrawal ( 2020 ) . Also , the original TRPO paper was used with independent discrete sub-action policies in Atari tasks ( if I remember correctly ) . Therefore , there is nothing new about FPPO-independent ( also stated in the paper I believe ) . - Other methods for learning the independent critic in FSAC are also possible but are not discussed in the paper ( see e.g.Ref . [ II ] ) .Moreover , Ref . [ II ] uses independent policies with A2C . - When independent policies are used in PG , a better baseline can be used which provably reduces variance [ III ] . Discussion of such a baseline would be very useful in this paper which somewhat serves to summarize deep RL in factored action spaces . - Ref . [ IV ] combines autoregressive and independent proposal policies for approximate Q-maximization in Q-learning . In this way , they scale to very high-dimensional action spaces . This work is able to handle hybrid action spaces without discretization . A discussion and positioning with respect to this paper could be valuable . 2 ) Experiments fall very short in my opinion . Below are some of the experiments that I think are necessary to include : - Figure 1a , b : Why not run FSAC ? - Figure 1c : I believe the autoregressive FPPO and FSAC are reported in Platform . But why not independent ? Why not report the standard ( non-factored ) baselines of PPO and SAC ? - Figure 2 : Compare against the continuous versions of SAC and PPO on MuJoCo . - Figure 2 : Why not evaluate autoregressive policies in MuJoCo ? Metz et al.did that with DQN . 3 ) No new factorization schemes are explored in this paper . For instance , Ref . [ V ] explores a mixture of independent and sequential action-value function representations . A discussion of the spectrum of other possible factorizations would be interesting .

Unless the paper also incorporates analysis and results for purely action-value methods ( e.g.DQN-based agents such as Sequential and Branching Q-learning ) , the paper should specify that policy optimization methods are of focus . Also , stating atomic factorization in multidimensional action spaces instead of only `` factored '' could clarify the kind of factorization that is the subject of this paper . - `` FPPO was trained only for 2 days on 4 CPU cores while IMPALA was trained with 150 CPU cores . `` : This is not very useful without providing training-time of IMPALA . - The word action is frequently used instead of action dimension and sub-action . - `` With this transformation , both factored agents reach completion in a few time steps , see Figure 1c '' : Saying `` a few time steps '' for a plot that goes to 90k time steps is somewhat strange . - This work claims to develop techniques for dealing with hybrid action spaces . But in the experiments , this is not demonstrated . In fact , the action space in Gym Platform features discrete and continuous sub-action spaces , but they are discretized . As such , I think this paper should state dealing with discrete action spaces or continuous ones via discretization .", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "reply_text": "We warmly thank the reviewer 2 for the thorough review and all the additional references we missed .

I 'm curious about any potential use for extending it to deterministic policies ; e.g.could it be useful to use an autoregressive policy network with DDPG ? We consider stochastic policies as the action spaces we consider are discrete and to the extent of our knowledge no successful deterministic method can deal with discrete actions . Indeed , it might be interesting to sequence 1D continuous deterministic actions however as stated in the general response , our aim in this study is not to provide new tools for continuous control . We rather used MuJoCo benchmarks only to show the scalability and correctness of our derivations . 4 ) I think that the manual ordering of the sub-action spaces in an auto-regressive policy could introduce bias ( i.e.I think there could be a setting that some orderings would make it impossible to learn the optimal policy ) .

This is usually difficult due to the vast number of possibilities during exploration . They address this issue by studying existing approaches of splitting the action into a finite number of sub-actions and then sampling each sub-action independently or auto-regressively . This leads to a reduction in the candidate actions during exploration which would improve the sample efficiency . Also , This splitting is referred to as \u201c Factorization of Action Space \u201d . They majorly study this factorization with PPO and SAC and show how to estimate kl-divergence and entropy in each of these methods . Also , they introduce the notion of using independent q-values for each of the sub-actions which semantically represents expected \u201c sub-action - value \u201d for any action in the current policy with that sub-action . They show their results on multi-agent and mujoco tasks . # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Reasons for score : Overall , I do like the paper .

HOWEVER , they don \u2019 t make comparison with the unfactored ( original ) versions of these algorithms . I believe without the comparison with the baseline PPO and SAC , one can not establish the gain in sample efficiency . - The number of discrete sub-actions ( \u201c m \u201d ) for the policy is treated as a hyper-parameter . This is one of the core challenges for continuous control tasks as the environments could be highly sensitive to this choice . They don \u2019 t show any concrete evidence for the choice of number of sub-actions made by them , in particular for control tasks . - How does one decide on the order of the autoregressive actions ? This is not clear from their work . Do they manually analyze each sub-action and decide on the order ?

This paper also talks about auto-regressive actions . The following series of work involves the decomposition of Q-values for Actor/Critic and Q-learning approaches in multi-agent settings . The major difference is that instead of treating the reward as a vector where each reward component belongs to a specific q-values ; you are giving the same reward to each Q-value . - Value-Decomposition Networks For Cooperative Multi-Agent Learning - QMIX : Monotonic Value Function Factorisation for Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning - Hybrid Reward Architecture for Reinforcement Learning - Explainable Reinforcement Learning via Reward Decomposition # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # I would be happy to revise my score post clarifications from the authors .", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We warmly thank the reviewer for the insightful review . The reviewer highlights that : ( a ) FPPO and FSAC are not compared with their unfactored versions on MuJoCo environments . We agree.However , we would like to clarify that we did not introduce continuous control benchmarks to demonstrate that factored agents outperform their non factored counter-parts , neither in performance nor sample efficiency . Indeed , we observed equivalent performance and sample efficiency for both factored and continuous versions of the agents , with sometimes a slightly improved performance for the continuous version . Our goal was rather to demonstrate the scalability of the approach even when the number of actions becomes very large as well as their correctness and to do it on well-known benchmarks . ( b ) We do not provide concrete evidence for the choice of the number of sub-actions in the continuous control tasks . As in Metz et al.2017 , we did not find any strong impact on the performance as long as it is greater than 5 . However , we understand the need for a precise study and will add it in a future version of this work . ( c ) We do not give enough evidence on how the order of the auto-regressive actions is chosen , though it could play a significant role for performance . In Platform-v0 this order is straightforward as the agent must first choose the action type and then the action intensity . In Google Football , while we found that enabling auto-regressivity was critical to achieve good performance , we also found that this choice does not impact the results in practice . Finally , we did not use an auto-regressive factorization of the action space for the MuJoCo benchmarks but an independent factorization instead ."}], "0": {"review_id": "naSAkn2Xo46-0", "review_text": "# # # Summary The paper presents a study of factored action spaces for RL problems , and two basic forms of this , i.e. , independent factorization ( IF ) and autoregressive factorization ( AF ) .

Below are some of the experiments that I think are necessary to include : - Figure 1a , b : Why not run FSAC ? - Figure 1c : I believe the autoregressive FPPO and FSAC are reported in Platform . But why not independent ? Why not report the standard ( non-factored ) baselines of PPO and SAC ? - Figure 2 : Compare against the continuous versions of SAC and PPO on MuJoCo . - Figure 2 : Why not evaluate autoregressive policies in MuJoCo ? Metz et al.did that with DQN . 3 ) No new factorization schemes are explored in this paper . For instance , Ref . [ V ] explores a mixture of independent and sequential action-value function representations . A discussion of the spectrum of other possible factorizations would be interesting .

Unless the paper also incorporates analysis and results for purely action-value methods ( e.g.DQN-based agents such as Sequential and Branching Q-learning ) , the paper should specify that policy optimization methods are of focus . Also , stating atomic factorization in multidimensional action spaces instead of only `` factored '' could clarify the kind of factorization that is the subject of this paper . - `` FPPO was trained only for 2 days on 4 CPU cores while IMPALA was trained with 150 CPU cores . `` : This is not very useful without providing training-time of IMPALA . - The word action is frequently used instead of action dimension and sub-action . - `` With this transformation , both factored agents reach completion in a few time steps , see Figure 1c '' : Saying `` a few time steps '' for a plot that goes to 90k time steps is somewhat strange . - This work claims to develop techniques for dealing with hybrid action spaces . But in the experiments , this is not demonstrated . In fact , the action space in Gym Platform features discrete and continuous sub-action spaces , but they are discretized . As such , I think this paper should state dealing with discrete action spaces or continuous ones via discretization .", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "reply_text": "We warmly thank the reviewer 2 for the thorough review and all the additional references we missed . These references will strengthen our future version of the paper .

I 'm curious about any potential use for extending it to deterministic policies ; e.g.could it be useful to use an autoregressive policy network with DDPG ? We consider stochastic policies as the action spaces we consider are discrete and to the extent of our knowledge no successful deterministic method can deal with discrete actions . Indeed , it might be interesting to sequence 1D continuous deterministic actions however as stated in the general response , our aim in this study is not to provide new tools for continuous control . We rather used MuJoCo benchmarks only to show the scalability and correctness of our derivations . 4 ) I think that the manual ordering of the sub-action spaces in an auto-regressive policy could introduce bias ( i.e.I think there could be a setting that some orderings would make it impossible to learn the optimal policy ) .

This is usually difficult due to the vast number of possibilities during exploration . They address this issue by studying existing approaches of splitting the action into a finite number of sub-actions and then sampling each sub-action independently or auto-regressively . This leads to a reduction in the candidate actions during exploration which would improve the sample efficiency . Also , This splitting is referred to as \u201c Factorization of Action Space \u201d . They majorly study this factorization with PPO and SAC and show how to estimate kl-divergence and entropy in each of these methods . Also , they introduce the notion of using independent q-values for each of the sub-actions which semantically represents expected \u201c sub-action - value \u201d for any action in the current policy with that sub-action . They show their results on multi-agent and mujoco tasks . # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Reasons for score : Overall , I do like the paper . However , at this moment , I will keep the paper below acceptance . This is due to the issues raised in Cons section which I believed should be addressed/discussed before I revise my score . In particular , I would expect authors to have at least PPO and SAC baseline in their work . # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Pros : -Large action space has been one of the bottlenecks for scalability in reinforcement learning and the paper studies factorization for on-policy methods which to my understanding has not been done before . -They provide theoretical analysis for estimation of entropy and kl-divergence in PPO and SAC . -They show their results on both multi-agent settings as well as control . # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Cons : - They merely make a comparison between FPPO and FSAC which are the factored versions of respective algorithms and show that FSAC seems to be more robust and has better sample efficiency . HOWEVER , they don \u2019 t make comparison with the unfactored ( original ) versions of these algorithms . I believe without the comparison with the baseline PPO and SAC , one can not establish the gain in sample efficiency . - The number of discrete sub-actions ( \u201c m \u201d ) for the policy is treated as a hyper-parameter . This is one of the core challenges for continuous control tasks as the environments could be highly sensitive to this choice . They don \u2019 t show any concrete evidence for the choice of number of sub-actions made by them , in particular for control tasks . - How does one decide on the order of the autoregressive actions ? This is not clear from their work . Do they manually analyze each sub-action and decide on the order ? I believe this order could play a significant role for performance . # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Questions during the rebuttal period : Please address and clarify the cons above Optional : You may want to cite the following : Q-LEARNING IN ENORMOUS ACTION SPACES VIA AMORTIZED APPROXIMATE MAXIMIZATION ( https : //arxiv.org/abs/2001.08116 ) . This paper also talks about auto-regressive actions . The following series of work involves the decomposition of Q-values for Actor/Critic and Q-learning approaches in multi-agent settings . The major difference is that instead of treating the reward as a vector where each reward component belongs to a specific q-values ; you are giving the same reward to each Q-value . - Value-Decomposition Networks For Cooperative Multi-Agent Learning - QMIX : Monotonic Value Function Factorisation for Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning - Hybrid Reward Architecture for Reinforcement Learning - Explainable Reinforcement Learning via Reward Decomposition # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # I would be happy to revise my score post clarifications from the authors .", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We warmly thank the reviewer for the insightful review . The reviewer highlights that : ( a ) FPPO and FSAC are not compared with their unfactored versions on MuJoCo environments . We agree.However , we would like to clarify that we did not introduce continuous control benchmarks to demonstrate that factored agents outperform their non factored counter-parts , neither in performance nor sample efficiency . Indeed , we observed equivalent performance and sample efficiency for both factored and continuous versions of the agents , with sometimes a slightly improved performance for the continuous version . Our goal was rather to demonstrate the scalability of the approach even when the number of actions becomes very large as well as their correctness and to do it on well-known benchmarks . ( b ) We do not provide concrete evidence for the choice of the number of sub-actions in the continuous control tasks . As in Metz et al.2017 , we did not find any strong impact on the performance as long as it is greater than 5 . However , we understand the need for a precise study and will add it in a future version of this work . ( c ) We do not give enough evidence on how the order of the auto-regressive actions is chosen , though it could play a significant role for performance . In Platform-v0 this order is straightforward as the agent must first choose the action type and then the action intensity . In Google Football , while we found that enabling auto-regressivity was critical to achieve good performance , we also found that this choice does not impact the results in practice . Finally , we did not use an auto-regressive factorization of the action space for the MuJoCo benchmarks but an independent factorization instead ."}}
