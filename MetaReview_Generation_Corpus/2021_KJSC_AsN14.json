Thus , this conditional distribution is relatively stable , and can be used to supervise the conditional distribution of the associated strongly augmented views . In our experiments , we also found the DDM loss can stably converge at the same rate of the conventional contrastive loss , with the learned representation demonstrating competitive performance on downstream tasks . 2.In one of the previous works , InfoMin [ 1 ] studied the impact of different augmentations on the overall performance , which showed that the contrastive learning can be sensitive to the augmentations parameters . However , for the augmentations we used in experiments , we avoid this by randomly sampling various magnitudes of augmentations from a much broad range , including those resulting in much stronger augmentations . We did not carefully tune the strength of the resultant stronger augmentations , and we found the performance is insensitive to these sampled augmentations . This is unlike the method such as InfoMin [ 1 ] and AutoAugment [ 2 ] that tunes or searches for a specific level of augmentation strength for an optimal performance over a training/validation set . This makes the proposed CLSA more generalizable in adopting a wide range of stronger augmentations without relying on tedious tuning for a suitable strength . 3.Thank you for the suggestion ! Our main idea is to use the conditional distribution of weakly augmented views over negative examples to supervise that of strongly augmented views . This avoids a direct engagement of stronger augmentations in the minimization of contrastive loss that could deteriorate the performance as shown in our ablation study ( see Table 4 ) .

With 150 epochs , the CLSA-single only needs 52.5 hours , which is the same as MoCo v2 running for 200 epochs . In this case , the accuracy of CLSA-single is still higher than MoCo V2 with 68.3 % vs 67.5 % . Due to the time limit , we did not run the CLSA-single for 600 epochs that has a comparable running time for MoCo v2 over 800 epochs . But its accuracy should still be higher than MoCo v2 . 2.In experiments , we simply set the balancing coefficient to 1.0 , which is the most natural choice without any tuning over it . Although adjusting this hyper-parameter could further improve the performance , the proposed CLSA has already achieved very competitive results compared with the other models ."}}
