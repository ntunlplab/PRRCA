They design latent space interventions that yield hard examples ( which they claim should improve downstream model learning ) . They apply population based training on the latent-transformation-policy search ( which modifies the latent representation of a classification model directly ) , on top of training the classification model in question . The \u201c Hard example interpolation \u201d idea , i.e . : to interpolate towards the 5 % hardest examples , is interesting . As opposed to the search and latent aspects of the method , couldn \u2019 t this be the cause of any possible gains by the method ? A baseline experiment to check would be to use this interpolation method in input-level interpolation augmentations such as MixUp . The larger concern , however , is that it \u2019 s not clear what parts of the method yield good results . For instance , in order to make sure that the latent transformations are being applied in an approximately-gaussian latent , they apply adversarial loss on the latent , to enforce the gaussian prior .

For data augmentation , the paper presents 4 latent-space augmentation primitives by linear interpolation/extrapolation of feature vectors from the same class . For training objective , in addition to multi-class classification objective ( formulated as cross-entropy ) , it introduces two additional losses , such as triplet loss whose triplets are generated using ground-truth class labels and adversarial loss that regularizes feature distribution to be Gaussian . Comprehensive empirical study across multiple domains are presented . The paper demonstrates that the proposed method is particularly effective when the training data is limited . Pros : - Data augmentation became very important in deep learning and becomes a bottleneck when applying deep learning methods to problem domains with less prior knowledge on data . In this sense , the paper is tackling very important problem . - The paper demonstrates consistent performance improvement over baselines across multiple problem domains . - The presented methods sounds reasonable , though some clarifications are needed how they are evaluated ( see below ) . Cons/comments : - While domain-specific data augmentation methods , such as AutoAugment/RandAugment , are typically `` class '' agnostic , meaning that we do n't need to know the class labels of individual data , the presented method requires class label of individual data instances for augmentation . This could be a limitation of the proposed framework , as data augmentation methods become essential for semi-supervised and self-supervised learning methods . - Are PBA or L_ { tri } /L_ { adv } used for MixUp training ? Since MixUp training also involves hyperparameter ( mixing coefficient ) , it seems fair if mixing coefficient is tuned via PBA . Also , are `` w/o Aug '' in Table 1-3 using L_ { clf } only or L_ { clf } + L_ { tri } + L { adv } as training objective ? - Can MixUp be used as part of domain agnostic augmentation operations ? - One missing baseline is latent MixUp . - For PBA , how are validation sets formulated ? Is there a reason for other hyperparameters , such as margin , \\alpha and \\beta , validated separately ? - Figure 3 reminds me of center loss ( Wen et al. , A Discriminative Feature Learning Approach for Deep Face Recognition ) and large-margin softmax loss ( Liu et al. , Large-Margin Softmax Loss for Convolutional Neural Networks ) , which pointed out the problem of softmax loss and presented fixes . It would be instructive to discuss some potential of these losses combined with latent space augmentation proposed in this paper . Reason for rating : - I believe that the paper tackles an important bottleneck of ML algorithms to be useful in real-world . I tend to recommend for acceptance for initial rating . - However , there are several concerns that need to be clarified ( see Cons ) in empirical study of the work .

We have updated our submission accordingly . __Response to Cons 1__ : The class-agnostic perspective is inspiring . Indeed , this is also the case for most label-mixing augmentation methods , like Mixup and CutMix . For semi-supervised setting , the problem can be mitigated by introducing pseudo-labels . However , for self-supervised learning , we agree that it is a potential limitation . This can lead to future investigation of class-agnostic latent space transformation to assist self-supervised learning tasks for non-image modalities . __Response to Cons 2__ : $ L_ { tri } $ and $ L_ { adv } $ are not used for MixUP or PBA . As MixUp typically performs inter-class interpolation , the triplet loss may not be beneficial as it increases the separation between classes . As the original PBA method does not employ such losses , we keep their policy and apply it without $ L_ { tri } $ and $ L_ { adv } $ . Also , `` w/o Aug '' in Table 1-3 uses $ L_ { clf } $ only . We realize this may raise concerns about whether the performance gain is attributed to the additional losses or the latent space augmentation . In response to this , we have added a new ablation study in an attempt to isolate the effect from the additional loss terms in Table 5 of the latest revised version . It shows that data transformation in the latent space contributes to additional performance gain under different loss settings . __Response to Cons 3__ : The use of triplet loss intentionally promotes more compact local class regions for better inter-class transformation . MixUp , as an inter-class interpolation method , may generate data points far away from the data manifold . Therefore , we believe that MixUp may not be suitable for the current MODALS framework . One viable way is to replace the triplet loss by the consistency loss as a measure to preserve class identity . Then it allows MODALS to incorporate label-mixing augmentation , like MixUp , as a candidate latent space augmentation . __Response to Cons 4 : __ : Thanks for your suggestion . In text classification tasks , the senMixUp baseline is similar to latent MixUp . It applies MixUp to the latent sentence embedding . We also tried MixUp on the latent representations in tabular datasets . But we found that it does not work well for shallow model ( in our case a 2-layer MLP ) and small dataset size . __Response to Cons 5__ : The validation sets are formed following the setting in PBA , which takes half of the training data as the hold-out validation set . We intended to make the policy search comparable to the original PBA , such that both algorithms search for the probability and magnitude in applying augmentation operations . It is possible to add extra parameters $ \\alpha $ , $ \\beta $ and margin to the hyperparameter search procedure . However , if we allow the weights and margin to vary during training ( as it is a hyperparameter schedule search ) , it may lead to unstable training . __Response to Cons 6__ : Thank you for your suggestion . Both the center loss and the large margin loss are good alternatives to the triplet loss in MODALS . It can potentially be more efficient when the number of anchor pairs in the triplet loss is large . We have revised our submission to mention about using the center loss , large margin loss and other contrastive losses as viable alternatives of the triplet loss ."}, {"review_id": "XjYgR6gbCEc-2", "review_text": "This paper proposes a unified way to augment data in the latent ( embedding ) space .

Weakness : Reservations related to the usability of the proposed method : With the results presented in the paper , I am not convinced that the proposed technique will be preferred over other domain-specific data augmentation methods which leads me to question the usability of the proposed model . For example , one can simply use any pre-trained model as in [ Kumar et al.2020 ] or simply back-translation for text classification instead of the proposed data augmentation and can get much better results .

Also , MODALS is using a complex architecture that relies on end2end training so I do n't think that using a baseline that does n't require any kind of training is a fair comparison . - The claim that MODALS 's joint training for augmentation is different from previous approaches is not entirely true as the joint training for augmentation has been explored in past . Please refer to [ Mounsaveng et al.2019 , Hu et al.2019 ] and their citations . - Latent space augmentation has been studied extensively in both images and text classification literature .

For example , [ Kumar et al.2019 ] shows a comparison between different latent space augmentation techniques and shows that simply subtracting two sentence embeddings and adding it to the third embedding performs well for the text classification task . Questions : - For hard examples , authors use the difference between the prob of the most likely and the second most likely labels . How does it compare to the simple model confidence baseline where we select the examples for which model is not very confident ?

We provide an additional comparison with stronger text classification baselines . We have updated the submission to clarify the claim of contribution and implementation details of the discriminator . Your question about other latent space transformation techniques have led to valuable insights . __Response to Weakness 1__ : Instead of improving the model performance in a specific domain or modality , the focus ( and also novelty ) of this work is to propose a general automated data augmentation framework that can work for multiple data modalities in a generic way . To the best of our knowledge , such an attempt has not been made by others in the research community . We fully understand that taking this approach may not be able to outperform some data augmentations designed for a specific domain . Regarding back-translation , in response to your comment , we have implemented two more baselines using the Google Translate API for German and Spanish . Our experiment results show that MODALS is still a strong method in the SST2 and TREC6 classification tasks ( see Table 1 ) . We try to explain the edge of MODALS over off-the-shelf back-translation augmentation from several perspectives : 1 ) For domain-specific cases , like medical or legal documents , back-translation may not translate well as it may be pre-trained using data from different domains . 2 ) From the data availability perspective , back-translation models are typically exposed to a large text corpus . 3 ) Back-translation augmentation is deterministic . It is hard to control the degree of augmentation diversity from pre-built translation models . 4 ) We believe that MODALS can be applied jointly with back-translation to further improve the performance . For image data , we are investigating to apply MODALS with stronger baselines . We have found that applying the trained MODALS policy with trained PBA input-space policy can generate a 1.49 % accuracy gain in the reduced SVHN dataset over the original PBA method . Also , we agree that MODALS uses a relatively more complicated architecture to search for an optimal augmentation policy . We think that the end2end training effort is crucial to augmentation in datasets from new , less explored domains without much prior knowledge ( compared to some other baselines that are designed and validated for specific domains ) . For the domains that MODALS has been applied to , it is worth to investigate whether the previously searched policy can transfer well to other datasets from similar domains . For example , we search for an optimal policy in general ImageNet dataset and transfer or finetune the policy on downstream image classification tasks . This can potentially reduce the end2end training effort but is limited to explored domains . __Response to weakness 2__ : Thank you for pointing this out . We would like to clarify that such joint training is less explored in operation-based latent space transformation methods . We have revised our submission accordingly in the latest version . __Response to weakness 3__ : Thanks for making us aware of these relevant previous works . We added the work of [ Kumar et al.2019 ] as a related work in our latest submission . We understand that specific latent space transformations have been explored for image and text data . In [ Kumar et al.2019 ] , the addition and subtraction of sentence embeddings , called LINEAR , together with their proposed PERTURB and EXTRA methods , are roughly covered in our proposed difference transform , Gaussian noise , and hard example extrapolation . It is also observed that some operations perform better in some datasets but worse in others . We believe that combining different operation-based latent space transformations and searching for the optimal augmentation composition can lead to higher performance gain . __Response to question 1__ : Yes , in the ablation study , we used the margin measurement . We also tested the simple model confidence baseline and found that the trends and observations are similar . __Response to question 2__ : Thanks for pointing out it . The discriminator is implemented as a 2-Layer MLP model with 256 neurons in each layer with ReLU activations . We optimize the discriminator using the Adam optimizer with learning rate 0.01 .

From the perspective of injecting noise during training , MODALS , as an augmentation method , injects more types of noise ( 4 types of latent space transformation ) , while HDML mostly relies on inter-class extrapolation . Consequently , we speculate that MODALS can learn more robust representations . Nevertheless , we think it would be beneficial and viable to include such metric learning technique in MODALS as well .

Questions : - For hard examples , authors use the difference between the prob of the most likely and the second most likely labels . How does it compare to the simple model confidence baseline where we select the examples for which model is not very confident ? Have you done any experiments related to that ? - I am unable to find the implementation details of the discriminator model used in the experiments . Could you please add those details ?

Update after reading the response from the authors : I would like to thanks to authors for answering my questions and revising the draft . I agree that the main strength of this work is to explore data augmentation methods which are modality agnostic . Since most of the data augmentation research is domain specific , I think this paper will increase awareness for modality agnostic data augmentation methods . I think it 's a good paper , hence I am revising my score .", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "reply_text": "__Summary__ : Thank you for your suggestions . We provide an additional comparison with stronger text classification baselines . We have updated the submission to clarify the claim of contribution and implementation details of the discriminator . Your question about other latent space transformation techniques have led to valuable insights . __Response to Weakness 1__ : Instead of improving the model performance in a specific domain or modality , the focus ( and also novelty ) of this work is to propose a general automated data augmentation framework that can work for multiple data modalities in a generic way . To the best of our knowledge , such an attempt has not been made by others in the research community . We fully understand that taking this approach may not be able to outperform some data augmentations designed for a specific domain . Regarding back-translation , in response to your comment , we have implemented two more baselines using the Google Translate API for German and Spanish . Our experiment results show that MODALS is still a strong method in the SST2 and TREC6 classification tasks ( see Table 1 ) . We try to explain the edge of MODALS over off-the-shelf back-translation augmentation from several perspectives : 1 ) For domain-specific cases , like medical or legal documents , back-translation may not translate well as it may be pre-trained using data from different domains . 2 ) From the data availability perspective , back-translation models are typically exposed to a large text corpus . 3 ) Back-translation augmentation is deterministic . It is hard to control the degree of augmentation diversity from pre-built translation models . 4 ) We believe that MODALS can be applied jointly with back-translation to further improve the performance . For image data , we are investigating to apply MODALS with stronger baselines . We have found that applying the trained MODALS policy with trained PBA input-space policy can generate a 1.49 % accuracy gain in the reduced SVHN dataset over the original PBA method . Also , we agree that MODALS uses a relatively more complicated architecture to search for an optimal augmentation policy . We think that the end2end training effort is crucial to augmentation in datasets from new , less explored domains without much prior knowledge ( compared to some other baselines that are designed and validated for specific domains ) . For the domains that MODALS has been applied to , it is worth to investigate whether the previously searched policy can transfer well to other datasets from similar domains . For example , we search for an optimal policy in general ImageNet dataset and transfer or finetune the policy on downstream image classification tasks . This can potentially reduce the end2end training effort but is limited to explored domains . __Response to weakness 2__ : Thank you for pointing this out . We would like to clarify that such joint training is less explored in operation-based latent space transformation methods . We have revised our submission accordingly in the latest version . __Response to weakness 3__ : Thanks for making us aware of these relevant previous works . We added the work of [ Kumar et al.2019 ] as a related work in our latest submission . We understand that specific latent space transformations have been explored for image and text data . In [ Kumar et al.2019 ] , the addition and subtraction of sentence embeddings , called LINEAR , together with their proposed PERTURB and EXTRA methods , are roughly covered in our proposed difference transform , Gaussian noise , and hard example extrapolation . It is also observed that some operations perform better in some datasets but worse in others . We believe that combining different operation-based latent space transformations and searching for the optimal augmentation composition can lead to higher performance gain . __Response to question 1__ : Yes , in the ablation study , we used the margin measurement . We also tested the simple model confidence baseline and found that the trends and observations are similar . __Response to question 2__ : Thanks for pointing out it . The discriminator is implemented as a 2-Layer MLP model with 256 neurons in each layer with ReLU activations . We optimize the discriminator using the Adam optimizer with learning rate 0.01 . These are added to the latest revised version ."}, "3": {"review_id": "XjYgR6gbCEc-3", "review_text": "[ Summary ] This paper proposes a framework to apply automated augmentation in the latent space which is not restricted to any specific modality . The proposed method , called MODALS , follows the procedure of Population Based Augmentation approach and consists of two main parts : latent space transformation to generate harder examples and auxiliary adversarial loss & triplet loss to improve augmentation quality . MODALS is evaluated on multiple datasets for text , tabular , time-series and image modalities and achieves higher performance than competitors except on image data . [ Pros ] + The idea of augmenting data in latent space enables the framework to be generic for any modalities , which has a great potential in applications . + This paper is well organized and easy to follow . [ Cons ] - The proposed framework is interesting but somewhat incremental since most of the modules/losses are off-the-shelf . - The experimental settings seem not very fair and sufficient . 1.It would be better to equip all the competitors with the triplet loss and conduct the evaluation , to show how the data transformations ( Eq . ( 1-4 ) ) contributes to the learning . 2.The proposed method is very related to recent hardness aware metric learning method HDML [ 1 ] which also propose to manipulate data in latent space to generate hard examples . Could the proposed latent-space automated data augmentation method outperform such metric learning scheme ? - The use of adversarial loss might cause mode collapse , which is harmful for the data augmentation . How the proposed framework overcome this problem ? [ 1 ] Zheng W , Chen Z , Lu J , et al.Hardness-aware deep metric learning . CVPR.2019 : 72-81 .", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "__Summary__ : We have added one additional scenario to the ablation study to demonstrate how data transformation contributes to learning ( Table 5 ) . The additional comparison provides valuable insights for our method . __Response to Cons 1__ : We agree that most of the modules , like the triplet loss and adversarial loss , are existing methods . However , we would like to emphasize that the novelty of our work is to propose a general automated data augmentation framework that can work for multiple data modalities in a generic way . To the best of our knowledge , such an attempt has not been made by others in the research community . As such , the novelty is more on the general framework itself than on the specific techniques used in different components of the framework . __Response to Cons 2.1__ : Thanks for suggesting the comparison . We provide additional experiment results in Table 5 of the latest version . It shows that data transformation in the latent space contributes to additional performance gain under different loss settings . __Response to Cons 2.2__ : Thanks for making us aware of the latent space transformation method in deep metric learning research . Regarding the work of HDML [ 1 ] , we believe that our method and HDML are applied to different tasks . MODALS is applied to classification tasks while HDML is applied to retrieval and clustering tasks . It would be interesting to see if HDML can also be extended to classification tasks . From the perspective of injecting noise during training , MODALS , as an augmentation method , injects more types of noise ( 4 types of latent space transformation ) , while HDML mostly relies on inter-class extrapolation . Consequently , we speculate that MODALS can learn more robust representations . Nevertheless , we think it would be beneficial and viable to include such metric learning technique in MODALS as well . Inspired by HDML , one way to achieve it is to replace the triplet loss by a consistency loss to preserve the class identity and allow inter-class transformations . __Response to Cons 3__ : Empirically , we do not observe mode collapse as a severe issue in MODALS from the experiment results . However , in case some signs of mode collapse are indeed observed , one may reduce the weight $ \\alpha $ of the adversarial loss to mitigate the problem ."}}
