Due to the constructive nature of our proof , it is not easily generalized to the arbitrary associative and commutative binary operator , and we highly doubt that it will work in general . However , even without solid theoretical justification , we can implement generalized tensor networks with various nonlinearities and compare them empirically , which we do in Section B of the appendix . As we can see , the right choice of nonlinearity for particular dataset may lead to boost in the performance and it will be interesting direction of research to analyze them more rigorously from both theoretical and practical viewpoints . 2.Before introducing the concept of generalized tensor networks , we had full correspondence between the score functions of scalar product form ( equation 2 ) and the score functions of tensor decomposition form ( equations 6 and 8 ) . It ensures that tensor networks are universal function approximators and allows us to focus on another important properties , such as expressivity . However , after replacing the outer product with different operator and declaring the expressions from equations 14 and 16 to be the score functions , we can no longer state that they can be represented in a form of equation 2 .

Sure. What does that buy? Hierarchical Tucker (including Tensor Train) does indeed compute the standard Tucker mode representation of a tensor in an efficient manner using a set of sequential SVDs rather than using a single SVD per mode.

While previous results covered the multiplicative nonlinearity only, the contribution of the current paper is the extension of the analysis of universality and depth efficiency (Cohen et al, 2016) to different nonlinearities, for example ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), which is very important from the practical point of view. The paper is well written and have a good structure. However, I found that some deep concepts are not well introduced, and maybe other more trivial results are discussed with unnecessary details. The following comments could help authors to improve the quality of presentation of their paper: - Section 3.1 (Score Functions and Feature Tensor) is a bit short and difficult to read. o Maybe, a more motivating introduction could be included in order to justify the definition of score functions (eq. 2). o It would be also nice to state that, according to eq. (3), the feature tensor is a rank-1 tensor. o I would suggest moving the definition of outer product to the Appendix, since most readers know it very well. o It is said that eq. 2 possesses the universal approximation property (it can approximate any function with any prescribed precision given sufficiently large M). It is not clear which is the approximation function. - A Connection with Tensor-Ring (TR) format, if possible, could be helpful: It is known that TR format (Zhao et al, 2016, arXiv:1606.05535), which is obtained by connecting the first and last units in a TT model, helps to alleviate the requirement of large ranks in the first and last the core tensors of a TT model reaching to a decomposition with an evenly distributed rank bounds. I think, it would be interesting to make a connection of RNN to TR because the assumption of R_i < R for all i becomes more natural. I would like to see at least some comment from the authors about the applicability of TR in the context of analysis of RNN, if possible. Maybe, also the initial hidden state defined in page 5 can be avoided if TR is used instead of TT. - Fig 2 shows that Test accuracy of a shallow network (CP based) is lower and increases with the number of parameters approaching to the one for RNN (TT based). It would be necessary to show the results for an extended range in the number of parameters, for example, by plotting the results up to 10^6. It is expected that, at some point, the effect of overfitting start decreasing the test accuracy. - When scores functions are presented (eq. 2) it is written the term \"logits\" between brackets. Could you please clarify why this term is introduced here? Usually, logit of a probability p is defined as L(p)=p/(1-p). What is the usage of this term in this work? - I think the theory is presented for a model with the two-classes only but used for multiple classes in the experimental sections. It should be necessary to make some comment about this in the paper. - Details about how the RNN based on TT is applied must be added. More specifically, the authors should provide answers to clarify the following questions: (i) Are patches overlapped or non-overlapped? (ii) What value of M is used? and is there any general rule for this choice? (iii) How the classification in the 10-classes is obtained? Are you using a softmax function in the last layer? Are you using one weight tensor W_c per class (c=1,2,...,10). Please provide these technical details. (iv) Please, specify which nonlinear activation sigma is used in the feature map f_\\theta(x).

In particular , incorporating the circular dimensional permutation invariance property into neural networks may provide insights into how to design new types of RNNs .
