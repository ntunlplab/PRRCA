The reviewers raise several issues in their reviews.

The experimental results were not significant enough, and the reviewers also recommend additional experiment results to clearly demonstrate the benefit of the method.

The key contribution is that the discriminator not only predicts the probability of an image being real or fake, but also outputs a map which indicates where the generator should focus in the next iteration in order to make its results more convincing. The paper explores ways of obtaining such a map 1) by summing feature activations of the discriminator on a specific or group of layers 2) by predicting it via augmenting the capacity of the discriminator. After such a map is obtained, it is concatenated with the input image and fed iteratively to the generator. The proposed setting have been tested on the setting of supervised and unsupervised image translation on 4 datasets. Quantitative experiments show that the proposed approach improves over other baselines. I think this paper introduces an interesting and important new GAN framework.

Why the quantitative results are evaluated on the Cityscape? How about FID on other datasets such as CelebA and Summer2Winter, or higher-resolution data? - The quantitative scores are not impressive.

The novelty of our framework is trying to let D provides more information since D is usually more powerful than G in practice . We were using attention mechanism to expose such extra information from D , and using this information to boost the performance of the generator ; ( 2 ) .

However , the improvement over unsupervised I2I translation is significant . As stated in Answer ( 2 ) , we will add some KID/FID scores in the revision .

Basically , our unsupervised I2I model is based on the official implementation of CycleGAN and the supervised version is built upon the pix2pix 's official implementation . We did n't change G 's architecture , except the input channel is 4 when using RGBA concatenation . For the post hoc attention , we did n't change D 's architecture . For the trainable attention module , the modified discriminator ( with mask & trunk branch ) is powerful than the original one in the CycleGAN/pix2pix . We tried to replace the original discriminator with this modified D. But the performance of G decreases so we stay with the original one .

The motivation is that the discriminator is usually too powerful, and so the gradient the generator receives is often too small in magnitude. By conditioning on the attention map, the generator could leverage information about the regions in the image that the discriminator attends to and use it to generate a new image that better fools the discriminator. My main concern is about whether the proposed extension achieves the desired goal. The intuitive motivation provided in the paper aims to add a cooperative component to the two-player game, but the min-max objective corresponds to a zero-sum adversarial game. As a result, when training the discriminator, the discriminator is encouraged to reveal as little information as possible via the attention map, so that the loss maximized. This appears to be the opposite of the desired behavior, so the objective needs to be reformulated. Also, it is unclear how inference is performed: at test time, the attention map is unknown and so some placeholder must be used in its place. The paper should clarify what is done at test time, and clearly state the shortcomings as a result of this, i.e. different procedures are used for training and testing, which is not principled. I imagine the generator could rely too much on the attention map as a result - how this is alleviated/prevented should be explained. Figure 2: Only the qualitative results for unsupervised image-to-image translation are available; qualitative results for supervised image-to-image translation should also be provided. While the quantitative improvement over existing methods is somewhat insignificant, I appreciate the authors discussing their hypotheses why this might be the case. It would be more useful to empirically validate these hypotheses as well. For example, for the claim that \"maybe the attention map only focuses on a few domain specific classes so the generator works too hard on those classes and ignores others\", it might be good to compute the average per-class attention map intensity to show that some classes appear rarely in the attention map. The evaluation protocol should be explained in greater detail (perhaps in the appendix); the segmentation model (which I assume is FCN) should be described and each of the evaluation metrics (per-pixel acc., per-class acc. and IoU) should be described for the benefit of researchers outside the area. pg. 4: \"in their implementation contains several Resblock (He et al., 2016), which makes it infeasible in our framework\".

For the post hoc attention , we did n't change D 's architecture since only the activation of a specific layer is required . For the trainable attention module , the modified discriminator ( with mask & trunk branch ) is powerful than the original one in the CycleGAN/pix2pix . We tried to replace the original discriminator with this modified D. But the performance of G decreases so we stay with the original one . This is expected because a more powerful D will further break the equilibrium between G and D. Both UNIT and StarGAN are more complex than CycleGAN so we think all of the baselines are comparable ; ( 8 ) . The confusing long sentence about RAM . We will rewrite this part and refer the reader to the appendix in the revision . ( 9 ) .Attention mask can potentially break good property of the raw input . Suppose $ x $ is the input image and $ A_x $ is the attention map of it . We know that all the elements in $ A_x $ are in [ 0 , 1 ] . Using $ X \\times A_x $ instead of $ x \\times ( 1 + A_x ) $ will decrease the value in the original image , and sometimes results in zero . However , 1 ) An attention map highlights important regions from the perspective of D. But a pixel with attention value 0 does n't mean it 's useless for the image translation task . By using residual multiplication , we give G the opportunity to bypass the effect of the soft attention mask . 2 ) . $ A_x $ is supposed to amplify the signal of the corresponding pixel ; ( 10 ) Typos and other issues will be fixed in the future revision ;"}}
