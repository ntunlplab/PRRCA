First, all the experiments are conducted on toy symbolic datasets, where the alignment problem is rather easy to solve. On the other hand, real-world scenarios can be far more complicated. For example, the appearance of the same object can change due to lighting and distance, and it is unreasonable to assume that their features would remain static (apart from simple uniform noises). In addition, the paper only compares against hand-crafted similarity measures (MSE and cosine). It is unfair to compare learned methods only to hand-crafted methods. As a reasonable and fair comparison, the paper should also compare AlignNet against learned similarity measures (such as a neural network supervised with ground-truth labels for alignments).

Results shows that the proposed approach is better than hand-crafted features on different simulated tasks. Additionally the propose model is shown to help to reduce the computational cost for question answering task. I lean to reject this paper because in my opinion the proposed method is just a set of predefined rules to train a network to be able to perform object association between a new time step and a memory. Additionally the experimental evaluation is very weak in several points (see below). - Contribution: this approach proposes a set of rules to train a network to be able to learn the correct association between two set of features. Additionally, the network is used together with a memory to keep track of previously seen objects. In my understanding the proposed work presents a set of hard-coded rules to train a network for tracking. However, the connection with tracking is presented only in related works (at the end of the paper) and no comparison with other tracking approach is presented. Additionally, the network model that is actually used for the experiments (graph network) is not presented in the main paper, which makes more difficult to understand how the network works for the given task. - Experimental evaluation: Experiments are performed on a very simple, simulated environment. Objects are very simple to recognize and their location (which is often a difficult component of the problem) is given. As the task is quite straight forward, the model obtains almost 100% on all tests. Comparisons are made only with hand-crafted features. It is quite evident that a learned similarity measure will be better than hand-crafted distances. Authors should explain more clearly that the proposed contribution is a set of rules used to learn a distance between features in order to associate object instances. A cleared connection with tracking should be provided from the introduction. In the evaluation there should be a comparison on multiple and more challenging tracking datasets.
