The goal of the paper is very interesting, and the motivation clear. This paper tackles a very important issue with recent unsupervised feature learning methods.\nHowever, while the goal is great, the present submission does not provide time improvements on par with the ambitions of this work. As noted by R2, many other hacks could be used in conjunction with the current work to scale this goal to the extreme, yielding time improvements which would be of a more impressive magnitude. In its current form, this paper unfortunately doesn\u2019t meet the bar of acceptance.\nGiven the interesting scope of this work, I strongly encourage the authors to take the feedback from reviews and discussions into account and submit to another venue.", "reviews": [{"review_id": "Y3pk2JxYmO-0", "review_text": "In this submission the authors suggest modifications to reduce the computational cost of contrastive learning .

The two key ideas are to back-prop only through a subset of layers in the network ( from a random layer , back to the input ) , and to drop training instances which are not `` hard '' ( in a way defined more precisely in the paper ) . By combining these techniques the paper shows that pre-training time can be reduced by ~30 % without significant loss in performance on downstream tasks . The proposed acceleration techniques are evaluated on multiple contrastive learning methods ( SimCLR v1 , MoCo v2 , SwAV ) and for multiple downstream tasks ( image classification , segmentation , and object detection ) . The experiments convincingly demonstrate that the accelerated approach works well when pre-training for a relatively small number of epochs . My main criticism is that the performance values reported in the paper do not always match what is reported in the literature . Presumably this is because the amount of pre-training is less than what was done in previous work . For example , SwAV reports achieving 75.3 top-1 on ImageNet with linear classification , while Table 1 in the paper only reports 70.1 . Although the acceleration approach works well early in training , it is not clear whether the same benefits play out when one aims to achieve performance on par with that reported in the literature . More ( longer ) experiments are required to support this claim . One would expect that , eventually , the approximation techniques introduced to speed up training , may have a negative effect on the ultimate performance . It would be useful to know at what point in training ( or at what scale ) this becomes apparent . And if it is not the case that the approximation techniques cause any loss in performance , it would be nice to have some deeper understanding of why that 's the case . The claim that the proposed approach reduces the ( average ) memory usage during training is accurate , although it should be clarified that this is the _average_ memory usage . The peak memory usage still occurs when all layers are used to produce the representation , and this is no different than the peak memory usage of standard methods . Anyways , I guess the main message is about reduction in training time , and memory savings could be down-played . Fine-tuning the full architecture generally performs much better than just linear evaluation for image classification . Did you also investigate the performance of methods using fine-tuning ?

A useful consquence of this paper is making contrastive unsupervised learning on ImageNet more accessible to people with less computation resources , ex PhD students in academic labs who may not have a DGX-1 or v3-TPU pods . Pros : Tackles an important problem - how can we make self-supervised learning even faster with clever engineering Delivers on the problem by proposing two sensible solutions - saving the cost of backprop by using intermediate layers for contrastive losses , and also better negative mining while doing the fprop in a computationally efficient manner . Good results in terms of time to accuracy on linear classifier - both with MoCo and SimCLR - two leading instance contrastive learning approaches . Cons : No code release as of yet . I believe the utility value of engineering driven papers is high but heavily relies of clean open source code that 's usable by the community . No results with fewer GPUs . If you can get results faster but still use 8 GPUs ( though I do notice you have used 12 GB memory Titan V as opposed to 16 Gb memory GPUs used by MoCo , I do n't think that 's a deal breaker since MoCo ResNet-50s can be trained with the same HBM too ) . I think what 's more important is to show you need fewer GPUs - can someone with a single GPU get results with the same amount of compute-time taken by Facebook to get MoCo 's results .. That 's what really increases accessibility to folks with less compute IMHO . Reducing time to accuracy could be done in a host of other ways - eg - make everything run in fp16 or bfloat16 on the right kind of hardware - you would see a speedup of ~1.3x already . Use smaller image sizes while training , eg - instead of 224x224 , use 192x192 , use different temperatures ( tune hyperparams ) for training within as few epochs as possible . Use less unlabeled data to get the same accuracy . All these are orthogonal to your proposed method ofc , so not trying to compare them with yours . My point is that - why not push the broader goal to the extreme - can one combine all these engineering tricks in one piece , and design a way faster contrastive learning pipeline that can train with way less resources and still perform as well in much less wall clock time .. The Related work section can be improved - example , Contrastive Learning prior work should mention the CPCv2 work ( Henaff et al 2019 ) ; and the idea of using intermediate layers and backprop . the losses through them should mention the Inception architecture ( Szegedy et al.2015 ) as well as Deep Classification work that did this few years ago for supervised learning .

If you can get results faster but still use 8 GPUs ( though I do notice you have used 12 GB memory Titan V as opposed to 16 Gb memory GPUs used by MoCo , I do n't think that 's a deal breaker since MoCo ResNet-50s can be trained with the same HBM too ) . I think what 's more important is to show you need fewer GPUs - can someone with a single GPU get results with the same amount of compute-time taken by Facebook to get MoCo 's results .. That 's what really increases accessibility to folks with less compute IMHO . Reducing time to accuracy could be done in a host of other ways - eg - make everything run in fp16 or bfloat16 on the right kind of hardware - you would see a speedup of ~1.3x already . Use smaller image sizes while training , eg - instead of 224x224 , use 192x192 , use different temperatures ( tune hyperparams ) for training within as few epochs as possible . Use less unlabeled data to get the same accuracy . All these are orthogonal to your proposed method ofc , so not trying to compare them with yours . My point is that - why not push the broader goal to the extreme - can one combine all these engineering tricks in one piece , and design a way faster contrastive learning pipeline that can train with way less resources and still perform as well in much less wall clock time .. The Related work section can be improved - example , Contrastive Learning prior work should mention the CPCv2 work ( Henaff et al 2019 ) ; and the idea of using intermediate layers and backprop . the losses through them should mention the Inception architecture ( Szegedy et al.2015 ) as well as Deep Classification work that did this few years ago for supervised learning . Rating : Weak Reject - I would be open to reconsidering this if the authors commit to releasing their code , and also performing some benchmarking with respect to number of GPUs , and revising related work . I also encourage the authors to push further on making their pipeline even more efficient .", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We thank reviewer # 2 for the feedback ! \u201c releasing code \u201d -- We promise to release the code . Here is the link to our current implementation of simCLR : [ https : //drive.google.com/drive/folders/1r0v4niEjotLsuVqbx9vw7qCKuCUms08w ? usp=sharing ] . The implementation is based on an open-source library OpenSelfSup . We will further clean the code and release the other parts . \u201c related work \u201d -- Thanks for your advice . We have added more discussion about these related works , including CPCv2 , deep cluster and some other work for self-supervised learning , and Inception Net and DARTs for intermediate losses . \u201c more ablation and extremely accelerating \u201d -- Thanks for your advice . We view the extremely accelerating models as future work . We have already tried some of the approaches you mentioned , but have not found universal improvement . For example , we found that reducing image resolution from 224x224 to 192x192 during training hurts the performance of MOCO and MOCO V2 . We show the results in appendix B.4 . We will study more in future work ."}}
