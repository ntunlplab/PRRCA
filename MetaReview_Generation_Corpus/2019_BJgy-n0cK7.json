Semantic segmentation is typically performed over single images, while there is un-used redundancy between neighbouring frames. The authors propose exploiting this redundancy and leverage block motion vectors from MPEG H.264 video codec which encodes residual content between keyframes. The block motion vectors from H264 are here used to propagate feature maps from keyframes to neighbouring non-keyframe frames (in both temporal directions) avoiding thus an additional full forward pass through the network and integrate this in the training pipeline. Experimental results on CamVid and Cityscapes show that the proposed method gets competitive results while saving computational time. # Paper strengths - This paper addresses a problem of interest for both academic and industrial purposes. - The paper is clearly written and the authors argument well their contributions, adding relevant plots and qualitative results where necessary. - The two-way interpolation with block motion vectors and the fusion of interpolated features are novel and seem effective. - The experimental results, in particular for the two-way BMV interpolation, are encouraging. # Paper weaknesses - The idea of using Block Motion Vectors from compressed videos (x264, xvid) to capture motion with low-cost has been previously proposed and studied by Kantorov and Laptev [i] in the context of human action recognition. Flow vectors are obtained with bilinear interpolation from motion blocks between neighbouring frames. Vectors are then encoded in Fisher vectors and not used with CNNs as done in this paper. In both works, block motion vectors are used as low-cost alternatives to dense optical flow. I would suggest to cite this work and discuss similarities and differences. - Regarding the evaluation of the method, some recent methods dealing with video semantic segmentation, also using ResNet101 as backbone, are missing, e.g. low latency video semantic segmentation[ii]. Pioneer Clockwork convnets are also a worthy baseline in particular in terms of computational time (results and running times on CityScapes are shown in [ii]). It would be useful to include and compare against them. - In Section 4.1.2 page 7 the authors mention a few recent single-frame models ((Yu et al. (2017); Chen et al. (2017); Lin et al. (2017); Bilinski & Prisacariu (2018)) as SOTA methods and the current method is competitive with them. However I do not see the results from the mentioned papers in the referenced Figures. Is this intended? - On a more general note related to this family of approaches, I feel that their evaluation is usually not fully eloquent. Authors compare against similar pipelines for static processing and show gains in terms of computation time. The backbone architecture, ResNet-101 is already costly for high-resolution inputs to begin with and avoiding a full-forward pass brings quite some gains (though a part of this gain is subsequently attenuated by the latency caused by the batch processing of the videos). There are recent works in semantic segmentation that focus on architectures with less FLOPs or memory requirements than ResNet101, e.g. Dilated ResNets [iii], LinkNet[iv]. So it could be expected that image-based pipelines to be getting similar or better performance in less time. I expect the computational gain on such architectures when using the proposed video processing method to be lower than for ResNet101, and it would make the decision of switching to video processing or staying with frame-based predictions more complex. The advantage of static image processing is simpler processing pipelines at test time without extra parameters to tune. It would be interesting and useful to compare with such approaches on more even grounds. # Conclusion This paper takes on an interesting problem and achieves interesting results. The use of Block Motion Vectors has been proposed before in [i] and the main novelty of the paper remains only the interpolation of feature maps using BMVC. The experimental section is missing some recent related methods to benchmark against. This work has several strong and weak points. I'm currently on the fence regarding my decision.

While Kantorov and Laptev do explore MPEG block motion vectors , they do so in a very different context , treating motion vectors as low-level video features ( \u201c descriptors \u201d ) to learn more effectively on video .

Unlike these works , our main focus is not efficient training , nor reducing the physical size of input data to strengthen the underlying signal for video-level tasks , such as action recognition. \u201d In contrast , we center our efforts on efficient , frame-level inference ( Sec.2.3 cont \u2019 d ) : \u201c We instead focus on a class of dense prediction tasks , notably semantic segmentation , that involve high- dimensional output ( e.g.a class prediction for every pixel in an image ) generated on the original uncompressed frames of a video . This means that we must still process each frame in isolation .

( 3 ) We describe our task network as follows ( Sec.3.1 , p. 3 ) : \u201c We identify two logical components in our final model : a feature network , which takes as input an image i \u2208 R^ { 1\u00d73\u00d7h\u00d7w } and outputs a representation f_i \u2208 R^ { 1\u00d7A\u00d7h/16\u00d7w/16 } , and a task network , which given the representation , computes class predictions for each pixel in the image , p_i \u2208 R^ { 1\u00d7C\u00d7h\u00d7w } . The task network N_task is built by concatenating three blocks : ( 1 ) a feature projection block , which reduces the feature channel dimensionality to A/2 , ( 2 ) a scoring block , which predicts scores for each of the C segmentation classes , and ( 3 ) an upsampling block , which bilinearly upsamples the score maps to the resolution of the input image. \u201d We used the DeepLab segmentation architecture ( Chen et al.2017 ) , so we omitted further details about the task network , provided here : ( 1 ) Feature projection block - R^ { 1\u00d7A\u00d7h/16\u00d7w/16 } - > R^ { 1\u00d7A/2\u00d7h/16\u00d7w/16 } ( 2 ) Scoring block - R^ { 1\u00d7A/2\u00d7h/16\u00d7w/16 } - > R^ { 1\u00d7C\u00d7h/16\u00d7w/16 } ( 3 ) Upsampling block - R^ { 1\u00d7C\u00d7h/16\u00d7w/16 } - > R^ { 1\u00d7C\u00d7h\u00d7w } Regarding Algorithm 2 in the Appendix , good catch ! Line 8 should read f_ { k+n } \u2190 N_ { feat } ( I_ { k+n } ) NOT f_ { k+n } \u2190 N_ { feat } ( F_ { k+n } ) where I_ { k+n } refers to the k+n-th frame in the video . We will correct this in our revision . Thanks a lot once again for your comments . We look forward to your response !"}, "2": {"review_id": "BJgy-n0cK7-2", "review_text": "# Paper summary This paper advances a method for accelerating semantic segmentation on video content at higher resolutions. Semantic segmentation is typically performed over single images, while there is un-used redundancy between neighbouring frames. The authors propose exploiting this redundancy and leverage block motion vectors from MPEG H.264 video codec which encodes residual content between keyframes. The block motion vectors from H264 are here used to propagate feature maps from keyframes to neighbouring non-keyframe frames (in both temporal directions) avoiding thus an additional full forward pass through the network and integrate this in the training pipeline. Experimental results on CamVid and Cityscapes show that the proposed method gets competitive results while saving computational time. # Paper strengths - This paper addresses a problem of interest for both academic and industrial purposes. - The paper is clearly written and the authors argument well their contributions, adding relevant plots and qualitative results where necessary. - The two-way interpolation with block motion vectors and the fusion of interpolated features are novel and seem effective. - The experimental results, in particular for the two-way BMV interpolation, are encouraging. # Paper weaknesses - The idea of using Block Motion Vectors from compressed videos (x264, xvid) to capture motion with low-cost has been previously proposed and studied by Kantorov and Laptev [i] in the context of human action recognition. Flow vectors are obtained with bilinear interpolation from motion blocks between neighbouring frames. Vectors are then encoded in Fisher vectors and not used with CNNs as done in this paper. In both works, block motion vectors are used as low-cost alternatives to dense optical flow. I would suggest to cite this work and discuss similarities and differences. - Regarding the evaluation of the method, some recent methods dealing with video semantic segmentation, also using ResNet101 as backbone, are missing, e.g. low latency video semantic segmentation[ii]. Pioneer Clockwork convnets are also a worthy baseline in particular in terms of computational time (results and running times on CityScapes are shown in [ii]). It would be useful to include and compare against them. - In Section 4.1.2 page 7 the authors mention a few recent single-frame models ((Yu et al. (2017); Chen et al. (2017); Lin et al. (2017); Bilinski & Prisacariu (2018)) as SOTA methods and the current method is competitive with them. However I do not see the results from the mentioned papers in the referenced Figures. Is this intended? - On a more general note related to this family of approaches, I feel that their evaluation is usually not fully eloquent. Authors compare against similar pipelines for static processing and show gains in terms of computation time. The backbone architecture, ResNet-101 is already costly for high-resolution inputs to begin with and avoiding a full-forward pass brings quite some gains (though a part of this gain is subsequently attenuated by the latency caused by the batch processing of the videos). There are recent works in semantic segmentation that focus on architectures with less FLOPs or memory requirements than ResNet101, e.g. Dilated ResNets [iii], LinkNet[iv]. So it could be expected that image-based pipelines to be getting similar or better performance in less time. I expect the computational gain on such architectures when using the proposed video processing method to be lower than for ResNet101, and it would make the decision of switching to video processing or staying with frame-based predictions more complex. The advantage of static image processing is simpler processing pipelines at test time without extra parameters to tune. It would be interesting and useful to compare with such approaches on more even grounds. # Conclusion This paper takes on an interesting problem and achieves interesting results. The use of Block Motion Vectors has been proposed before in [i] and the main novelty of the paper remains only the interpolation of feature maps using BMVC. The experimental section is missing some recent related methods to benchmark against. This work has several strong and weak points. I'm currently on the fence regarding my decision. For now I'm rating this work between Weak Reject and Borderline # References [i] V. Kantorov and I.

( 1 ) Thanks for pointing our attention to Kantorov and Laptev 2014 . While Kantorov and Laptev do explore MPEG block motion vectors , they do so in a very different context , treating motion vectors as low-level video features ( \u201c descriptors \u201d ) to learn more effectively on video . This is a very similar idea to that proposed in CoViAR [ i ] , which trains directly on video I-frames , motion vectors , and residuals ( also in the context of action recognition ) . CoViAR ( Wu et al.2018 ) is cited and discussed in our paper ( Sec.2.3 ) : \u201c Wu et al . ( 2018 ) train a network directly on compressed video to improve both accuracy and performance on video action recognition ... Unlike these works , our main focus is not efficient training , nor reducing the physical size of input data to strengthen the underlying signal for video-level tasks , such as action recognition. \u201d In contrast , we center our efforts on efficient , frame-level inference ( Sec.2.3 cont \u2019 d ) : \u201c We instead focus on a class of dense prediction tasks , notably semantic segmentation , that involve high- dimensional output ( e.g.a class prediction for every pixel in an image ) generated on the original uncompressed frames of a video . This means that we must still process each frame in isolation . To the best of our knowledge , we are the first to propose the use of compressed video artifacts to warp deep neural representations , with the goal of ... improved inference throughput on realistic video. \u201d We will add a citation to Kantorov and Laptev 2014 in our paper revision .
