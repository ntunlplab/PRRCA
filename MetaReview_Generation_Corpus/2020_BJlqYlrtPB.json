They propose several measures based on this model to distinguish between inliers and outliers, and evaluate the model empirically, finding it successful. Unfortunately, the method in this paper is developed unclearly and incorrectly. Although their experiments are somewhat successful, the problems with the text and method are severe enough to justify rejection. Specifically, the authors' method proposes adding a term to the loss of the VAE that encourages the variational posterior (q) to distribute latent codes (z) for inliers and outliers differently. The equation which defines their new objective is unclear -- specifically, it is not clear whether the added KL term is computed for inliers and outliers both, or whether it is only computed for outliers. If it is the former, then the method does not make sense. If it is the latter, then the equation is incorrect or at the very least not clear in the extreme. Furthermore, the term is added without consideration of whether or not the method is still optimizing a sensible variational lower bound. The authors attempt to justify the objective by writing out a variational lower bound for a VAE with a mixture prior where inliers and outliers are generated from different mixture components. However, their equations are incorrect -- the equation that is called the log likelihood is not the log likelihood, and the ELBO is similarly wrong. Their empirical evaluation is reasonable, although the measures they propose to distinguish between inliers and outliers (i.e. the kl from the approximate posterior to the prior) is not thoroughly justified.

The idea is to train the encoder such that its output variational distribution q(z|\\bar{x}) is pushed away from the prior of latent z. I think the paper needs more clarification and investigation for being published in the conference. My major concern is that more empirical investigation is necessary since the formulation provides a minor novelty. Specific points are given below. 1) Weak novelty in terms of model design. The objective function consists of the standard (negative) ELBO term and additional KL term to modify the variational posterior of negative samples. This modification can be regarded as a form of outlier exposure (Hendrycks et al. 2018) specialized for VAE. The choice of \\bar{p} is not much investigated. Any discussion if we use a more sophisticated model such as VampPrior* for stronger modeling capacity. * J. Tomczak and M. Welling, VAE with a VampPrior, AISTATS 2018. 2) The use generated samples as negative samples is interesting but mysterious. The authors conjecture that this works because the generated samples come from near the data manifold, but in-distribution samples and negative samples can be indistinguishable when the generative model is very well trained. What happens if, for example, the negative samples are generated by data augmentation techniques (such as cropping, rotation, mirroring, though mirroring and much rotation may be unsuitable for text images)? This can also produce near-manifold points. A deeper analysis why generated samples can improve the OOD detection performance is necessary. Furthermore, why does not this approach impact much for color images in Table 4? 3) More details of experimental procedures. 3-1) How was data points are generated from VAE as negative samples? Possible ways are: * sample z ~ p(z), then draw from the decoder x ~ p(x|z). * use negative prior z ~ \\bar{p}(z), then draw from the decoder x ~ p(x|z). * this seems weird: use variational posterior z ~ q(z|x), then x ~ p(x|z). 3-2) Latent dimension of 10 for grayscale images seems small. Does the size affect the OOD detection performance when the size is 50 or 100 to make the model richer. 3-3) How was the variance obtained when the decoder uses the Gaussian likelihood? * fixed value? * learned for each pixel? * output from the decoder? 4) If we have access to diverse negative datasets, can the ODD detection perform better? Mixing multiple datasets or using both available dataset and generated samples can improve the performance while the test OOD samples are kept unseen. For example, train VAE on MNIST while using KMNIST and EMNIST as the negative sets to detect Fashion-MNIST as ODD.

It is a question of future research how best to adapt our approach to other likelihood-based models . 2 ) We have added a section in the paper that discusses this question , titled `` why using generated data as negative samples could help ? `` . To summarize : - Regarding the argument regarding a fully trained model , in practice , true data samples and generated samples can be distinguished even for fully trained models . But even assuming a perfect generator at convergence , during the training process the generated samples might still help to guide the model toward an equilibrium that promotes a lower likelihood for OOD samples . - Regarding data augmentation as a source of negative samples : If the augmentation actually keeps the samples within the true data manifold , then distinguishing between true and augmented data is something that we might not want to promote . The encoder would probably learn specific minor visual clues ( e.g.bilinear filtering artifacts for rotations ) that do not usually help assigning lower likelihood to OOD samples . - Regarding the performance of our models on color images : in the updated version of the paper we have tuned our color image models by using spectral normalization layers in the encoder . This change significantly improved the AUC values ( e.g. , from 0.53 to 0.85 ) for the models using generated negative samples , but did not improve the AUC values of the baseline models . 3-1 ) We employed the first option , sampling from the positive prior .
