The idea is to include short actions sequences as labels (in addition to the basic actions) in imitation learning.  Results on a few Atari games demonstrate the potential of this approach.\n\nReviewers generally like the idea, think it is simple, and are encouraged by its empirical support.  That said, the work still appears somewhat preliminary in the current stage: (1) some reviewer is still in doubt about the chosen baseline; (2) empirical evidence is all in the similar set of Atari games --- how broadly is this approach applicable?", "reviews": [{"review_id": "HJfxbhR9KQ-0", "review_text": "[Summary] This paper presents an interesting idea that to append the agent's action space with the expert's most frequent action pairs, by which the agent can perform better exploration as to achieve the same performance in a shorter time.

However, no ablation studies are performed to demonstrate the sensitivity of the selected hyperparameters. Although the authors claim that \"we limit the size of meta-actions k to 2 because large action spaces may lead to poor convergence\", a more systematic evaluation is needed. How will the performance change if we add more and longer action sequences? When will the performance reach a plateau? How does it vary between different environments? - Analysis of the selected action sequences. It might be better to add more analysis of the selected action sequences. What are the most frequent action pairs? How does it differ from game to game? What if the action pairs are selected in a random fashion? - Justification of the motivation The major motivation of the method is to release the burden of memory overheads. However, no quantitative evaluations are provided as to justify the claim.

It could be argued that it's not using all of the training outcome, but have the authors considered other form of experts and see how that works? 2.

Q2.The memory advantage of our approach is quite straight forward . Out of all imitation baseline , only our method does not need to store state information at all . We only need few action sequences for ~25 episodes ( each with a few 1000 integers ) which takes trivially low memory .

Please note that each state is an image is originally 210 * 160 * 3 dimensional . Q3.As we understand , you \u2019 re concerned about difference in variance when we plot episode-wise and time-wise .
