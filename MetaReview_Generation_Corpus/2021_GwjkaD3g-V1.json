Although synthetic experiments are common in the field , I see this as a weakness because the method heavily relies on image reconstruction loss on rendered objects . Real scene are very different due to both high level ( more clutter , occlusion , number of objects ) and low level ( shading , less predicable texture ) differences from the examples used in the synthetic experiments and will likely require different constraints to solve . The model has access to dense ground truth depth maps too , which is difficult to obtain . The motivation for self-supervised learning is to take advantage of unlabeled in-the-wild images , so considering all of those things , I think the synthetic RGB-D assumption hurts this paper more than an average paper . - There 's much to learn from the object count experiment ( Table 1 and Page 6 ) , but I found the results confusing . According to Page 5 which says `` each dataset contains scenes with a specific number of objects which we choose from two to five '' , the network was trained to model a specific number of objects separately in each experiment . If you evaluate a three-object trained network on images containing two objects ( `` obj=3/2 '' in Table 1 , 10th row ) , one would expect it to suffer from false positives , but the quantitative results do not show this . The results are almost the same as `` obj=3/3 '' . Why is this ? Did it learn to solve this problem , or were they somehow not included in the evaluation ? I think there 's some resemblance to EM , and it would matter a lot if you knew the number of true clusters beforehand , and how over or under-estimations are handled , in understanding the model 's behavior . - Lack of basic baselines . Currently there 's no way to know how difficult this dataset is , and how well a fully supervised model would perform . - Potentially missing details , additional questions , and suggestions : - In RGB reconstruction loss and evaluation , do you also count the background , or is this on ground truth object region only ? - Page 2 says `` By representing 3D geometry explicitly , our approach naturally respects occlusions and collisions between objects and facilitates manipulation of the scene within the latent space . '' This part was confusing to me . How does it avoid collision of objects in 3D ? My understanding is that this is not part of equation 1 . - Figure 2 is confusing . I think a few captions in the image would have helped a lot . - In Table 2 , would you attribute the gap between seen and unseen instances more to the shape , or the texture of the object ? - One suggestion is , would you be able to render the scene from a novel viewpoint , since you know the depth , shape and pose of each object ? And then evaluate against ground truth rendering from that viewpoint ? Being able to do such an experiment could make the synthetic setting more useful . # # # Strengths - Ablation study in Table 1 shows that all of the loss terms are important . This justifies the design and I would consider it an insightful discovery . For example , the ground truth depth already globally provides sharp object boundaries , but in order to reproduce them , both shape and ground plane loss terms were needed . So the model provides the right constraints in which all of those factors are considered . - `` How do you turn single-object 3D reconstruction models into priors , for scene-level inference ? '' is still a very open question , and more research is needed in this area . The fact that this methods requires such a prior could be a weakness to someone who prefers to see less assumptions made in favor of generalizability . But I believe objects have good enough scientific foundation to be beneficial in the long run . # # # Justification of rating Despite the weaknesses I listed , I feel that this paper is above threshold , albeit marginal . Other researchers can still learn from the design choices made even if it turns out that those constraints do n't work well in real scenes . I understand that this is a difficult task , and having a synthetic model as a reference point would ultimately help , assuming the code for reproducing the experiments will be fully released , to serve as a baseline .", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We thank you for your detailed feedback and helpful suggestions . We appreciate that you find our work to be an insightful baseline for the difficult task of multi-object 3D scene representation learning albeit its current limitation to synthetic data . In this response , we would like to answer your questions and address your concerns . - Synthetic Data Our synthetic scenes are composed of several simple and complex-shaped textured objects on a simple planar background . With this structured data we develop and demonstrate a basic novel learning architecture and point out the effectiveness of our design choices . The available ground truth information of our synthetic data allows us to perform an extensive evaluation in a defined setting which yields valuable insights . We expect significant advances in the upcoming years on the modeling of more realistic scenes by differentiable renderers . Our method tackles the orthogonal task of decomposing scenes into an object-wise 3D description in a self-supervised way . In this regard , our approach provides novel insights . We are optimistic that our work can provide a basis for object-wise representation learning of more complex and more realistic scenes using potential future advances in differentiable rendering . Regarding unlabeled in-the-wild images , we argue that the widely available RGB-D cameras could provide the necessary depth images for the training losses . The trained model could be used on RGB camera images since it does not require depth images at test time . Hence , the requirement of RGB-D data during training does not harm the motivation for our approach . - Object Count Experiment In the object count experiments , we set the number of object slots in the network according to the known number of objects in both the train and test data . As we use a shared encoder for all objects , we set the number of encoding rollouts to the current number of objects in the scene . While our network is able to hide remaining objects behind already reconstructed objects , it would not be able to reconstruct additional ones if we would not reset the number of encoding steps . We clarified this in the updated version . - Supervised Baseline We want to point out that using supervision in our approach is not straightforward due to the ambiguity of the objects ' order . To apply supervision e.g.for object poses , there would be two options : We would either need to tell the network which object to choose at the current step ( e.g.using object masks as additional input channel ) or we would need to match predicted and ground-truth objects . The first option would need additional information on the object id also during inference and thus neglects to learn to decompose a scene on its own . For the second option we evaluated using the distance between objects ' 3d positions for measuring the matching , however , this did not lead to stable training . - Additional Comments - We do include the background in our RGB evaluation since the reconstructed object might be rendered on a wrong position and thus occlude GT background area which should also be penalized . - The statement refers to the intersection loss L_int ( details in supplementary ) which we use for the following settings : a ) as extension to the training objective when training on tabletop scenes b ) for validation of manipulated scenes where we sample new object positions We clarified this sentence . - We updated Figure 2 in our main paper to make its structure more clear and easier to understand . - Table 2 : In our experiments , we find that it is depending on the object category whether the gap between seen and unseen objects would depend more on shape or on texture . Specifically , we considered the relative change in the RGB and depth losses which would indicate higher changes compared to GT in texture and shape , respectively . For cars , we observed a stronger relative worsening of the depth loss which indicates that the model prefers to focus on the new object 's texture . However , it is the other way round for the tabletop scenes . There are two possible explanations for this : One the one hand , higher variance in texture for tabletop objects makes it more difficult to replace new objects with similar known ones . On the other hand , the higher variance in shapes results in a lower relative increase of the depth loss for new shapes . We did not find such clear trends for the chair scenes . - Novel View Rendering We added qualitative results ( Figure 6 ) with renderings from novel views . While we want to highlight that our model was never trained for this task specifically , we get reasonable results . We will release our code , trained models , and datasets to foster reproducibility and future research ."}, {"review_id": "GwjkaD3g-V1-1", "review_text": "The authors proposed a method for 3D scene inference , which jointly does object instance detection , instance segmentation , object localization , and 3D shape and texture inference .

We want to address these points in the following : - Missing comparison to existing work , especially depth/ normal estimation methods : Our method does not only generate a depth-map based 3D reconstruction of a scene but also obtains an understanding of the scenes on object-level . This means , our model yields a disentangled representation for each object that can be used both to reason about them as well as to generate new scenes where individual objects were explicitly manipulated . This aspect of our work is motivated by potential future fields of application like robotics where dealing with objects is a crucial part of many tasks . From our perspective , a comparison to methods that focus only on a single part of the presented task would therefore ignore the additional value of our model and thus would yield only limited additional insights . We are happy for suggestions of particular meaningful baselines which we could try to compare with in the final version . - Design of method We have carefully designed our network architecture and training losses to tackle the task of self-supervised learning of multi-object 3D scene representation . Our main design choices are to use a pretrained 3D shape embedding and a differentiable renderer which encodes prior knowledge of object variation in a scene and how scene observations are generated from the latent representation . Differentiable rendering facilitates self-supervised training of the scene decomposition network . To the best of our knowledge , our approach is the first to tackle this challenging problem . Object bounding box detection pipelines such as Yolo or Faster R-CNN are typically trained supervised using ground-truth annotation of objects . Our encoder recursively detects and describes objects in the scene in terms of pose , shape and texture and is trained self-supervised . - Object relations are modeled in the following ways in our approach : 1 . The used ground loss L_gr motivates the network to place objects above the ground plane . For this it considers both their 3D position as well as their shape . As shown in the ablation study , this loss is important to learn a suitable scene representation . 2.In the tabletop scenes , we include relations between objects by an intersection loss ( see the supplementary material ) . Specifically , we penalize intersection between the objects ' 3D shapes . This is made possible by explicitly reasoning about the underlying 3D structure of the scene . 3.We can reason on object intersections when modifying object latents and generating new scenes , which we also used for the qualitative results shown for scene manipulation . - Evaluation on real data We provided qualitative results on real Clevr-like scenes in the supplementary material of the submitted version . In the updated version , we further included reconstructions of real scenes that consist of toy cars ( Figure 7 , main paper ) . For these experiments , we used the models trained and evaluated on synthetic data in the paper .
