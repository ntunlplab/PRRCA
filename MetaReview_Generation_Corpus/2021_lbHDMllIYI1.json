{"year": "2021", "forum": "lbHDMllIYI1", "title": "Sparse matrix products for neural network compression", "decision": "Reject", "meta_review": "The idea of using multiple sparse matrices seems to be new, but the novelty of the idea alone isn't enough to convince the AC and reviewers (indeed, the idea might not be new, but has never been discussed in literature because of the drawbacks we discuss here). As the authors and reviewers/AC seem to agree, the actual benefits of sparse matrix multiplies are hard to realize, especially on embedded devices, so the contributions at this point are mainly hypothetical and only about the new idea. Each reviewer brought up issues (even the most positive reviewer) and mostly the reviewers were not persuaded by the rebuttal. In short, there wasn't evidence that this new idea could really contribute to the state-of-the-art.  This is now a fairly crowded topic (e.g., all the  papers brought up by R3 in just that one class of methods), and new papers should beat state-of-the-art and/or introduce new theory -- an example would be a paper from last year's ICLR, https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJfwJ2A5KX , \"Data-Dependent Coresets for Compressing Neural Networks with Applications to Generalization Bounds\" (Baykal, Liebenwein, Gilitschenski, Feldman, Ru) which not only gives an efficient technique (not based on sparsity of weights) but also gives types of generalization guarantees.\n\nAs R1 said, the results are not state-of-the-art, and we have to believe the authors that \"an iterative-like extension of our method could reach even better results\". The rebuttal says that the paper's goal is to \"pioneer a new approach to neural network compression\". But if you can get better results with something better than Palm4MSA, then please do so, and demonstrate the evidence!  Right now, the paper assumes we could implement sparse multiplication efficiently on embedded devices, and assumes we could get better results: both these are quite hypothetical. The AC encourages a resubmission of this paper after these results have been addressed.", "reviews": [{"review_id": "lbHDMllIYI1-0", "review_text": "* * Summary * * : The paper proposes compressing the layers of the neural networks using a product of sparse matrices . This approach is in line with the initial methods on neural network compression : direct ( task-independent ) compression of weights , which is followed by NN task-dependent fine-tuning . In this case , the direct compression is obtained using the Palm4MSA method of Magoarou and Gribonval ( 2016 ) , and then models are fine-tuned in an end-to-end fashion using TensorFlow . * * Decision * * : Given the contributions of the paper and the lackluster experimental evaluation , I am recommending rejection . * * Detailed comments * * : The factorization as a product of sparse matrices is an interesting approach , and in its general form , such a scheme has not been studied in the context of neural network compression . However , the evaluation of the proposed approach is not convincing : - Effect of chaining sparse matrices for the actual inference is not discussed . As authors are well aware , the support of sparse matrix-vector products is limited in major frameworks and hardware . Therefore , chaining multiple sparse products might significantly delay the actual inference , even though it has fewer parameters and theoretically fewer FLOPs . - Comparison of different compression mechanism for neural networks is a very complex task : since most methods are applied per layer , the parameters of the compressions must be tuned per layer too : e.g. , ranks/sparsity of every layer can not have the same value , as some layers require more/fewer parameters . However , in the comparison , authors use uniform settings across layers for their method ( e.g. , M=4 cores ) and for other methods . The conclusions under such comparison strategy have a limited value : it says that chosen hyperparameters of compression A beats the chosen ( by hand ) hyperparameters of compression B in terms of final compression ratio/tradeoff etc . It leaves the possibility that by tuning parameters of B we might outperform A . To fully understand the usefulness of the compression scheme , we need to ask a different question : given the scheme A and B ( with the best selection of hyperparameters for both ) , compression using which scheme gives the smallest model for a given accuracy ? Or even better , which compression results in a better tradeoff when optimizing the shape/form of the schemes to suit the compression target ? - Related to the previous point , authors miss a large body of the methods that instead of expecting the weights to be in a certain form ( e.g. , sparse or low-rank ) , actually force the network to attain such form using penalties and constraints . For example , in terms of low-rank compression , here are some of the relevant works : 1 . Accelerating Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Classification and Detection ( IEEE TPAMI 2016 ) 2 . Coordinating Filters for Faster Deep Neural Networks ( ICCV 2017 ) 3 . Compression-Aware Training of Deep Networks ( NIPS2017 ) 4 . Constrained Optimization Based Low-rank Approximation of Deep Neural Networks ( ECCV 2018 ) 5 . Automated Multi-Stage Compression of Neural Networks ( ICCV Workshops 2019 ) 6 .

TRP : Trained Rank Pruning for Efficient Deep Neural Networks ( IJCAI 2020 ) There is an equally large body of literature on network sparsification . Please add the comparison to best-in-its-class results from the literature in order to fully evaluate the proposed scheme . * Minor concerns * : I strongly believe citing Li Deng for the MNIST dataset is inadequate .

We can \u2019 t deny that , in the current state of available hardware , an architecture with PSM layers could not compete with usual dense architectures , especially if run on modern GPU where most multiplications can be run simultaneously . However , we think that the accumulation of papers achieving interesting performances with sparsity based techniques can provide incentives to develop new hardware that would benefit from sparse multiplications . - In fact , concerning the Tucker decomposition , we use the VBMF strategy to discover the ideal rank for each layer ; concerning the iterative sparsity inducing technique , we use a global compression rate for the network but no particular constraint is set so that every layer should have the same compression rate : at each iteration a percentage of the global network weights are removed . The reviewer is correct concerning the other compression methods ( tensortrain and PSM ) and the general idea that it would be better to tune every compression strategy for every layer to achieve the best possible performance with a given compression rate .
