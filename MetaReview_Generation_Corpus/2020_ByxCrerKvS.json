Prior work has primarily focused on imputation methods, either end-to-end or otherwise. This paper approaches the problem as a set function mapping between the time-series tuples to the class label. The proposed method is uses a set encoding of a multi-modal time series input, followed by mode-specific encoding of the tuples which are then aggregated in multiple ways prior to classification. An attention mechanism is attached in order for the model to automatically weigh the relevance of tuples for the classification. The model is compared to imputation based baselines on clinical ICU time series classification tasks. The performance mostly appears comparable across baselines but the proposed method has much better run-times. The paper is for the most part well written, and related work well characterized. The formulation is interesting and clinically relevant as well so the choice of data-sets makes some sense. I have a few concerns about the architecture formulation and lack of clarification and intuition in what appears to be the main contribution of the paper (Sec 3.2 and 3.3) which I will detail below: a. In the evaluation, I really want to see a decoupling between the \"time encoding step\" and \"attention based aggregation\" on the performance to figure out to isolate different sources of performance improvements. That is can there be a SEFT without time encoding? If not, why not? I encourage more ablation like studies that look at different sources of performance gains and demonstrate them in experiments. b. The description of Sec 3.3. is really missing key motivation for the choices made around how the attention formulation is designed. For example why does the dot produce include the set elements? What if it doesn't? What is Q supposed to capture? c. Is a_{j,i} shared across instances? Then irrespective of the number of observations per instance, the $j^{th}$ tuple gets similar weights? If not appropriate indexing will help clarify this. d. It would be useful to provide how exactly a label is inferred for a *new* test instance. I have some minor additional feedback (just for presentation and motivation purposes): 1. Authors make a claim in the introduction which should likely be qualified with a citation - \"Furthermore, even though a decoupled imputation scheme followed by classification is generally more scalable, it may lose information that is relevant for prediction tasks\". How does decoupled imputation imply loss of relevant information? By losing information about which observations are missing and relying on that for prediction? Does this clinically make sense? Or even generally? 2. In Sec 3.3, you probably mean $W_i \\in R^{(im(f') + |s_j|) \\times d}$. That is parenthesis are missing? 3. What are the +- std errors indicating? Is it cross validation error on a held-out test set? 4. Initially $i$ is indexing samples and by equation (3), (4) $i$ indexes time(?) and in Sec 3.3 $i$ indexes observations? How are observations defined here? is it measurement of specific modality at a specific time instance? Can you clear this in the introduction itself? ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I have read the authors updated draft and response. The experiments section looks much better now. 1. The overall contribution has less clinical utility in my opinion as generally a patient likely deteriorates over time before an adverse outcome and therefore -- to give the model too much flexibility w.r.t. time ordering doesn't make quite as much sense. This is reflected in the fact that experimental results are not drastically better than other baselines. The authors might be able to show the utility of the method on other time series classification datasets where this is not a limitation of the data itself. However in those settings, it may be a bit hard to beat transformers. Do the authors have a sense of where the benefits of this method really are? 2. Mortality tasks are generally on the simpler side of clinical prediction problems as well. Nonetheless I think the contribution has some utility to the community. I do encourage the authors to try non--clinical datasets for a comparison 3. Please have a discussion that includes limitations and to discuss where the benefits of your methods really lie.

Inspired by the recent progress on differentiable set function learning, the paper proposes an approach called Set Functions for Time Series (SEFT), which views the time series as sets, and use a parametrized sum-decomposing function f as the model for representing the probabilities of different classes, with the sets as the inputs. The problem then reduces to learning the finite dimensional parametrization of the function f under a given loss, which is a differentiable optimization problem that can be learned via standard optimization methods. Together with a positional embedding of the timestamps and an attention-based aggregation, the paper reports improved performance of the proposed approach on a few healthcare time series with asynchronous and irregularly sampled data. In particular, the runtime is largely shortened, while the final accuracy remains competitive to other methods compared in the paper. The idea of SEFT is novel and the results are also showing its promise. In addition, the interpretability shown in section 4.3 is also attractive. However, there are several issues that limit the contribution and maturity of this paper. Firstly, the paper proposes to model time series as a set. But this loses the information of the order of the time series, which can be extremely important in those datasets with long history dependence. In such cases, I'm not convinced that the set modeling would work. The authors should double check the characteristics of the datasets that are used, and see if they lack long history dependence properties in intuition. If so, this should be mentioned clearly. The authors should also make a more fair comparison with other approaches (like those based on RNN) on datasets with strong history dependence, e.g., Memetracker datasets of web postings and limit-order books datasets. Otherwise, it would be not clear whether this set modeling is generally applicable for general time series data. Secondly, the authors missed a large amount of related literature for approaching asynchronous and irregularly sampled time series, namely (marked) point-process based approaches. See papers like [1, 2, 3], to name just a few. The authors should at least include some of the recent approaches in this direction for comparison before claiming the superiority of SEFT. Thirdly, there are a few parts that are not very clear. 1) The discussion about complexity (order m and m\\log m) at the bottom of page 1 is weird -- what does this complexity refer to? Does it include the learning of the unknown parameters in the models (like training of the neural networks in this paper)? 2) The loss function in formula (5) is not specified later in the paper (at least hard to find). 3) The Table 1 should be explained in much more details. In particular, why don't we include SEFT-ATTN for H-MNIST? The comment after * is also not clear to me -- is it relevant to why SEFT-ATTN is not included? And what are MICRO/MACRO/WEIGHTED AUC? And why are we using different sets of performance criteria for the first two and last two datasets? Finally, some minor comments: 1) On page 2, \"the following methods\" should be \"the above methods\"; 2) on page 3, the meaning of \"channels\" should be specified clearer; 3) on page 4, in formulae (3) and (4), should there be \\pi or 2\\pi in the formula?

The idea is certainly faster than the sequential algorithms such as RNNs and their extensions. However, as shown in the experiments, because it does not encode the \"sequential-ness prior\" to the model, it is less accurate. Compared to RNNs, the proposed model has better access to the entire length of sequences and does not suffer from the limited memory issues of RNNs and variants. The proposed idea in this paper can be considered a simplified version of the Transformers. Like transformers, the time and order are only provided to the model using the positional encoding and attention is central to aggregation over the sequence. Realizing the relationship with the Transformers not only decreases the novelty degree for this paper but also requires the authors to include the Transformers in the baselines. Finally, the results reported in the experiments are nice, especially for the baseline GRU-D!

Hence , in contrast to transformers , we do not include interactions between set elements during the computation of the embedding , as this strategy regularises the network . This is in line with the observation that for medical time series simple machine learning methods with summary statistics can already achieve very good performance ( see Harutyunyan et al . ( 2019 ) , for more details ) . Using an independent encoding of the individual set elements thus corresponds to computing multivariate data set specific summary statistics which optimize the classification performance . We completely agree that including transformers as an additional baseline makes a lot of sense ; we ran new experiments and updated the paper accordingly .

However, as shown in the experiments, because it does not encode the \"sequential-ness prior\" to the model, it is less accurate. Compared to RNNs, the proposed model has better access to the entire length of sequences and does not suffer from the limited memory issues of RNNs and variants. The proposed idea in this paper can be considered a simplified version of the Transformers. Like transformers, the time and order are only provided to the model using the positional encoding and attention is central to aggregation over the sequence. Realizing the relationship with the Transformers not only decreases the novelty degree for this paper but also requires the authors to include the Transformers in the baselines. Finally, the results reported in the experiments are nice, especially for the baseline GRU-D! However, the MIMIC-III Mortality benchmark has a lot more than 21,000 stays to the best of my recollection. Can you please elaborate on how the number of data points has decreased?", "rating": "3: Weak Reject", "reply_text": "> Sequentialness prior Our approach is exhibiting competitive performance with respect to standard measures . To better showcase this , we added a visualisation ( Figures A.1 and A.2 in the appendix ) depicting the trade-offs in performance and runtime . > The proposed idea in this paper can be considered a simplified version of the Transformers architecture [ ... ] Interestingly , in the initial phases of the project we found that the naive application of transformer architectures leads to low generalization performance and overfitting , despite the use of regularisation . We found that the independent encoding of individual observations * improves * the generalization performance . Hence , in contrast to transformers , we do not include interactions between set elements during the computation of the embedding , as this strategy regularises the network . This is in line with the observation that for medical time series simple machine learning methods with summary statistics can already achieve very good performance ( see Harutyunyan et al . ( 2019 ) , for more details ) . Using an independent encoding of the individual set elements thus corresponds to computing multivariate data set specific summary statistics which optimize the classification performance . We completely agree that including transformers as an additional baseline makes a lot of sense ; we ran new experiments and updated the paper accordingly . In general , we observe that the performance of the transformer architecture exhibits competitive runtimes , but non-competitive classification performance . It was thus necessary to change parts of the results and discussion section to maintain a consistent story of the paper . > However , the MIMIC-III Mortality benchmark [ ... ] In order to stay comparable with other research in the field , we decided to use the same dataset as Harutyunyan et al . ( 2019 ) and only remove the imputation and resampling steps to obtain a more raw , irregularly sampled version of the dataset . The original publication by Harutyunyan et al . ( 2019 ) consists of 21,139 patients ( in their paper , see Page 10 , Fig.7 ) .We discard 32 of these patients as they showed a drastically higher sampling rate , which lead to memory issues in the baselines .
