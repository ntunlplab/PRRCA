For the sake , the paper combines Gumbel-Softmax based GAN , relativistic discrimination function with the matching of mean representations of true and generated samples in a latent feature space . This feature statistics alignment allows to leak information from the discriminator to the generator as the used features are extracted from the discriminator network . Experimental evaluations on synthetic and real datasets show the improvement achieved by the proposed method over existing sequence generation networks . Reasons for score : The paper straightforwardly combines existing procedures ( relativistic discriminator , Gumbel-Softmax approximation for categorical distribution , features matching ) to improved upon vanilla sequence generation networks and somehow lacks novelty . Although the ablation study is interesting and shows the improvement brought by each module , examples of lengthy generated sequences illustrate that the sentences produced by the GAN are not semantically meaningful . Pros : - Overall , the paper is well written . In particular , the rationale behind the proposed method is justified . Empirical evaluations support these intuitions and show how they contribute to the observed quality of the generated sequences . - The paper aims at addressing a major issue in training GAN for sequence generation : how to strengthen the learning of the generator compared to the discrimination network which is easier to train ? The approach promoted in the paper consists to align the mean statistics of true sequences and fake ones . Specifically , the statistics are computed over features extracted from discrimination network . The objective function of the generator is therefore composed of the usual GAN loss term and the distance between those mean representations . As such , this idea of guiding the generation network with information from the discriminator is interesting and plays a key role in the performances improvement . - In the same vein , the use of Gumbel-Softmax distribution ( instead of the discrete distribution ) and of the relativistic discrimination function ( instead of the classical classification function ) helps to learn a better generation model . However these ideas are not novel and were investigated separately in previous research works . - Experimental evaluations , including both qualitative analysis and quantitative results , are provided in the paper and in the supplementary to show the effectiveness of the proposed framework . The newly proposed GAN achieve superior performances . The comprehensive ablation study is interesting and helps to understand how each module ( feature alignment , Gumbel-Softmax , batch size ) contributes to the enhanced performances . Cons : - Although the proposed method , according to the empirical results , show improved performances , it lacks novelty as features matching , relativistic discrimination or Gumbel-Softmax are not new ideas . The main contribution resides in the better quantitative results compared to existing sequence generation networks . However when one examines the generated sentences , it appears that they lack semantic meaningfulness especially for long sentences ( see for instance Table 8 ) . This shows that the proposed GAN ( as well as the competitors ) is not effective yet . - Features distribution alignment is an interesting way to measure how close are the marginal distributions of the real and fake sequences . The paper considers the Mean Distance Alignment ( MDA ) and the Mean Square alignment ( MSA ) which are respectively the distance and the squared distance between the mean latent representations of the real and generated sequences . Several comments can be made as hereafter . * MSA and MDA encode the same matching up to a power 2 . It \u2019 s unclear why they lead to different empirical results . * Instead of matching only the mean statistics , the overall distributions of the latent representations can be aligned by considering metrics such as MMD or Wasserstein distance . How would the results look like in that setting ? * It should be clarified earlier in the paper that the used features are extracted from the discrimination network ( as the weights between the discriminator and feature extractor are shared ) . Also the paper should make explicit from which layer of the discrimination network the features are extracted . - The findings of human evaluation ( see Table 5 ) are not unequivocal . MSA and MDA achieve higher scores than the real sentences . The best model , the one with MSA , is not preferred because of a lack of diversity and quality . This raises the question of how reliable is the human evaluation score . Other comments : - Page 3 , definition of MSA : in the sentence \u201c mean squared difference between the centroids ... \u201d , the term mean is over-used as Eq . ( 2 ) or ( 3 ) represents only the squared distance between centroids . - Page 4 : in \u201c The FSA term on the RHS can also be regarded as a dynamic regularizer for the sequence generator \u201d the notion of dynamic regularizer is unclear . In which sense FSA induces a dynamic regularization ? - In Equation ( 10 ) the function \u201c one_hot \u201d should be defined . Also in ( 10 ) , I think $ y_i $ should read the $ |V| $ -dimensional vector $ y $ . - Equation ( 11 ) is to be checked carefully as the parameter $ \\tau $ simplifies in numerator and denominator . - Algorithm 1 : the update of the generator $ G_\\theta $ requires a minibatch from real dataset in order to minimize $ L_ { RG } $ + $ L_ { FSA } $ as $ L_ { FSA } $ relies on the mean of real data latent representation . After rebuttal - I read the response of the authors . The spotted typos are fixed in the revision . Some questions/concerns have been tentatively . However the novelty in the paper is still not blatant or how the use of distance such as MMD or Wasserstein to match the features is under-explored . Hence I intend to keep my rating .", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "8 . `` MSA and MDA achieve higher scores than real sentences . '' This is because MSA and MDA tend to generate longer grammatically correct sentences , whereas the MSA tends to fall into limited patterns ( but still with good quality ) . The quality of reference captions in MS COCO Image Caption datasets is various , in which some sentences would be single phrases . It makes sense to get a higher score if the model tends to generate sentences with a longer length and better grammaticality . 9 . `` The term mean is over-used '' Thank you for pointing out this detail ! We rewrote the description before Eq . ( 2 ) for clarity . 10 . `` In which sense FSA induces a dynamic regularization ? '' From the initial idea of our paper , the FSA serves to provide fine-grained learning signals during the training process , besides the original GAN 's signal . From the perspective of loss terms , the FSA could be regarded as a constraint that dynamically modulates the feature alignments between real and generated feature representations .

Our paper aims to mitigate the difficulty of the generator training by providing * * additional signals * * from the discriminator , whereas conventional feature matching serves as the training objective for both the generator and discriminator in language GANs . The FSA technique empirically achieves superior performance on Gumbel-Softmax GANs without introducing extra training parameters . * * Detailed answer * * : The paper proposed an FSA mechanism to improve the Gumbel-Softmax-based GAN 's training , and achieves the superior performance compared with previous works . It is indeed that the FSA is a form of feature matching . However , previous language GANs using feature matching directly optimize the feature matching metrics , such as TextGANs , FM-GANs , etc . Instead of directly optimizing the feature matching loss for both the generator and discriminator , we use FSA to align the feature distribution and assist the training of only the generator . Besides , the proposed FSA is used to provide fine-grained learning signals for the generator besides the original ( coarse ) learning signals of language GANs . The idea of FSA could also be regarded as a resemblance to feature leakage in LeakGAN ( Guo et.al.2018 ) , which leaks the features from the discriminator to the generator . 2.Thank you for pointing out the mistake , it should be `` the lower \u03c4 could discourage exploration and tend to * * exploit * * during training '' . 3.Due to the page limit , we do not include the comparison between generated samples and the proposed method .

Indeed , the Texygen benchmark ( Zhu et al. , 2018 ) we followed used Self-Bleu to measure the diversity of generated real sentences . However , it is not feasible to use it as the evaluation metric . * * A short answer * * : There is a problem when using the official implementation of Self-Bleu , which has been pointed out in previous work ( Nie et.al.2019 ; Zhou et . al.2020 ) . * * Detailed answer * * : Previous work did not use it since there is an issue in the official implementation ( https : //github.com/geek-ai/Texygen/blob/master/utils/metrics/SelfBleu.py ) : the generated sentences changed but the reference remained the same during the evaluation process . It is discussed in the appendix of SAL ( Zhou et.al.2020 ) and the openreivew of RelGAN paper ( Nie et.al.2019 ) .As reported in SAL and RelGAN , our self-BLEU ( 2-5 ) scores are also always 1 . Thus we do not use the Self-BLEU metric . For reference , we copy it here : `` 'Note that many previous works use self-BLEU Zhu et al . ( 2018 ) as a diversity metric . However , we find that there exists a problem in the official implementation of the self-BLEU metric : Only in the first time of evaluation that the reference and hypothesis come from the same \u201c test data \u201d ( i.e.the set of generated sentences ) . After that , the hypothesis keeps updated but the reference remains unchanged ( due to \u201c is-first=False \u201d ) , which means hypothesis and reference are not from the same \u201c test data \u201d anymore , and thus the scores obtained under this implementation are not self-BLEU scores . To this end , we modified the implementation to make sure that the hypothesis and reference are always from the same \u201c test data \u201d ( by simply removing the variables `` self.reference '' and `` self.is-first '' ) and found that the self-BLEU ( 2-5 ) scores are always 1 when evaluating all the models .

For the sake , the paper combines Gumbel-Softmax based GAN , relativistic discrimination function with the matching of mean representations of true and generated samples in a latent feature space . This feature statistics alignment allows to leak information from the discriminator to the generator as the used features are extracted from the discriminator network . Experimental evaluations on synthetic and real datasets show the improvement achieved by the proposed method over existing sequence generation networks . Reasons for score : The paper straightforwardly combines existing procedures ( relativistic discriminator , Gumbel-Softmax approximation for categorical distribution , features matching ) to improved upon vanilla sequence generation networks and somehow lacks novelty . Although the ablation study is interesting and shows the improvement brought by each module , examples of lengthy generated sequences illustrate that the sentences produced by the GAN are not semantically meaningful . Pros : - Overall , the paper is well written . In particular , the rationale behind the proposed method is justified . Empirical evaluations support these intuitions and show how they contribute to the observed quality of the generated sequences . - The paper aims at addressing a major issue in training GAN for sequence generation : how to strengthen the learning of the generator compared to the discrimination network which is easier to train ? The approach promoted in the paper consists to align the mean statistics of true sequences and fake ones . Specifically , the statistics are computed over features extracted from discrimination network . The objective function of the generator is therefore composed of the usual GAN loss term and the distance between those mean representations . As such , this idea of guiding the generation network with information from the discriminator is interesting and plays a key role in the performances improvement . - In the same vein , the use of Gumbel-Softmax distribution ( instead of the discrete distribution ) and of the relativistic discrimination function ( instead of the classical classification function ) helps to learn a better generation model . However these ideas are not novel and were investigated separately in previous research works . - Experimental evaluations , including both qualitative analysis and quantitative results , are provided in the paper and in the supplementary to show the effectiveness of the proposed framework . The newly proposed GAN achieve superior performances . The comprehensive ablation study is interesting and helps to understand how each module ( feature alignment , Gumbel-Softmax , batch size ) contributes to the enhanced performances . Cons : - Although the proposed method , according to the empirical results , show improved performances , it lacks novelty as features matching , relativistic discrimination or Gumbel-Softmax are not new ideas . The main contribution resides in the better quantitative results compared to existing sequence generation networks . However when one examines the generated sentences , it appears that they lack semantic meaningfulness especially for long sentences ( see for instance Table 8 ) . This shows that the proposed GAN ( as well as the competitors ) is not effective yet . - Features distribution alignment is an interesting way to measure how close are the marginal distributions of the real and fake sequences . The paper considers the Mean Distance Alignment ( MDA ) and the Mean Square alignment ( MSA ) which are respectively the distance and the squared distance between the mean latent representations of the real and generated sequences . Several comments can be made as hereafter . * MSA and MDA encode the same matching up to a power 2 . It \u2019 s unclear why they lead to different empirical results . * Instead of matching only the mean statistics , the overall distributions of the latent representations can be aligned by considering metrics such as MMD or Wasserstein distance . How would the results look like in that setting ? * It should be clarified earlier in the paper that the used features are extracted from the discrimination network ( as the weights between the discriminator and feature extractor are shared ) . Also the paper should make explicit from which layer of the discrimination network the features are extracted . - The findings of human evaluation ( see Table 5 ) are not unequivocal . MSA and MDA achieve higher scores than the real sentences . The best model , the one with MSA , is not preferred because of a lack of diversity and quality . This raises the question of how reliable is the human evaluation score . Other comments : - Page 3 , definition of MSA : in the sentence \u201c mean squared difference between the centroids ... \u201d , the term mean is over-used as Eq . ( 2 ) or ( 3 ) represents only the squared distance between centroids . - Page 4 : in \u201c The FSA term on the RHS can also be regarded as a dynamic regularizer for the sequence generator \u201d the notion of dynamic regularizer is unclear . In which sense FSA induces a dynamic regularization ? - In Equation ( 10 ) the function \u201c one_hot \u201d should be defined . Also in ( 10 ) , I think $ y_i $ should read the $ |V| $ -dimensional vector $ y $ . - Equation ( 11 ) is to be checked carefully as the parameter $ \\tau $ simplifies in numerator and denominator . - Algorithm 1 : the update of the generator $ G_\\theta $ requires a minibatch from real dataset in order to minimize $ L_ { RG } $ + $ L_ { FSA } $ as $ L_ { FSA } $ relies on the mean of real data latent representation . After rebuttal - I read the response of the authors . The spotted typos are fixed in the revision . Some questions/concerns have been tentatively . However the novelty in the paper is still not blatant or how the use of distance such as MMD or Wasserstein to match the features is under-explored . Hence I intend to keep my rating .", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "8 . `` MSA and MDA achieve higher scores than real sentences . '' This is because MSA and MDA tend to generate longer grammatically correct sentences , whereas the MSA tends to fall into limited patterns ( but still with good quality ) . The quality of reference captions in MS COCO Image Caption datasets is various , in which some sentences would be single phrases . It makes sense to get a higher score if the model tends to generate sentences with a longer length and better grammaticality . 9 . `` The term mean is over-used '' Thank you for pointing out this detail ! We rewrote the description before Eq . ( 2 ) for clarity . 10 . `` In which sense FSA induces a dynamic regularization ? '' From the initial idea of our paper , the FSA serves to provide fine-grained learning signals during the training process , besides the original GAN 's signal . From the perspective of loss terms , the FSA could be regarded as a constraint that dynamically modulates the feature alignments between real and generated feature representations .

We address your specific questions and comments below : Questions : 1.About novelty : * * A short answer * * : Different motivation and usage . Our paper aims to mitigate the difficulty of the generator training by providing * * additional signals * * from the discriminator , whereas conventional feature matching serves as the training objective for both the generator and discriminator in language GANs . The FSA technique empirically achieves superior performance on Gumbel-Softmax GANs without introducing extra training parameters . * * Detailed answer * * : The paper proposed an FSA mechanism to improve the Gumbel-Softmax-based GAN 's training , and achieves the superior performance compared with previous works . It is indeed that the FSA is a form of feature matching . However , previous language GANs using feature matching directly optimize the feature matching metrics , such as TextGANs , FM-GANs , etc . Instead of directly optimizing the feature matching loss for both the generator and discriminator , we use FSA to align the feature distribution and assist the training of only the generator . Besides , the proposed FSA is used to provide fine-grained learning signals for the generator besides the original ( coarse ) learning signals of language GANs . The idea of FSA could also be regarded as a resemblance to feature leakage in LeakGAN ( Guo et.al.2018 ) , which leaks the features from the discriminator to the generator . 2.Thank you for pointing out the mistake , it should be `` the lower \u03c4 could discourage exploration and tend to * * exploit * * during training '' . 3.Due to the page limit , we do not include the comparison between generated samples and the proposed method .

There are more method using Gumbel-softmax [ Gu et al.2019 ] and a similar softmax with temperature annealing . It is not clear for the authors to explicitly discriminate using Gumbel-softmax and other smoothed softmax methods . - Some related work were missed such as DialogWAE [ Gu et al.2019 ] and ARAML [ Ke et al.2019 ] .In particular , DialogWAE uses GAN and Gumbel-softmax for text generation even if it focuses on dialog generation . - For verifying mode collapse issues , how about using Self-BLUE in addition to BLUE scores as a metric to evaluate the diversity ? - Novelty might be incremental .

We address your specific questions and comments below : # # Question # 1 We agree that there are several works in language GANs that employ the temperature annealing in the generator . However , there are only few works , such as RelGAN ( Nie et.al.2019 ) , that leverage Gumbel-Softmax tricks in language GANs on real datasets . By saying `` it is under-explored '' , we mean that there remains an open problem on its improvement . Thank you for pointing out this , we have clarified it in the revised paper . # # Question # 2 Thank you for giving the related work of language GANs on dialogue generation . We have added these works on the paper . # # Question # 3 Good question ! Indeed , the Texygen benchmark ( Zhu et al. , 2018 ) we followed used Self-Bleu to measure the diversity of generated real sentences . However , it is not feasible to use it as the evaluation metric . * * A short answer * * : There is a problem when using the official implementation of Self-Bleu , which has been pointed out in previous work ( Nie et.al.2019 ; Zhou et . al.2020 ) . * * Detailed answer * * : Previous work did not use it since there is an issue in the official implementation ( https : //github.com/geek-ai/Texygen/blob/master/utils/metrics/SelfBleu.py ) : the generated sentences changed but the reference remained the same during the evaluation process . It is discussed in the appendix of SAL ( Zhou et.al.2020 ) and the openreivew of RelGAN paper ( Nie et.al.2019 ) .As reported in SAL and RelGAN , our self-BLEU ( 2-5 ) scores are also always 1 . Thus we do not use the Self-BLEU metric . For reference , we copy it here : `` 'Note that many previous works use self-BLEU Zhu et al . ( 2018 ) as a diversity metric . However , we find that there exists a problem in the official implementation of the self-BLEU metric : Only in the first time of evaluation that the reference and hypothesis come from the same \u201c test data \u201d ( i.e.the set of generated sentences ) . After that , the hypothesis keeps updated but the reference remains unchanged ( due to \u201c is-first=False \u201d ) , which means hypothesis and reference are not from the same \u201c test data \u201d anymore , and thus the scores obtained under this implementation are not self-BLEU scores . To this end , we modified the implementation to make sure that the hypothesis and reference are always from the same \u201c test data \u201d ( by simply removing the variables `` self.reference '' and `` self.is-first '' ) and found that the self-BLEU ( 2-5 ) scores are always 1 when evaluating all the models . This problem is also discussed in the openreview of the RelGAN paper . ' '' ( Zhou et.al.2020 ) # # Question # 4 Good point !
