Given an input signal of one source ( e.g. , vocal or bass ) , the system is trained to generate one or more accompanying signals ( drums , full arrangement ) . The authors propose a CycleGAN model to learn transformations between source and accompaniment domains . The model is trained on a combination of a large collection of automatically separate signals ( FMA ) and a small collection of isolated stem recordings ( musdb ) . The models for two tasks ( bass- > drum and vocal- > full ) were evaluated by a combination of human listener testing and automatic offline scoring , to somewhat mixed results . Overall , I found this paper interesting and generally well-written . The combination of subjective and offline evaluation was nice to see , and given the inherent difficulty of the problem , I do n't consider the mixed results to be a total negative here . That said , I do think there are areas in which this paper could be significantly improved , both in terms of experimental design and exposition . The experiments presented here make use of both pre-separated stems ( MusDB ) and automatically separated signals produced by DEMUCS on the FMA dataset . Given the size of available stem datasets , I understand the motivation for going this route . However , I think there needs to be some quantitative evaluation of the impact of each part here , for several reasons : 1 . DEMUCS is by no means perfect , and we should expect some bleed-through of the target signal ( eg drums ) into the separated signal ( eg bass ) . If this happens , the task becomes significantly easier than if the system was presented with clean stems . 2.We ca n't rely on previously reported BSS-EVAL metrics to give a sense of DEMUCS ' performance on FMA for generating the training data . The FMA dataset is quite different from MusDB in terms of production quality and instrumentation , and given the small size of MusDB , the reported metrics are almost certainly an over-estimate of quality we should expect on FMA . 3.It is not demonstrated that including the FMA data is necessary or beneficial for this task ( though it 's not unreasonable to expect that this is indeed true ) . An experiment showing how the system performs if only trained end-to-end on musdb would make the existing results easier to interpret and place in context . In terms of exposition , as stated above , I find the paper mostly clear and easy to follow . However , many technical details are omitted that make it both impossible to reproduce and difficult to interpret . The biggest omission here is the specific method for recovering the waveform from the generated Mel spectrograms .

In listening to the included examples , it 's pretty clear that there 's a great deal of phase distortion in the results of both tasks .

Minor comments : - The authors claim that the source separation model ( DEMUCS ) is time-equivariant ( section 3.1 ) , but I do n't see how this is justified . DEMUCS uses a U-net architecture with a bidirectional LSTM middle layer , which is not generally time-equivariant . - Why are the spectrograms quantized to 256 values ? I agree that this probably does n't introduce much distortion , but it seems unnecessary . Point of clarification : are these spectrograms using linear magnitude or logarithmic ( decibel ) magnitude ?

Also , the authors propose a novel evaluation metric , which learns how to rate generated audio from the ratings of ( some ) music experts . The authors make use of two large-scale datasets to train and evaluate the model on two scenarios , namely 1 ) generating drum accompaniment a given bass line , 2 ) generating arrangement given a voice line . They report promising results on the first task ; however , the model is not as successful on the second ( more challenging ) task . The problem is challenging , and meaningful solutions may bring innovative and creative solutions to music production . The literature is well-covered , with a few missing citations ( see below ) . The approach is built upon existing work , and the experiments are conducted on two relevant , public datasets . On the other hand , the experimental code is not shared , and the dataset section lacks a few details to reproduce the findings easily . Below are the shortcomings of the paper : 1 . While adapting past music generation work for arrangement generation is not trivial , the authors could have still used variants of CycleGAN and other unpaired image-to-image translation models for comparison . 2.The sources are primarily limited to bass , drums , and vocals . I do not think the narrow scope is an issue on a paper focusing on an unexplored subject . On the contrary , the experiments could have more variety , e.g.drums2bass , bass & vocals2drums , and other combinations , so that we could examine which settings bring interesting and/or challenging outcomes in arrangement generation . 4.The evaluation and discussion could have more depth , e.g.inter-annotator agreement , the effect of source separation in the generated audio ( separation errors , audible artifacts , ... ) The paper is novel in its application and brings promising results . However , the authors should extend the experiments , compare relevant models against each other , and discuss the results more in detail . Therefore , I would strongly encourage the authors to build upon their existing work and re-submit the revised paper to ICLR or another conference such as ISMIR . Specific comments == - As mentioned above , the authors should have added more `` experimental settings . '' At least they should have included `` generation of a bass line given the drums '' ( reverse of bass2drums ) because 1 ) it would have allowed the readers to contrast the performance with bass2drums , 2 ) the task would be closer to the real-world use case ( drums are typically the first to be recorded in a session followed by bass ) . - The method works on music strictly with drums , bass and vocals , which is not mentioned until Section 3.4 . This limitation/condition should be specified clearly and earlier in the Introduction and/or in Section 3.1 . - `` Nevertheless , only raw audio representation can produce , at least in the long run , appealing results in view of music production for artistic and commercial purpose . '' Even if we restrict ourselves to popular music , this argument is too ambitious if not misleading . Many artists ( performers , composers , conductors , etc . ) are not only well fledged but - by profession - required to appreciate music by reading sheet music . Countless programmable interfaces and software , which make use of symbolic/hybrid music representations but do not generate raw audio directly , have been used extensively as part of music performances and production in a both artistic and commercial setting . While audio - without any doubt - is the essence of music , we can never disregard other representations . - Citing the two papers below could improve the literature review : > Hawthorne , Stasyuk , Roberts , Simon , Huang , Dieleman , Elsen , Engel and Eck , `` Enabling Factorized Piano Music Modeling and Generation with the MAESTRO Dataset '' , International Conference on Learning Representations , 2019 . = > similar to the authors ' design decision , this paper uses a cheaper intermediate representation ( music scores ) for efficiency > Donahue et al.LakhNES : Improving multi-instrumental music generation with cross-domain pre-training = > the paper involves mapping ( `` arranging '' ) the instrumentation in MIDI files to NES sound channels . - Please cite ` FMA ` and ` MusDB18 ` datasets following the instructions in the respective online sources . - Section 3.1 . `` While showing nice properties , '' The authors only mention that Demucs solve audio source separation ( for the data the authors use ) and the algorithm is time equivariant . However , the text reads like the authors would like to state other properties as well . If there are others , they should be stated explicitly . - Section 3.2 . The authors should mention and cite the library they have used to extract MFCCs . - Section 4.1 `` we chose to select only pop music and its sub-genres for a total of approximately 10,000 songs '' It would be beneficial to share IDs of the songs in the subset for reproducibility purposes . Also , the authors do not state whether they use the untrimmed or trimmed versions of the tracks in the FMA dataset , which is a crucial detail for model training as well as experimental reproducibility . - The authors should state : 1. number of songs used from the MusDB18 dataset ( i.e.have they used both the train and test splits ? ) 2.Total duration and number of samples in training , test and fine-tuning - In the test set , instead , we chose only a few samples for each song due to the relative uniformity of its content : in other word , we expect our model to perform in similar ways on different parts of the same song . I find this assumption a bit unrealistic . In what sense , is the content uniform across the song ? Is it uniformity in mixing , structure , arrangement , melody , tempo , or rhythm ? Even if the authors use trimmed audio excerpts for training/testing , these characteristics can vary substantially within seconds ( even if they use trimmed tracks ) . The authors should clearly state how they define content uniformity , provide a more informed argument around this assumption and experimentally show that the assumption holds for the test set . - Section 4.2 : `` the result is somehow subjective thus different people may end up giving different or biased ratings based on their personal taste '' The authors portrait subjectivity as unfavourable . However , - as a human construct - there are no objective , universal criteria for appreciating music . Likewise , the evaluation metric , which the authors are proposing , is based on the subjective responses from music experts . I think the justification needs rephrasing . - Section 4.3 : In the paper , the authors do not state the cultural background or the genre ( s ) of the focus of the music experts . The inter-agreement between the experts are not presented either . Due to lack of information and the small number of subjects , it is difficult to assess whether the ( trained ) evaluation metric has positive/negative/desired biases based on the experience , knowledge , personal taste etc . of the experts . Therefore , the claim about the proposed `` metric correlating with human judgment '' is a bit weak . - What is the distribution of scores for bass and voice ? - How much do the artifacts ( due to imperfections in source separation ) affect the judgements ?

'' The phrasing somewhat disregards the music studios . - Page 2 , top row : `` given a musical sample encoded in a two-dimensional time-frequency representation ( known as Mel-spectrogram ) '' It reads like all two-dimensional time-frequency representations are called `` Mel-spectrogram '' s , instead of the authors using Mel-spectrograms , which is one type of two-dimensional time-frequency representations . - The text should explain the relevance of the selected experimental settings to the music production : e.g.drums and bass are usually the first `` sessions '' to be recorded ; a demo typically consists of the melodic prototype/idea with minimal accompaniment , which is later arranged by many collaborators ... - `` Figure 1 shows a Mel-spectrogram example , a visual representation of a spectrum , where the x axis represents time , the y axis represents the Mel bins of frequencies and the third gray tone axis represents the intensity of the sound measured in decibel ( Briot et al. , 2020 ) . '' I do not understand what the authors mean by `` third gray tone axis . '' Is it because the MFCCs are treated as a single channel image , hence `` gray '' ? If yes , it is better to state that the `` MFCCs are treated as a single channel image '' without resorting to image processing jargon . - `` Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients are the dominant features used in speech recognition , as well as in some music modeling tasks ( Logan & Robinson , 2001 ) '' It may be better to introduce this sentence earlier in the paragraph . - Section 3.4 : `` On the one hand , ...

Overall I think the paper requires significant revision and additional work before it can be accepted as a conference publication . Title : -The title is misleading . The title claims that the proposed model is for `` Automatic Music Production '' . However the actual task considered is more restrictive . The authors propose a model for automatic accompaniment . Music Production involves many other tasks like mixing , mastering and so on , none of which are a part of this study . The title should therefore be updated to be more specific .

If not , the authors should present some justification for the demand for this technology from artists and producers . - '' Automatic music arrangement from raw audio in the frequency domain '' : why not simply say automatic music arrangement/accompaniment in the Mel-frequency domain ? I find the raw audio part of the description unnecessary and confusing . -The authors claim that the they are the first to treat music audio as images and then apply techniques from computer vision .

There are hundreds of other publications that are similar to this approach . Introduction : -The authors claim that automatic accompaniment in the waveform/frequency domain has many advantages . However they fail to motivate the short-comings of this approach . Namely the lack of source separated training data and the extreme difficulty in source separation for music recordings . It would also be useful to cite a review paper or some of the many publications on automatic accompaniment generation in the symbolic domain so that the reader can find references to this problem which has an extensive literature already . -The authors mention that they use the Demucs algorithm for source separation . However they do not provide any details whatsoever about this approach , especially the downsides . A quick scan of the paper reveals that the algorithm introduces severe artefacts under various conditions . -The authors mention the low-computational cost of their proposed method , however they do not satisfactorily quantify this claim . Firstly , is computational cost an issue ? Does this algorithm have to run on a mobile device ? Will it be run in a streaming setting ? These questions are not answered in the paper . Related Works : -The authors cite many papers on music generation in the waveform domain however they do not cite any of the extensive literature on music generation in the symbolic domain . This literature is extremely relevant to the work presented in this paper . - '' Nevertheless , only raw audio representation can produce , at least in the long run , appealing results in view of music production for artistic and commercial purposes . '' Why is this the case ? Why is generating music in the symbolic domain and then using state-of-the-art synthesisers not an appealing direction ? This point is n't made clear in the paper . Method : -There are no details provided about the Demucs algorithm used to separate the source training data into various channels like vocal , bass , drums etc . How big was the model ? Did the authors train the model themselves ? Did they use a pre-trained model ? Were there any artefacts present in the source separated tracks ? Are there any downsides to this algorithm ? Are there any alternatives to this algorithm ? Do the artefacts not interfere with the downstream task ? -A reference/citation about the Mel scale would be useful . -There are no details about the CycleGAN used in the paper . How big is the model ? What is the architecture ? How was it trained ? What flavour of gradient descent was used for training ? What are the hyper-parameters ? Was the model trained on a single GPU ? Experiments : -How was the subset of pop music selected ? How was the metadata filtered to obtain the 10000 tracks used for training ? If the filtering algorithm can not be outlined , then it would be useful to provide a list of the 10000 tracks used for training , for the purpose of reproducibility . -How did the authors arrive on the 4 attributes quality , euphony , coherence and intelligibility ? Is there some theory that suggests that these 4 attributes would be useful in determining whether the accompaniment is somehow good ? These attributes have been presented without justifications and citations . -The features ( STOI , FID ) used to compare the automatically generated accompaniment have also been presented without much justification .

Moreover , many musicians and artists can not real music and would be more comfortable to work in a less formalized setting . Finally , state-of-the-art synthesizers , although increasingly indistinguishable from live recordings , can not yet reproduce the infinite nuances of real voices and instruments .

However , I think there needs to be some quantitative evaluation of the impact of each part here , for several reasons : 1 . DEMUCS is by no means perfect , and we should expect some bleed-through of the target signal ( eg drums ) into the separated signal ( eg bass ) . If this happens , the task becomes significantly easier than if the system was presented with clean stems . 2.We ca n't rely on previously reported BSS-EVAL metrics to give a sense of DEMUCS ' performance on FMA for generating the training data . The FMA dataset is quite different from MusDB in terms of production quality and instrumentation , and given the small size of MusDB , the reported metrics are almost certainly an over-estimate of quality we should expect on FMA . 3.It is not demonstrated that including the FMA data is necessary or beneficial for this task ( though it 's not unreasonable to expect that this is indeed true ) . An experiment showing how the system performs if only trained end-to-end on musdb would make the existing results easier to interpret and place in context . In terms of exposition , as stated above , I find the paper mostly clear and easy to follow . However , many technical details are omitted that make it both impossible to reproduce and difficult to interpret . The biggest omission here is the specific method for recovering the waveform from the generated Mel spectrograms . Phase information is discarded early on in the process , but is critical to the perceptual quality of generated audio . In listening to the included examples , it 's pretty clear that there 's a great deal of phase distortion in the results of both tasks . ( It 's less perceptible in the drum synthesis task because the target signal does not generally consist of sustained tones , but it 's still audible . ) This left me wondering how exactly the phase retrieval is done , and to a lesser extent , how the Mel spectrogram inversion is done . Minor comments : - The authors claim that the source separation model ( DEMUCS ) is time-equivariant ( section 3.1 ) , but I do n't see how this is justified . DEMUCS uses a U-net architecture with a bidirectional LSTM middle layer , which is not generally time-equivariant . - Why are the spectrograms quantized to 256 values ? I agree that this probably does n't introduce much distortion , but it seems unnecessary . Point of clarification : are these spectrograms using linear magnitude or logarithmic ( decibel ) magnitude ? This decision would have a significant effect on how quantization is performed , but it 's not clearly articulated in the paper . Figure 1 suggests a log scaling , but does not provide details . An equation would go a long way here . - Is there any windowing applied in the short-time Fourier transform ( eg Hann or Hamming ) ? I would expect so based on the lack of transient artifacts in Figure 1 , but it 's not explicitly stated . I ask because having listened to the provided examples , it sounds like there could be some modulation artifacts in the reconstruction that could be traced to the choice of window function . Aside : if you 're using an existing software package to implement your Mel spectrogram , it should be cited . - I like the approach of mapping automatic scores to human judgments , but I 'm confused as to why the targets were binarized .

Also , the authors propose a novel evaluation metric , which learns how to rate generated audio from the ratings of ( some ) music experts . The authors make use of two large-scale datasets to train and evaluate the model on two scenarios , namely 1 ) generating drum accompaniment a given bass line , 2 ) generating arrangement given a voice line . They report promising results on the first task ; however , the model is not as successful on the second ( more challenging ) task . The problem is challenging , and meaningful solutions may bring innovative and creative solutions to music production . The literature is well-covered , with a few missing citations ( see below ) . The approach is built upon existing work , and the experiments are conducted on two relevant , public datasets . On the other hand , the experimental code is not shared , and the dataset section lacks a few details to reproduce the findings easily . Below are the shortcomings of the paper : 1 . While adapting past music generation work for arrangement generation is not trivial , the authors could have still used variants of CycleGAN and other unpaired image-to-image translation models for comparison . 2.The sources are primarily limited to bass , drums , and vocals . I do not think the narrow scope is an issue on a paper focusing on an unexplored subject . On the contrary , the experiments could have more variety , e.g.drums2bass , bass & vocals2drums , and other combinations , so that we could examine which settings bring interesting and/or challenging outcomes in arrangement generation . 4.The evaluation and discussion could have more depth , e.g.inter-annotator agreement , the effect of source separation in the generated audio ( separation errors , audible artifacts , ... ) The paper is novel in its application and brings promising results . However , the authors should extend the experiments , compare relevant models against each other , and discuss the results more in detail . Therefore , I would strongly encourage the authors to build upon their existing work and re-submit the revised paper to ICLR or another conference such as ISMIR . Specific comments == - As mentioned above , the authors should have added more `` experimental settings . '' At least they should have included `` generation of a bass line given the drums '' ( reverse of bass2drums ) because 1 ) it would have allowed the readers to contrast the performance with bass2drums , 2 ) the task would be closer to the real-world use case ( drums are typically the first to be recorded in a session followed by bass ) . - The method works on music strictly with drums , bass and vocals , which is not mentioned until Section 3.4 . This limitation/condition should be specified clearly and earlier in the Introduction and/or in Section 3.1 . - `` Nevertheless , only raw audio representation can produce , at least in the long run , appealing results in view of music production for artistic and commercial purpose . '' Even if we restrict ourselves to popular music , this argument is too ambitious if not misleading . Many artists ( performers , composers , conductors , etc . ) are not only well fledged but - by profession - required to appreciate music by reading sheet music . Countless programmable interfaces and software , which make use of symbolic/hybrid music representations but do not generate raw audio directly , have been used extensively as part of music performances and production in a both artistic and commercial setting . While audio - without any doubt - is the essence of music , we can never disregard other representations . - Citing the two papers below could improve the literature review : > Hawthorne , Stasyuk , Roberts , Simon , Huang , Dieleman , Elsen , Engel and Eck , `` Enabling Factorized Piano Music Modeling and Generation with the MAESTRO Dataset '' , International Conference on Learning Representations , 2019 . = > similar to the authors ' design decision , this paper uses a cheaper intermediate representation ( music scores ) for efficiency > Donahue et al.LakhNES : Improving multi-instrumental music generation with cross-domain pre-training = > the paper involves mapping ( `` arranging '' ) the instrumentation in MIDI files to NES sound channels . - Please cite ` FMA ` and ` MusDB18 ` datasets following the instructions in the respective online sources . - Section 3.1 . `` While showing nice properties , '' The authors only mention that Demucs solve audio source separation ( for the data the authors use ) and the algorithm is time equivariant . However , the text reads like the authors would like to state other properties as well . If there are others , they should be stated explicitly . - Section 3.2 . The authors should mention and cite the library they have used to extract MFCCs . - Section 4.1 `` we chose to select only pop music and its sub-genres for a total of approximately 10,000 songs '' It would be beneficial to share IDs of the songs in the subset for reproducibility purposes . Also , the authors do not state whether they use the untrimmed or trimmed versions of the tracks in the FMA dataset , which is a crucial detail for model training as well as experimental reproducibility . - The authors should state : 1. number of songs used from the MusDB18 dataset ( i.e.have they used both the train and test splits ? ) 2.Total duration and number of samples in training , test and fine-tuning - In the test set , instead , we chose only a few samples for each song due to the relative uniformity of its content : in other word , we expect our model to perform in similar ways on different parts of the same song . I find this assumption a bit unrealistic . In what sense , is the content uniform across the song ? Is it uniformity in mixing , structure , arrangement , melody , tempo , or rhythm ? Even if the authors use trimmed audio excerpts for training/testing , these characteristics can vary substantially within seconds ( even if they use trimmed tracks ) . The authors should clearly state how they define content uniformity , provide a more informed argument around this assumption and experimentally show that the assumption holds for the test set . - Section 4.2 : `` the result is somehow subjective thus different people may end up giving different or biased ratings based on their personal taste '' The authors portrait subjectivity as unfavourable . However , - as a human construct - there are no objective , universal criteria for appreciating music . Likewise , the evaluation metric , which the authors are proposing , is based on the subjective responses from music experts . I think the justification needs rephrasing . - Section 4.3 : In the paper , the authors do not state the cultural background or the genre ( s ) of the focus of the music experts . The inter-agreement between the experts are not presented either . Due to lack of information and the small number of subjects , it is difficult to assess whether the ( trained ) evaluation metric has positive/negative/desired biases based on the experience , knowledge , personal taste etc . of the experts . Therefore , the claim about the proposed `` metric correlating with human judgment '' is a bit weak . - What is the distribution of scores for bass and voice ? - How much do the artifacts ( due to imperfections in source separation ) affect the judgements ?

'' I do not understand what the authors mean by `` third gray tone axis . '' Is it because the MFCCs are treated as a single channel image , hence `` gray '' ? If yes , it is better to state that the `` MFCCs are treated as a single channel image '' without resorting to image processing jargon . - `` Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients are the dominant features used in speech recognition , as well as in some music modeling tasks ( Logan & Robinson , 2001 ) '' It may be better to introduce this sentence earlier in the paragraph . - Section 3.4 : `` On the one hand , ...

The title claims that the proposed model is for `` Automatic Music Production '' . However the actual task considered is more restrictive . The authors propose a model for automatic accompaniment . Music Production involves many other tasks like mixing , mastering and so on , none of which are a part of this study . The title should therefore be updated to be more specific .

I find the raw audio part of the description unnecessary and confusing . -The authors claim that the they are the first to treat music audio as images and then apply techniques from computer vision .

There are hundreds of other publications that are similar to this approach . Introduction : -The authors claim that automatic accompaniment in the waveform/frequency domain has many advantages . However they fail to motivate the short-comings of this approach . Namely the lack of source separated training data and the extreme difficulty in source separation for music recordings . It would also be useful to cite a review paper or some of the many publications on automatic accompaniment generation in the symbolic domain so that the reader can find references to this problem which has an extensive literature already . -The authors mention that they use the Demucs algorithm for source separation . However they do not provide any details whatsoever about this approach , especially the downsides . A quick scan of the paper reveals that the algorithm introduces severe artefacts under various conditions . -The authors mention the low-computational cost of their proposed method , however they do not satisfactorily quantify this claim . Firstly , is computational cost an issue ? Does this algorithm have to run on a mobile device ? Will it be run in a streaming setting ? These questions are not answered in the paper .

Method : -There are no details provided about the Demucs algorithm used to separate the source training data into various channels like vocal , bass , drums etc . How big was the model ? Did the authors train the model themselves ? Did they use a pre-trained model ? Were there any artefacts present in the source separated tracks ? Are there any downsides to this algorithm ? Are there any alternatives to this algorithm ? Do the artefacts not interfere with the downstream task ? -A reference/citation about the Mel scale would be useful . -There are no details about the CycleGAN used in the paper . How big is the model ? What is the architecture ? How was it trained ? What flavour of gradient descent was used for training ? What are the hyper-parameters ? Was the model trained on a single GPU ?

If the filtering algorithm can not be outlined , then it would be useful to provide a list of the 10000 tracks used for training , for the purpose of reproducibility . -How did the authors arrive on the 4 attributes quality , euphony , coherence and intelligibility ? Is there some theory that suggests that these 4 attributes would be useful in determining whether the accompaniment is somehow good ?

Moreover , many musicians and artists can not real music and would be more comfortable to work in a less formalized setting .
