The malware classifier is mostly composed of an RNN acting on featurized API calls (events). The presentation could be improved. The results are encouraging, but the experiments lack solid baselines, comparisons, and grounding of the task usefulness, as this is not done on an established benchmark.", "reviews": [{"review_id": "SJg6nj09F7-0", "review_text": "This paper attempts to train a predictor of whether software is malware. Previous studies have emulated potential malware for a fixed number of executed instructions, which risks both false negatives (haven\u2019t yet reached the dangerous payload) and false positives (malware signal may be lost amidst too many other operations). This paper proposes using deep reinforcement learning over a limited action space: continue executing a program or halt, combined with an \u201cevent classifier\u201d which predicts whether individual parts of the program consist of malware. The inputs at each time step are one of 114 high level \u201cevents\u201d which correspond to related API invocations (e.g. multiple functions for creating a file). One limitation seems to be that their dataset is limited only to events considered by a \"production malware engine\", so their evaluation is limited only to the benefit of early stopping (rather than continuing longer than the baseline malware engine). They evaluate a variety of recurrent neural networks for classifying malware and show that all significantly underperform the \u201cproduction antimalware engine\u201d. Integrating the event classifier within an adaptive execution control, trained by DQN, improves significantly over the RNN methods. It might be my lack of familiarity with the domain but I found this paper very confusing. The labeling procedure (the \"production malware engine\u201d) was left entirely unspecified, making it hard to understand whether it\u2019s an appropriate ground-truth and also whether the DRL model\u2019s performance is usable for real-world malware detection. Also, the baseline models used an already fairly complicated architecture (Figure 3) and it would have been useful to see the performance of simple heuristics and simpler models.

For example , in solving a maze problem using RL , the action space only includes \u201c left \u201d , \u201c right \u201d , \u201c up \u201d and \u201c down \u201d four actions . In learning to play blackjack game using reinforcement learning ( Sutton & Barto ( 1998 ) ) , the action space only includes \u201c fold \u201d and \u201c hit \u201d two actions . Second , as given by the state definition in the paper , a previous action will affect the current state . For instance , if a \u201c Halt \u201d action is chosen at the last state , the current state will be the same as the last state ( i.e.loop back to the last state ) . Comparatively , if a \u201c continue \u201d action is selected at the previous state , the current state will contain a new event ; at the same time , the previous events \u2019 information is stored in the histogram . A very important reason why we choose to use DRL instead of standard deep learning or other supervised learning models for this problem is because there is no ground truth for the stop/continue decisions for an anti-malware engine . The engine can only learn \u201c when to stop \u201d based on the reward/penalty between its interaction with the input file . The engine will stop if it is confident enough to decide : a . The file is a malware or b . The file is benign , and the engine can stop wasting computational resources . This conclusion is gradually learned through the interaction between the engine and the input file by accumulating the confidence rewards ( either positive or negative ) . The procedure is most suitable to be modeled by reinforcement learning , which can learn the action using accumulated information without a concrete ground truth . 2.We were not clear in the earlier draft , but we have compared the proposed system to many different baselines . We have made the point clearer in the text . As shown in Figure 6 and 7 , we have compared our model \u2019 s result with 5 baselines using the recently proposed state-of-the-art models for malware classification . In the revised draft , we added another experiment using the convolutional neural network ( CNN ) based classifier introduced in Kolosnjaji et al ( 2016 ) for malware classification task and another one for a single hidden layer neural network . It is shown that our DRL-based model outperforms all 7 baselines in terms of the true positive rate at the same false positive rate . Considering the uniqueness of this type of malware detection task , there is no public dataset available . Also due to the sensitivity of the malware information , companies do not share these datasets in order to prevent attackers from using the datasets to generate adversarial attacks in the wild .

To the best of our knowledge , it is also the first study in security field to detect the malware using a DRL-based system . The originality of this paper is from a novel neural malware control model which learns the best time to halt the execution of an unknown file based on deep reinforcement learning . Also , our model contains several inter-connected submodules , and the DRL model is one of the important modules in the system .

Using DRL offers significant improvement ( improves the true positive rate by 61.5 % , at a false positive rate of 1 % ) compared to the best previously proposed solution . Another contribution of this paper is the unique reward design for this specific problem , the choice of rewards is not arbitrary but follows the two rules as described in paper : a ) the DRL network can learn to halt emulation as quickly as possible . b ) The closer an event prediction is to the true label of the file , the larger the reward should be given at that state . Only because the reward is designed following these two rules , better results for malware detection are obtained . It is also the use of deep reinforcement learning that gives us the flexibility to design the rewards satisfying our requirements . 2.As suggested by the reviewer , we added one more experiment using a CNN-based classifier in Figure 6 . Also , in ( Athiwaratkun & Stokes ( 2017 ) ) , it was shown that the model with an attention layer performs worse than our baseline model with an LSTM and a max pooling layer on this malware classification task . For this reason , we did not compare the models with the one with an attention layer in our experiments . The max pooling layer seems to work much better due to sporadic nature of the malicious activity in malware .
