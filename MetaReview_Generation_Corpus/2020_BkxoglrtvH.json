The paper received three reviews, all of which recommended Weak Reject. The reviewers generally felt the topic of the paper was very interesting, but overall felt that the insights that the paper revealed were relatively modest, and had concerns about the connections between DNN and human learning (e.g., the extent to which DNNs are biologically plausible -- including back propagation, batch normalization, random initialization, etc. -- and whether this matters for the conclusions of the present study). In response to comments, the authors undertook a significant revision to try to address these points of confusion. However, the reviewers were still skeptical and chose to keep their Weak Reject scores.\n\nThe AC agrees with reviewers that investigations of the similarity -- or not! -- between infant and deep neural networks is extremely interesting and, as the authors acknowledge, is a high risk but potentially very high reward research direction. However, in light of the reviews with unanimous Weak Reject decisions, the AC is not able to recommend acceptance at this time. I strongly encourage authors to continue this work and submit to another venue; this would seem to be a perfect match for CogSci conference, for example.

In particular, it chooses two deep nets, CORnet and DeepCluster to measure learning. CORnet is supervised and is designed to mimic the architecture and representational geometry of the visual system. It tries to quantify the development of explicit object representations at each level of this network through training by freezing the convolutional layers and training an additional linear decoding layer. The paper evaluates the decoding accuracy on the whole ImageNet validation set for individual visual classes. DeepCluster differ in both supervision and in the convolutional networks. To isolate the effect of supervision, it ran a control experiment in which the convolutional network from DeepCluster (an AlexNet variant) is trained in a supervised manner. The paper tries to draw conclusions on how learning should develop across brain regions in infants. In all the networks, it also tested for a relationship in the order in which infants and machines acquire visual classes, and found only evidence for a counter-intuitive relationship. Limitations The topic is extremely interesting and worth intense study. However, the approach is not convincing. CORnet may have some relevances. It is not clear how well it models the representational geometry of the visual system. It is even less clear whether DeepCluster is relevant. Why would it be related to infant learning?

The paper measures the amount of class information in each layer over the progress of training. I agree that deep networks could serve as good models for various parts of the brain, including the visual system especially given that convolutional networks have been inspired from studies of the visual system. However, the paper doesn't seem to provide any evidence for how the training process used for deep neural networks should correspond to the development of the visual system in infants. In particular, backpropagation is considered biologically implausible [1], whereas backpropagation serves as the main method for learning in the neural networks. Furthermore, neural networks have randomly initialized parameters, whereas it seems unlikely that human infants' brains would lack existing organization to such a drastic extent. In order for the results in this paper to hold greater weight, I would expect to see more evidence about how the neural network training process (also including aspects such as batch normalization, and the self-supervised clustering method in DeepCluster) are expected to correlate with learning in human brains.
