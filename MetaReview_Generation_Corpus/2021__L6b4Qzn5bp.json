Experiments were conducted on CT images from three groups : Covid-19 group , common pneumonia group , and heathy group with about 900 samples in each group . The proposed model achieved 94.7 % accuracy . Pros : The manuscript proposes a distance aware pooling method which , with the help of features generated through inception v3 , could achieve an error rate of a little bit over 5 % Cons : In terms of the potential impact of the work , my concerns are as follows : 1 . Although the model trained on the dataset achieved a relatively low error rate ( ~ 5.3 % ) , there is no evidence that this error rate is low enough for the model developed to be really useful , e , g . could actions taken based on a diagnosis method of this level of error rate potentially create a local epidemic ? 2.The model is not tested on an independent dataset that consists of other type of lung diseases other than common pneumonia . Is it possible that the model could actually categorize CT from a patient with another type of lung disease as Covid-19 ? Thus , this 94.7 % accuracy probably needs to be taken with a grain of salt when the model is to be used to test patients clinically . In terms of the technical soundness of the work and writing of the manuscript , my concerns are as follows . 1.Although the manuscript claims the distance aware pooling method as its main contribution , the description of the method is no more than one figure . It is unclear how this pooling function is computed exactly . Nor is it clearly stated how does it fit in overall model of the graph convolutional neural network as well . Even in the figure , some of the terms is used without giving clear definition ( e.g.adjacency matrix centered at a specific node ) . Further , There is no discussion of strengths and limitations of the proposed pooling method and the method it is trying to compare against ASAP , specifically in the context of CT imagining . 2.Almost the same can be said about the section of \u201c improved receptive field \u201d . What is the motivation of improving receptive field ? Why is it relevant in the case of graph formed of CT imaging . ( incidentally , it seems that how authors do not mention in the manuscript how the edges are added to the graph , but I might have missed this ) . The impact of the radius \u201c h_d \u201d on the model performance is not discussed , either . 3.How many time have the authors randomly split training and testing set ? the variance from different runs are not reported . It is a standard practice to report both the mean of the performance from different runs as well as the variance . 4.Since the problem that the manuscript is trying to solve is a graph classification and main contribution of the manuscript is a pooling method , the authors should consider comparing their pooling methods with different pooling methods and using different graph classification methods as baseline as well . See Zhang et al Hierarchical Graph Pooling with Structure Learning https : //arxiv.org/abs/1911.05954 Li et al Graph Matching Networks for Learning the Similarity of Graph Structured Objects ICML 2019 Overall , the manuscript could be improving by stating more clearly the motivation of their pooling method in the context of CT imaging , giving a more complete and rigorous definition of the pooling function , comparing their method against different pooling methods using different classification methods , and having a more detailed discussion on the strengths and limitations of different pooling methods .", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "We appreciate your kind and insightful comments .

We have given our responses as the follows : 1 . * Whether the model was over-fitted is not clear * Following your advice , we further provide the training curve in Figure 4 . Figure 4 represents the training curves of the GCN diagnosis model using DAP versus ASAP over 20 runs with varied random seeds and different train-validation-test split . The solid lines represent the mean training loss and validation accuracy , and the shade visualizes the interval of one standard deviation . It shows that DAP consistently outperforms ASAP across almost all runs , and converges much faster . 2 . * Prognosis information is an added claim , though the automation part is not integrated . * The prognosis is also an end-to-end model . The initialization of the prognosis model is based on the model trained for diagnosis . 3 . * It will be better if approach is compared with another concurrent work - `` Covid-19 Classification by FGCNet with Deep Feature Fusion from Graph Convolutional Network and Convolutional Neural Network '' - * [ https : //www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1566253520303705 * ] ( https : //www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1566253520303705 ) * . * We note that this paper is published on October 9th , which is later than the deadline for ICLR . We will compare the above methods with our model . However , this may be finished in the discussion period . We will finish it as soon as possible and add it to the experiment section before publication . 4 . * too many repeating verbatim and technical descriptions - most can be delegated to references / citations or section numbers . * Thank you for your insightful advice .

The pooling ratio does not significantly influence graph classification and localization if ratio k is larger than 50 % . 10 . * As a general comment , too many to point individually - break the sentences around mathematical terminology into parts and also check the flow of grammar . * Thanks for your advice . We have polished our writing . 11 . * '' Haar wavelet function with resolution 3 '' - more details on this . * Haar wavelet is a sequence of rescaled functions , which can be used in image compression . Resolution 3 means that the image decomposition processes are performed three times . After 3 decomposition processes , the approximation coefficients , which contain most information of the image , are used for downstream calculations ."}, "2": {"review_id": "_L6b4Qzn5bp-2", "review_text": "Summary The manuscript proposes a distance aware pooling method to use in graph convolutional neural for predicting whether a subject is infected with Covid-19 ( diagnosis ) and progression of the disease ( prognosis ) . Experiments were conducted on CT images from three groups : Covid-19 group , common pneumonia group , and heathy group with about 900 samples in each group . The proposed model achieved 94.7 % accuracy . Pros : The manuscript proposes a distance aware pooling method which , with the help of features generated through inception v3 , could achieve an error rate of a little bit over 5 % Cons : In terms of the potential impact of the work , my concerns are as follows : 1 . Although the model trained on the dataset achieved a relatively low error rate ( ~ 5.3 % ) , there is no evidence that this error rate is low enough for the model developed to be really useful , e , g . could actions taken based on a diagnosis method of this level of error rate potentially create a local epidemic ? 2.The model is not tested on an independent dataset that consists of other type of lung diseases other than common pneumonia . Is it possible that the model could actually categorize CT from a patient with another type of lung disease as Covid-19 ? Thus , this 94.7 % accuracy probably needs to be taken with a grain of salt when the model is to be used to test patients clinically . In terms of the technical soundness of the work and writing of the manuscript , my concerns are as follows . 1.Although the manuscript claims the distance aware pooling method as its main contribution , the description of the method is no more than one figure . It is unclear how this pooling function is computed exactly . Nor is it clearly stated how does it fit in overall model of the graph convolutional neural network as well . Even in the figure , some of the terms is used without giving clear definition ( e.g.adjacency matrix centered at a specific node ) . Further , There is no discussion of strengths and limitations of the proposed pooling method and the method it is trying to compare against ASAP , specifically in the context of CT imagining . 2.Almost the same can be said about the section of \u201c improved receptive field \u201d . What is the motivation of improving receptive field ? Why is it relevant in the case of graph formed of CT imaging . ( incidentally , it seems that how authors do not mention in the manuscript how the edges are added to the graph , but I might have missed this ) . The impact of the radius \u201c h_d \u201d on the model performance is not discussed , either . 3.How many time have the authors randomly split training and testing set ? the variance from different runs are not reported . It is a standard practice to report both the mean of the performance from different runs as well as the variance . 4.Since the problem that the manuscript is trying to solve is a graph classification and main contribution of the manuscript is a pooling method , the authors should consider comparing their pooling methods with different pooling methods and using different graph classification methods as baseline as well . See Zhang et al Hierarchical Graph Pooling with Structure Learning https : //arxiv.org/abs/1911.05954 Li et al Graph Matching Networks for Learning the Similarity of Graph Structured Objects ICML 2019 Overall , the manuscript could be improving by stating more clearly the motivation of their pooling method in the context of CT imaging , giving a more complete and rigorous definition of the pooling function , comparing their method against different pooling methods using different classification methods , and having a more detailed discussion on the strengths and limitations of different pooling methods .", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "We appreciate your kind and insightful comments . The following are responses to detailed comments . 1 . * Although the model trained on the dataset achieved a relatively low error rate ( ~ 5.3 % ) , there is no evidence that this error rate is low enough for the model developed to be really useful , e , g . could actions taken based on a diagnosis method of this level of error rate potentially create a local epidemic ? * Although RC-PCR is the standard diagnostic method , it has several limitations , especially its low sensitivity . According to Fang et al. , 2020 , the sensitivity of chest CT is much greater than that of RT-PCR ( 98 % vs 71 % , respectively ; P > 001 ) . Our model \u2019 s sensitivity of COVID-19 diagnosis is 93.8 % , which shows that our work is a great alternative to RT-PCR and can be clinically useful .

Our method outperforms the recent counterpart consistently and significantly . Our method achieves 94 % average test accuracy with only 0.41 % standard deviation , while the average accuracy of baseline GCN-ASAP is 75 % with a 19 % standard deviation . We further provided the maximum , average , standard standard deviation of test accuracies over 20 runs , with various random seeds and different train-validation-test splits . The training curve using DAP versus ASAP over 20 runs are presented in Figure 4 in our paper . The figure shows that our model improves the training convergence . It shows that DAP consistently outperforms ASAP across almost all runs .

Currently , we focus on the classification of healthy , common pneumonia , and Covid-19 . The common pneumonia group consist of viral pneumonia , bacterial pneumonia , and mycoplasma pneumonia , all of which are the most common causes of pneumonia in China . We also agree that further collaborations for collecting more data of lung diseases other than pneumonia will further improve our result .
