Comments from other reviewers and revisions have deliberately not been taken into account. After publishing this review, this reviewer will participate in the forum discussion and help the authors improve the paper. ## Overall The article proposes a method of modifying image-generating networks to also produce depth maps in an unsupervised way by enforcing rotational consistency. I enjoyed reading this work and I'm recommending it to be accepted. However, first there are some (in my opinion straight-forward) changes that need to be made to this work before I can recommend its publication: - The common \"Related Works\" section is missing and some of the literature is taking place in the introduction. I find this unorganized and I'd recommend keeping the intro shorter and just moving the literature either behind the intro or to the end of the paper. - Most figures and especially your headline figure (1) suffer from not having the depth normalized and not having a scale to it. The fix for this is simple and two-fold: for each depth image, subtract the minimum value and divide by the range (to normalize it and increase contrast), then write in the caption or as a legend that white is closer to the camera and black is further back. - 3D vs. 2.5D - If the common geometric definition of \"3D\" was applied here, the article's title was correct. However, in computer vision and especially 3D vision, the term is commonly used to refer only to models that include full scene geometry, including the occluded backs of objects and the term 2.5D is used to describe assigning depth values to pixels in an RGB image (and therefore only covering the view-dependent front of the object), which I think is the case here. However, this is not a hill that I'll die on so if you insist on that terminology, I won't block acceptance. - When you first discuss HoloGAN, you mention one of its main downsides being scalability and then proceed to not only explain that but also use a HoloGAN-like architecture in one of your experiments. I'd either remove the scalability argument or justify not just that but also how that's not relevant to your experiments. - The following phrase occurs multiple times throughout: \"camera parameter conditional image generation\". I _think_ you're missing a dash between \"parameter\" and \"conditional\". ## Specific comments and questions ### Abstract All good. ### Intro - Fig.1 normalize image - The literature section in intro mentions \"For all methods, 3D annotations must be used...\" - that's not true. See [Rezende, 2016][1] and [Rajeswar, 2018][2] - I understand how some literature is required to position your method, but I think it's better to not have the entire literature section in the center of the introduction [1]: https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00662 [2]: https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJeem3C9F7 ### Method - 2.1 clear + nicely written - Figure 2 good, caption a bit too short - figure+caption should be able to stand on their own - Illustration of Figure 3 nice, except for unclear DeepVoxel part: what's the wavy orange flag stand for? ### Experiments - You mention K is fixed, but where does the initial K come from? I assume it's just neglected (since it's not important for StyleGAN/PGGAN), but then this needs to be mentioned in the methods sections closer to the formulas dealing with K. - Figure 4 - the depth maps need to be normalized. All we see here is a grey mush, even worse in Fig. 7 - For ShapeNet cars, the model seems to suffer from not having a reference for the top and bottom of the image - have you tried adding floor/sky? - Figure 6, the tire marker is a good idea but image still unclear - I recommend slightly less rotation or an intermediate step between generated image and e.g. front view - For quantitative results/FID: try using Hausdorff or Chamfer distance on the rendered scenes' pixels. We don't care about the goodness of the RGB generation but the depth. ### Conclusion All good, albeit a bit short. ### Appendix I don't think I saw any references to the appendix in the main paper.", "rating": "6: Weak Accept", "reply_text": "We would like to thank the reviewer for valuable comments . Related works - We will separate the related work section from the introduction section . Depth visualization - We will normalize the depth maps and visualize it in colormap ( as reviewer2 says ) for better visualization . 3D vs. 2.5D - Our model can not only generate RGBD images , which is commonly considered 2.5D , but also explicitly control camera poses while preserving the image content . Therefore , it can be regarded that the model can learn full 3D geometry implicitly , though the output is not fully 3D . This is the intuition to use the word `` 3D '' . Scalability of HoloGAN - We agree that the badness of the scalability of HoloGAN is not supported by our experimental results . Therefore , we will delete the scalability part from the introduction .

DeepVoxels are implicit representations , and we can not visualize what is acquired . We agree that the figure is ambiguous , we will replace the figure . About K - Because learning K from single images is difficult , we initialize K with [ [ 2s , 0 , s/2 ] , [ 0 , 2s , s/2 ] , [ 0 , 0 , 1 ] ] ( numpy-style order ) , where $ s $ is image size . We will add the explanation in the paper . floor/sky - We did not try adding floor or sky to render the ShapeNet car dataset . We think adding simple sky or floor will help learning depth information to some extent , but it is difficult to learn consistent depth . This is because foreground regions have common salient concepts across views ( eg.tire , headlight , window , ... ) but the background does not . This is also problematic when we train the model on a car image dataset , which has floor and sky , as shown in Figure 7 . Evaluation for depth - Evaluating the generated depth is difficult because we can not obtain ground truth depth for the generated images . A possible approach to evaluate depth images without ground truth images is calculating the inception score ( IS ) [ 5 ] or FID on the generated depth images , but we do not think it is appropriate . This is because IS and FID are estimated in the feature space of a pre-trained CNN , and they can not consider the geometry in the 3D world . Therefore it is almost impossible to evaluate how the generated depth is plausible in 3D space . Instead , we will evaluate the depth consistency across views to quantitatively compare the generated depth among different methods . When we plot point clouds generated from the same $ z $ but different $ c $ , all points should be on a single surface . Therefore , by calculating the variation of the generated depth , we can quantitatively evaluate the 3D consistency across views . It is expected that 3D-latent-feature-based models have better performance than other models . We will add the results in the paper .

I understand that \"warp\" is the combined Rt matrix that is estimated using the two views and Equation 3, assuming that the \"d\"s are correct.

It uses a simple idea, and performs sufficient number of experiments to explore the idea. It is not very novel, but the paper shows its applicability with multiple architectures as a bonus. The figures showed results almost only from their method. It would be great to pick one generator architecture, and elucidate more on the differences between not using their 3D loss and using it. Good attempt though.

We will add more explanation in the paper . - Since the depth values in warp ( G_ { D } ( z , c_2 ) , c_ { 1- > 2 } ) are sampled from the depth values viewed from c_2 , to compare G_ { D } ( z , c_1 ) with warp ( G_ { D } ( z , c_2 ) , c_ { 1- > 2 } ) , we need to project the depth values of each pixel in G_ { D } ( z , c_1 ) to the viewpoint c_2 .
