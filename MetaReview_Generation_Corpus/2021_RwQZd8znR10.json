The approach is based on learning an exploration policy to quickly discriminate the task at hand , so that to leverage a task-specific policy for exploitation . To do so , it employs an intrinsic reward proportional to the information gain ( or prediction error ) over both the transition and reward models . Finally , the algorithm is evaluated over a set of continuous control domains with sparse rewards . * EVALUATION * The idea of focusing the exploration on identifying the current task , instead of collecting good samples for policy improvements , is quite interesting , albeit not completely novel . Unfortunately , the lacking presentation does not help assessing the real quality of the contributions and the robustness of the experimental analysis , and it make me leaning towards a negative evaluation . However , I believe that a partial overhaul of the paper structure , along with a sharper experimental analysis , would make for a nice contribution to the meta RL community . * DETAILED COMMENTS * C1 ) As noted by the authors , the idea of maximizing information gain over the transition model in a single-environment setting has been presented in VIME ( Houthooft et al.2016 ) , while Zhou et al . ( 2018 ) employs information gain to fast identification of the transition model in multi-environment setting . Thus , the main contribution of this work seems to account also for the reward model in the information gain computation . However , it is not clear to me how this can lead to a significant improvement , especially in sparse-reward settings , where rewards are zero almost everywhere . C2 ) An information theoretic approach to leverage the reward structure in a multi-goal scenario has been previously proposed in ( Goyal et al.InfoBot : Transfer and exploration via the information bottleneck . ICLR 2019 ) . Though the setting is not equivalent , I am wondering how their concept of * decision state * relates to the idea of fast identification of the reward model . C3 ) The paper propose two alternatives reward function , one that essentially normalizes the prediction error with the predictability of the transition ( IG ) , and the other that solely consider the prediction error ( PE ) . While the experimental analysis shows a slight edge for the latter , I would say that this might be negligible with respect to the ability of the former to deal with noisy environments ( as explained in Section 4.4 ) . * QUESTIONS * - Could the authors address the comments above in their response ? - The last line of Section 3 says that the proposed intrinsic reward does not vanish over time : Can the authors explain why ? - The experimental setup describes a very short adaptation phase ( hundreds of samples ) but the subsequent plots are functions of millions of samples . Could the authors clarify the experimental setup , especially the number of samples employed in the meta-training and meta-testing phases ? * ADDITIONAL FEEDBACK * - I would suggest to revise the structure of the paper by focusing on the core ideas first , and to the implementation details later . - I did not find the notation crystal clear , especially regarding the role of the context c , and the indiscriminate use of the words trajectory , episode , experience . To me it would be better to refer as sample every ( s , a , r , s ) tuple and trajectory every sequence of samples from the initial state to the end of an episode . - In my opinion the experimental section could be sharper . I would suggest to focus on a smaller set of domains ( such as one with changing dynamics , one with changing rewards and one with both for the Mujoco set , in addition to the two Meta-World ) and a smaller set of comparisons , and to seek for a clearer illustrations of the benefits of MetaCURE with respect to other methods . - I believe the ablation study to be central in the evaluation of MetaCURE . Especially , I would have preferred to see a convincing assessment of the benefit of computing the information gain over both the reward and transition models , with respect to accounting just for the former or the latter . - I would not claim the performance of Meta-World Push ( Table 1 ) to be significantly higher than PEARL , since the confidence intervals are overlapping . Averaging over more trials might help . - I think the main text relies too much on the Appendix : It is fine to have proofs and derivations out of the paper , but I would not directly comment in the experimental section figures that only appear in the Appendix . # # # # # # # # # # # # # AFTER RESPONSE I would like to thank the authors for the detailed response . I encourage them to keep working on MetaCURE : With some improvements I believe it will provide a valuable contribution to the meta-RL field .", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "Thank you for your comments . A new version of MetaCURE will be proposed soon to improve novelty as well as performance . Q1 : The main contribution of this work seems to account also for the reward model in the information gain computation . However , it is not clear to me how this can lead to a significant improvement , especially in sparse-reward settings , where rewards are zero almost everywhere . A1 : By considering information gain in reward model , MetaCURE encourages exploration on regions that potentially obtain non-zero rewards , which can be much larger than rewarding regions in a single task . As shown in Figure 3 in original paper , in sparse-reward settings , although the rewarding region for a single task is small ( dark blue circle ) , the potentially rewarding region can be large ( light blue circles ) . Q2 : I am wondering how their concept of ` decision state ' relates to the idea of fast identification of the reward model . A2 : InfoBot captures invariances shared across goal-conditioned policies , and 'decision states ' refer to states where policies differ greatly and need extra exploration when transferring to new goals . In contrast , MetaCURE finds states where the rewards and transitions differ across tasks , and encourages visitation to these informative states to improve task inference . Q3 : While the experimental analysis shows a slight edge for the latter ( MetaCURE-IG ) , I would say that this might be negligible with respect to the ability of the former to deal with noisy environments . A3 : In the next version of MetaCURE , we will propose a new objective function , from which novel intrinsic rewards will be derived . This new intrinsic reward will be both stable and noise-robust , avoiding the shortcomings of both MetaCURE-IG and MetaCURE-PE . Q4 : The last line of Section 3 says that the proposed intrinsic reward does not vanish over time : Can the authors explain why ? A4 : As shown in Equation 4 and 5 , the intrinsic reward relies on $ z $ , and diminishes if $ z $ is accurate and we have an accurate predictor . However , when adapting to a new task , we do not have enough experiences to acquire a good estimate of $ z $ , and the intrinsic reward is thus not zero . Q5 : Could the authors clarify the experimental setup , especially the number of samples employed in the meta-training and meta-testing phases ? A5 : As stated in the ` Results and analyses ' part in Section 4.1 , the horizontal axis represents number of meta-training examples , and the vertical axis is the final performance after few-shot adaptation . To be exact , we first meta-train the agent ( with millions of samples ) , and then test its adaptation performance with few samples ."}, {"review_id": "RwQZd8znR10-1", "review_text": "This paper proposes a novel meta-learning method , aimed at solving the following problem : at test time , the agent has N episodes to gather information [ exploration phase ] , and we care about its return in the N+1th episode [ exploitation phase ] . To this end , the authors propose to learn a separate exploration and exploitation policy . The core of the algorithm is to use an exploration bonus for the exploration policy that rewards finding novel trajectories . This should help it to collect valuable information during meta training and meta testing . The exploration policy is only used in the N+1th episode , and is conditioned on a context vector which is computed from the exploration trajectories . Pro : - Very relevant subject . - The authors bring up an interesting point , that metaRL methods should consider both exploration during meta training and meta testing . - I think it makes sense to separate exploration and exploitation policy explicitly . - The authors propose to sparsify common metaRL benchmarks . Evaluating your algorithm on environments that are proposed in the same paper can be tricky ( and often means that the empirical results are evaluated more critically ) , but I think the suggestion of looking at sparse metaRL tasks is useful for the field and should be considered by other researchers as well . - The authors provide illustrations of the behaviours of the learned policy at meta-test time , which I think is really nice ! Concerns : - I fee like there 's a mismatch between the reward that the explorer gets , and the problem setting that the authors consider . The way I understand it , the two terms in the explorer 's reward ( Eq ( 2 ) ) can be helpful during meta-training but I do n't see how that translates to meta-test time . Let me try to explain : - [ First term ] The objective of the agent is to maximise the return in the * last * episode ( the exploitation episode ) . Then why is the explorer not maximising the return of the exploitation phase , but instead gets a reward that corresponds to the exploration episodes ? Does n't that contradict the premise that we 're not interested at all in the reward that is collected during exploration ? Also , what is n ( you write `` training iterations '' - is that just the number of environment steps per task ? number of policy updates over the entirety of meta-training ? Does this mean this is annealed to zero over training ? Maybe then it should n't be called $ \\gamma $ so that it 's not confused with the per-episode discount usually used in RL . ) . - [ Second term ] The reward bonus can be seen as a type of novelty bonus for finding new trajectories . Can the authors clarify why this would help ( a ) during meta-training and ( b ) during meta-testing ? I can see how it helps during training , but I do n't understand why it also helps at test time . At the end of Sec 3.2 , you write `` the intrinsic reward is estimated on multiple tasks and does not diminish during meta-training '' . Why not ? In Eq 5 , does $ c_ { -1 : i-1 } $ come from multiple tasks or just one ? Why ca n't this diminish over time , should n't our model $ p ( r , s|x , a , z ) $ ( dropping the subscripts for brevity ) get better over time ? Or do you just mean that the weight $ \\lambda $ is not annealed ? And does n't it have all the information to , in principle , predict r and s exactly ( except for aleatoric noise ) so then this term reduces to the noise in the environment ? Or should the terms in the subscript not match the ones within the expectation ? It 's also a bit unclear what the expectation is over , the subscript just shows some tuples . What 's the probability distribution ? Where do the terms in the subscript come from ? Are $ q $ and $ p^\\mathcal { T } $ mixed in here ? It would help my understanding if these things could be made more explicit . - [ Missing term ? ] I understand the above two terms might help during training , but they are only auxiliary tasks in a way . And if the first term is annealed to zero ( if that 's indeed what 's happening ? ) , and the second term reduces to aleatoric noise ( is that 's indeed what 's happening ? ) , what is the exploration policy even doing at the end of training ? Should there be a third term , which is the return in the * exploitation * phase , which is the only thing that the exploration policy should try to maximise at meta-test time ? - I think the mathematical formulation has to be fleshed out . The paper is sometimes hard to follow because the notation is unclear , and not all terms are explained . I have a few open questions because of this : - What are the expectations in ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) over ? - Not all terms in Figure 1 are defined or mentioned in the text . Are $ L_\\pi $ and $ L_ { Q_\\pi } $ loss terms from SAC , so they correspond to equation ( 1 ) ? And $ L_ { \\pi_e } $ corresponds to equation ( 2 ) ? And what is $ L_ { pred } $ ? All these should be explicitly defined in the text with an equation . - Sec 2 , directly after Eq ( 1 ) : $ c^\\mathcal { T } _ { \\pi_e } $ is not defined . - In Figure 2 , PEARL ( Walker-Vel-Sparse ) and VariBAD ( Point-Robot-Sparse ) seem to first learn and then diverge . Do the authors have an explanation as to why this is ? It seems to me that maybe the hyperparameters just were n't set right , and makes me a bit sceptical of the results . When PEARL/VariBAD * do * learn , their ( end- ) performance is much closer to that of MetaCURE . - The authors propose two versions of MetaCURE ( IG and PE ) . On the continuous control tasks PE is better , but then on the noisy point robot PE completely fails and IG succeeds . I think the authors are not doing themselves a favour by setting up the presentation of their methods like this . It would be better to propose * one * method , and then fully focus on this . The way it is now , there are two methods where neither of them is clearly better . I think that 's confusing to the reader , and less convincing . Should n't there be a way to develop an exploration bonus that can do well across all environments ? - The `` noisy '' environment is a POMDP ( the agent gets noisy state observations ) . So does n't that mean that there is simply a mismatch between the problem setting and the way the policy is set up ? I 'm not sure that this is a good experiment to add , because the solution ( using the PE explorer ) does not directly address the problem ( partial observability ) . Maybe a noisy reward function would fit better here ? Other questions : - Can you explain why the same exploration mechanism useful during meta-training and meta-testing ? Are n't we mixing across-task and within-task information gain , and if so , why is that okay ? - What is the difference between row 1 and row 2 in Figure 2 ? This is not explained in the text . Is that separation just because everything in one figure would 've been too much ? And how exactly were the baselines evaluated , always after the same number of episodes ? - Why is the loss of the explorer not backpropagated through the context encoder ? How does that fit together with `` our intrinsic reward supports end-to-end learning and collect online data for effective task inference '' ? - Why does the exploiter get a sample $ z $ and not the entire distribution $ q $ ? Is that because we assume that all information is there and $ q $ is concentrated anyway ? - You mention that the intrinsic reward of PE is of lower variance . Could you explain why ? Is that a hypothesis ( if so , say so explicit ) or do you have any empirical/theoretical evidence for this ( again , if so , make it explicit ) . Suggestions : - You write that `` efficient exploration of meta-RL needs to consider both training and adaptation phases simultaneously '' . This is a good point and I agree with it , and I think the paper can be improved by fleshing this argument out more . Help the reader understand why this is the case , and what the ( different ) challenges in exploration are during training and testing . One open question I still have for example ( see above ) is why the * same * exploration mechanism is useful during meta-training and meta-testing . Why not separate them ? This should be explained in the paper . In the related work section , you write that prior methods `` utilise policy injected with random noise for meta-training exploration , which is ineffective and empirically fail with sparse rewards '' . This point can be made about almost all prior methods , and should come in the introduction . Then explain intuitively * why * this fails , maybe which an example . Another question I have is , how does the Ishii et al.2002 paper back up this point that this distinction exists ? - The experiments section relies too much on the appendix , and it 's quite unnatural to read it like this . Either I have to jump back and forth between the appendix and the main text , or I have to take your word for what is shown in the results in the appendix . You introduce five continuous control tasks at the start , but then actually only show 3 and the other 2 are in the appendix . I think this section can be improved by focusing on the main important points in the main text , explain this well and mention that more results can be found in the appendix . - Mention in the main text that the sparse setting for Meta-World means you use the success signal only . This is a very difficult setting and is worth highlighting instead of burying it in the appendix . - I think a discussion about what an good/optimal exploration strategy would look like can help the reader understand the problem setting , and what you are trying to achieve . Right now , in Sec 4.3 you write for example that PEARL `` explored less effectively '' because it keeps the belief about the current task throughout an entire episode . That 's not a fundamental problem with Thompson-sampling like methods though , but is quite problem-specific . If the number of adaptation episodes that are available corresponds to the number of possible tasks , then Thompson sampling always does optimal exploration . But , if the number of possible tasks exceeds the number of exploration episodes Thompson sampling fails . Adding discussions like these to understand what type exploration * is * necessary and why your method can achieve it , could strengthen the paper .

What 's - > What are ; 4 . Is MetaCURE 's - > Are MetaCURE 's UPDATE Thanks for your detailed response ! A1 : I see , that makes more sense to me now . I 'm still not 100 % convinced that it might not be better to let the policy entirely meta-learn what a good exploration policy is , and only use the inductive bias ( terms 1 and 2 ) for how to do so for meta-training and anneal those terms over time . This would mean that at test time the only thing that the exploration policy should do is maximise the return in the * exploitation * phase - and basically figure out what the best way to do so is ( so you 'd need the `` missing term '' I describe above ) . But that 's just a hunch , not sure if that would actually work better . A2-A8 : Thanks a lot for clarifying . I 'll keep my current score given all reviewers agree that the work is unpolished in its current form , and because the authors plan to propose a new version of MetaCURE soon . I think this is very interesting and promising work and look forward to reading an updated version in the future !", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "Thank you for your comments . A new version of MetaCURE will be proposed soon to improve novelty as well as performance . Q1 : The way I understand it , the two terms in the explorer 's reward ( Eq ( 2 ) ) can be helpful during meta-training but I do n't see how that translates to meta-test time . \\ & Can you explain why the same exploration mechanism useful during meta-training and meta-testing ? A1 : Our intrinsic reward accounts for exploration in both meta-training and adaptation . The first term of Equation 2 is the extrinsic reward , and is annealed to zero during meta-training . The second term relies on the context $ c_ { -1 : i-1 } $ , which are experiences collected from one task . Note that the intrinsic reward diminishes only if we have an exact task embedding $ z $ , which must be inferred from the current context $ c_ { -1 : i-1 } $ . When the agent tries to adapt to a new task , we do not have enough experiences to obtain an exact $ z $ , and the intrinsic reward is thus not only aleatoric noise , but also considers task uncertainty given the current context . As for meta-training exploration , a simple insight is that the prediction error serves as a kind of curiosity , and encourages exploration in meta-training . Although we can directly optimize an exploration policy in order to maximize the exploitation return , this can be extremely difficult with sparse rewards . MetaCURE addresses this problem by developing an intermediate objective for exploration . Q2 : The paper is sometimes hard to follow because the notation is unclear , and not all terms are explained . A2 : The expectation term $ E_ { ( z , r_i , s_ { i+1 ) } | ( c_ { -1 : i-1 } , a_i ) } $ in Equation 3 , 4 and 5 represents an expectation over $ p ( z|c_ { -1 : i-1 } , a_i ) $ and $ p ( r_i , s_ { i+1 } |c_ { -1 : i-1 } , a_i ) $ . The first term can be estimated by the context encoder $ q_\\phi ( z|c ) $ ( the action can be omitted [ 1 ] ) , and the second term is achieved by sampling from the replay buffers $ B $ and $ B_ { enc } $ . $ L_\\pi $ , $ L_ { Q_ { \\pi } } $ , $ L_ { \\pi_e } $ and $ L_ { Q_ { \\pi } ^e } $ are corresponding SAC loss functions ( $ L_ { Q_ { \\pi } ^e } $ was omitted in Figure 2 for brevity ) . $ L_ { pred } $ corresponds to $ r_ { PE } ' $ in Equation 5 .

Q3 : In Figure 2 , PEARL ( Walker-Vel-Sparse ) and VariBAD ( Point-Robot-Sparse ) seem to first learn and then diverge . \\ & What is the difference between row 1 and row 2 in Figure 2 ? A3 : In Walker-Vel-Sparse , PEARL eventually converges , but can not perform as well as MetaCURE due to its inefficient adaptation exploration . Point-Robot-Sparse requires powerful meta-training exploration , and VariBAD lacks such a metra-training exploration mechanism , which makes it unstable . We separated the training curves into two figures to make it clearer to read . The baselines are evaluated after the same number of meta-training samples , as mentioned in Section 4.1 . Q4 : The authors propose two versions of MetaCURE ( IG and PE ) ... It would be better to propose one method , and then fully focus on this . A4 : We will propose a new objective for MetaCURE , from which we can derive a novel intrinsic reward that avoids the drawbacks of the current intrinsic rewards proposed in this work . Q5 : The `` noisy '' environment is a POMDP ( the agent gets noisy state observations ) . A5 : The noisy environment is actually not a POMDP . As stated in Section 4.4 , the agent 's $ ( x , y ) $ position is not disturbed by noise , and noise is only added to a state variable that is irrelevant to decision making . This setting satisfies the Markov property : given current observation and action , the next observation 's probability distribution is fully determined .

'' ( 2016 ) ."}, {"review_id": "RwQZd8znR10-2", "review_text": "This paper introduces the use of intrinsically motivated exploration in meta-training and adaptation phase in meta Reinforcement Learning . The proposed framework consists of using task-inference , already used in other works like PEARL and VariBAD , and two deep neural networks , trained with an arbitrary off-policy algorithm , respectively for exploitation and exploration phases . I think the paper is well-written and discusses the related literature sufficiently well . The empirical results are significantly better than the considered baselines . Despite these good qualities , I think the major weakness of this paper is the lack of contribution . It looks to me that the major contribution discussed by the authors is the use of intrinsically motivated exploration in meta-training and adaptation , while the use of task-inference has been already proposed in other works and the use of different policy networks for exploitation and exploration is trivial . Considering the intrinsically motivated exploration , I miss the importance of the contribution , since it is already well-known that this technique can be beneficial , especially in sparse MDPs . The intrinsic reward makes sense , but it is not novel , as similar intrinsic rewards have been proposed in VIME and Pathak et al . ( 2017 ) .Experimental results are good , but not well described .

Towards this goal , the paper proposes to use an intrinsic reward ( two versions ) and to learn a separate exploration policy to collect data for faster task inference . Strengths - Approaches to improve sample efficiency in meta-RL would be of interest to the community and are potentially useful to RL practitioners . The proposed technique does not utilise dense rewards during meta-training . The use of intrinsic rewards in this approach possibly helps to overcome an important weakness of some previous methods ( like PEARL or MAESN ) , which find it difficult to use sparse rewards during meta-training and assume access to dense reward in the meta-training phase . The approach outperforms other meta-RL techniques within the given experimental setup . Additionally , the visualisations of adaptation behaviour ( like in Figures 3 and 4 ) were quite helpful in understanding the method . However , I will discuss my concerns regarding the experiments in the subsequent sections . Weaknesses and concerns - The writing and clarity of the paper can be improved . It could be useful to provide additional details to motivate the problem and choice of experimental setting . In the introduction , providing further comments ( or citations ) could justify this claim : \u201c However , these exploration mechanisms are still insufficient in either meta-training or adaptation and underperform in complex sparse-reward tasks. \u201d It would be helpful to provide more details about the proposed method beyond Figure 1 . Is the encoder a recurrent network ? And the meta-predictor is another feedforward neural network ? Regarding the experiments , I would like to better understand the motivation behind the choice of restricting the adaptation phase to 2-4 episodes and then evaluating on the last episode . Is this choice realistic in applications ? It could be worth considering that such a choice does not take into account potentially catastrophic behaviour by the exploratory policy and is closer to best arm identification ( rather than regret minimization ) in the multi-armed bandit setting . It appears that a crucial reason for the better performance of the proposed approach is that it can explore within an episode . The off-policy competitor , PEARL , which uses posterior sampling , keeps its belief fixed for one episode and takes actions accordingly . While the experiments illustrate this weakness of the specifics of PEARL , in principle , there is no requirement in posterior sampling to update and sample from the posterior only once per episode . Since using an intrinsic reward introduces new hyperparameters , it could also be possible to introduce a hyperparameter for the number of steps ( say T ) between which PEARL updates and samples from the posterior . Tuning such a hyperparameter will also allow PEARL to explore within an episode and could make it much harder to beat . It could be informative to see such a comparison . Another main concern is regarding the novelty of the proposed approach since the major off-policy meta-RL component appears similar to PEARL . And as the authors mention in the related work section , similar intrinsic rewards and maintaining a separate exploration policy ( Gurumurthy et al. , 2019 ) have also been studied earlier . Related work - The related work section is missing the original references . For example , the paper refers to recent work related to the use of prediction error as an intrinsic reward : Oh et al . ( 2015 ) , Stadie et al . ( 2015 ) and Pathak et al . ( 2017 ) .However , prediction error-based intrinsic rewards were introduced in 1990 [ b ] . Using information gain as a reward for RL agents to better explore the environment was introduced in 1995 [ a ] . Meta-RL was introduced in 1994 [ c ] .

Q3 : Since using an intrinsic reward introduces new hyperparameters , it could also be possible to introduce a hyperparameter for the number of steps ( say T ) between which PEARL updates and samples from the posterior . Tuning such a hyperparameter will also allow PEARL to explore within an episode and could make it much harder to beat . It could be informative to see such a comparison . A3 : We test updating PEARL every 10 steps on Point-Robot-Sparse , and its performance rises to $ 16.2\\pm 2.3 $ , better than the original PEARL ( $ 11.2\\pm 1.6 $ ) but still underperforms MetaCURE ( $ 24.2\\pm 0.4 $ ) . Also , the hyperparameter $ T $ needs careful finetuning for every task set , while in MetaCURE the intrinsic reward weight does not need extra tuning . Q4 : Another main concern is regarding the novelty of the proposed approach . A4 : We will propose a new version of MetaCURE , in which we propose a novel intrinsic reward that avoids the drawbacks of the two old variants .

The approach is based on learning an exploration policy to quickly discriminate the task at hand , so that to leverage a task-specific policy for exploitation . To do so , it employs an intrinsic reward proportional to the information gain ( or prediction error ) over both the transition and reward models . Finally , the algorithm is evaluated over a set of continuous control domains with sparse rewards . * EVALUATION * The idea of focusing the exploration on identifying the current task , instead of collecting good samples for policy improvements , is quite interesting , albeit not completely novel . Unfortunately , the lacking presentation does not help assessing the real quality of the contributions and the robustness of the experimental analysis , and it make me leaning towards a negative evaluation . However , I believe that a partial overhaul of the paper structure , along with a sharper experimental analysis , would make for a nice contribution to the meta RL community . * DETAILED COMMENTS * C1 ) As noted by the authors , the idea of maximizing information gain over the transition model in a single-environment setting has been presented in VIME ( Houthooft et al.2016 ) , while Zhou et al . ( 2018 ) employs information gain to fast identification of the transition model in multi-environment setting . Thus , the main contribution of this work seems to account also for the reward model in the information gain computation . However , it is not clear to me how this can lead to a significant improvement , especially in sparse-reward settings , where rewards are zero almost everywhere . C2 ) An information theoretic approach to leverage the reward structure in a multi-goal scenario has been previously proposed in ( Goyal et al.InfoBot : Transfer and exploration via the information bottleneck . ICLR 2019 ) . Though the setting is not equivalent , I am wondering how their concept of * decision state * relates to the idea of fast identification of the reward model . C3 ) The paper propose two alternatives reward function , one that essentially normalizes the prediction error with the predictability of the transition ( IG ) , and the other that solely consider the prediction error ( PE ) . While the experimental analysis shows a slight edge for the latter , I would say that this might be negligible with respect to the ability of the former to deal with noisy environments ( as explained in Section 4.4 ) . * QUESTIONS * - Could the authors address the comments above in their response ? - The last line of Section 3 says that the proposed intrinsic reward does not vanish over time : Can the authors explain why ? - The experimental setup describes a very short adaptation phase ( hundreds of samples ) but the subsequent plots are functions of millions of samples . Could the authors clarify the experimental setup , especially the number of samples employed in the meta-training and meta-testing phases ? * ADDITIONAL FEEDBACK * - I would suggest to revise the structure of the paper by focusing on the core ideas first , and to the implementation details later . - I did not find the notation crystal clear , especially regarding the role of the context c , and the indiscriminate use of the words trajectory , episode , experience . To me it would be better to refer as sample every ( s , a , r , s ) tuple and trajectory every sequence of samples from the initial state to the end of an episode . - In my opinion the experimental section could be sharper . I would suggest to focus on a smaller set of domains ( such as one with changing dynamics , one with changing rewards and one with both for the Mujoco set , in addition to the two Meta-World ) and a smaller set of comparisons , and to seek for a clearer illustrations of the benefits of MetaCURE with respect to other methods . - I believe the ablation study to be central in the evaluation of MetaCURE . Especially , I would have preferred to see a convincing assessment of the benefit of computing the information gain over both the reward and transition models , with respect to accounting just for the former or the latter . - I would not claim the performance of Meta-World Push ( Table 1 ) to be significantly higher than PEARL , since the confidence intervals are overlapping . Averaging over more trials might help . - I think the main text relies too much on the Appendix : It is fine to have proofs and derivations out of the paper , but I would not directly comment in the experimental section figures that only appear in the Appendix . # # # # # # # # # # # # # AFTER RESPONSE I would like to thank the authors for the detailed response . I encourage them to keep working on MetaCURE : With some improvements I believe it will provide a valuable contribution to the meta-RL field .", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "Thank you for your comments . A new version of MetaCURE will be proposed soon to improve novelty as well as performance . Q1 : The main contribution of this work seems to account also for the reward model in the information gain computation . However , it is not clear to me how this can lead to a significant improvement , especially in sparse-reward settings , where rewards are zero almost everywhere . A1 : By considering information gain in reward model , MetaCURE encourages exploration on regions that potentially obtain non-zero rewards , which can be much larger than rewarding regions in a single task . As shown in Figure 3 in original paper , in sparse-reward settings , although the rewarding region for a single task is small ( dark blue circle ) , the potentially rewarding region can be large ( light blue circles ) . Q2 : I am wondering how their concept of ` decision state ' relates to the idea of fast identification of the reward model . A2 : InfoBot captures invariances shared across goal-conditioned policies , and 'decision states ' refer to states where policies differ greatly and need extra exploration when transferring to new goals . In contrast , MetaCURE finds states where the rewards and transitions differ across tasks , and encourages visitation to these informative states to improve task inference . Q3 : While the experimental analysis shows a slight edge for the latter ( MetaCURE-IG ) , I would say that this might be negligible with respect to the ability of the former to deal with noisy environments . A3 : In the next version of MetaCURE , we will propose a new objective function , from which novel intrinsic rewards will be derived . This new intrinsic reward will be both stable and noise-robust , avoiding the shortcomings of both MetaCURE-IG and MetaCURE-PE . Q4 : The last line of Section 3 says that the proposed intrinsic reward does not vanish over time : Can the authors explain why ? A4 : As shown in Equation 4 and 5 , the intrinsic reward relies on $ z $ , and diminishes if $ z $ is accurate and we have an accurate predictor . However , when adapting to a new task , we do not have enough experiences to acquire a good estimate of $ z $ , and the intrinsic reward is thus not zero . Q5 : Could the authors clarify the experimental setup , especially the number of samples employed in the meta-training and meta-testing phases ? A5 : As stated in the ` Results and analyses ' part in Section 4.1 , the horizontal axis represents number of meta-training examples , and the vertical axis is the final performance after few-shot adaptation . To be exact , we first meta-train the agent ( with millions of samples ) , and then test its adaptation performance with few samples ."}, "1": {"review_id": "RwQZd8znR10-1", "review_text": "This paper proposes a novel meta-learning method , aimed at solving the following problem : at test time , the agent has N episodes to gather information [ exploration phase ] , and we care about its return in the N+1th episode [ exploitation phase ] . To this end , the authors propose to learn a separate exploration and exploitation policy . The core of the algorithm is to use an exploration bonus for the exploration policy that rewards finding novel trajectories . This should help it to collect valuable information during meta training and meta testing . The exploration policy is only used in the N+1th episode , and is conditioned on a context vector which is computed from the exploration trajectories . Pro : - Very relevant subject . - The authors bring up an interesting point , that metaRL methods should consider both exploration during meta training and meta testing . - I think it makes sense to separate exploration and exploitation policy explicitly . - The authors propose to sparsify common metaRL benchmarks . Evaluating your algorithm on environments that are proposed in the same paper can be tricky ( and often means that the empirical results are evaluated more critically ) , but I think the suggestion of looking at sparse metaRL tasks is useful for the field and should be considered by other researchers as well . - The authors provide illustrations of the behaviours of the learned policy at meta-test time , which I think is really nice ! Concerns : - I fee like there 's a mismatch between the reward that the explorer gets , and the problem setting that the authors consider . The way I understand it , the two terms in the explorer 's reward ( Eq ( 2 ) ) can be helpful during meta-training but I do n't see how that translates to meta-test time . Let me try to explain : - [ First term ] The objective of the agent is to maximise the return in the * last * episode ( the exploitation episode ) . Then why is the explorer not maximising the return of the exploitation phase , but instead gets a reward that corresponds to the exploration episodes ? Does n't that contradict the premise that we 're not interested at all in the reward that is collected during exploration ? Also , what is n ( you write `` training iterations '' - is that just the number of environment steps per task ? number of policy updates over the entirety of meta-training ? Does this mean this is annealed to zero over training ? Maybe then it should n't be called $ \\gamma $ so that it 's not confused with the per-episode discount usually used in RL . ) . - [ Second term ] The reward bonus can be seen as a type of novelty bonus for finding new trajectories . Can the authors clarify why this would help ( a ) during meta-training and ( b ) during meta-testing ? I can see how it helps during training , but I do n't understand why it also helps at test time . At the end of Sec 3.2 , you write `` the intrinsic reward is estimated on multiple tasks and does not diminish during meta-training '' . Why not ? In Eq 5 , does $ c_ { -1 : i-1 } $ come from multiple tasks or just one ? Why ca n't this diminish over time , should n't our model $ p ( r , s|x , a , z ) $ ( dropping the subscripts for brevity ) get better over time ? Or do you just mean that the weight $ \\lambda $ is not annealed ? And does n't it have all the information to , in principle , predict r and s exactly ( except for aleatoric noise ) so then this term reduces to the noise in the environment ? Or should the terms in the subscript not match the ones within the expectation ? It 's also a bit unclear what the expectation is over , the subscript just shows some tuples . What 's the probability distribution ? Where do the terms in the subscript come from ? Are $ q $ and $ p^\\mathcal { T } $ mixed in here ? It would help my understanding if these things could be made more explicit . - [ Missing term ? ] I understand the above two terms might help during training , but they are only auxiliary tasks in a way . And if the first term is annealed to zero ( if that 's indeed what 's happening ? ) , and the second term reduces to aleatoric noise ( is that 's indeed what 's happening ? ) , what is the exploration policy even doing at the end of training ? Should there be a third term , which is the return in the * exploitation * phase , which is the only thing that the exploration policy should try to maximise at meta-test time ? - I think the mathematical formulation has to be fleshed out . The paper is sometimes hard to follow because the notation is unclear , and not all terms are explained . I have a few open questions because of this : - What are the expectations in ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) over ? - Not all terms in Figure 1 are defined or mentioned in the text . Are $ L_\\pi $ and $ L_ { Q_\\pi } $ loss terms from SAC , so they correspond to equation ( 1 ) ? And $ L_ { \\pi_e } $ corresponds to equation ( 2 ) ? And what is $ L_ { pred } $ ? All these should be explicitly defined in the text with an equation . - Sec 2 , directly after Eq ( 1 ) : $ c^\\mathcal { T } _ { \\pi_e } $ is not defined . - In Figure 2 , PEARL ( Walker-Vel-Sparse ) and VariBAD ( Point-Robot-Sparse ) seem to first learn and then diverge . Do the authors have an explanation as to why this is ? It seems to me that maybe the hyperparameters just were n't set right , and makes me a bit sceptical of the results . When PEARL/VariBAD * do * learn , their ( end- ) performance is much closer to that of MetaCURE . - The authors propose two versions of MetaCURE ( IG and PE ) . On the continuous control tasks PE is better , but then on the noisy point robot PE completely fails and IG succeeds . I think the authors are not doing themselves a favour by setting up the presentation of their methods like this . It would be better to propose * one * method , and then fully focus on this . The way it is now , there are two methods where neither of them is clearly better . I think that 's confusing to the reader , and less convincing . Should n't there be a way to develop an exploration bonus that can do well across all environments ? - The `` noisy '' environment is a POMDP ( the agent gets noisy state observations ) . So does n't that mean that there is simply a mismatch between the problem setting and the way the policy is set up ? I 'm not sure that this is a good experiment to add , because the solution ( using the PE explorer ) does not directly address the problem ( partial observability ) . Maybe a noisy reward function would fit better here ? Other questions : - Can you explain why the same exploration mechanism useful during meta-training and meta-testing ? Are n't we mixing across-task and within-task information gain , and if so , why is that okay ? - What is the difference between row 1 and row 2 in Figure 2 ? This is not explained in the text . Is that separation just because everything in one figure would 've been too much ? And how exactly were the baselines evaluated , always after the same number of episodes ? - Why is the loss of the explorer not backpropagated through the context encoder ? How does that fit together with `` our intrinsic reward supports end-to-end learning and collect online data for effective task inference '' ? - Why does the exploiter get a sample $ z $ and not the entire distribution $ q $ ? Is that because we assume that all information is there and $ q $ is concentrated anyway ? - You mention that the intrinsic reward of PE is of lower variance . Could you explain why ? Is that a hypothesis ( if so , say so explicit ) or do you have any empirical/theoretical evidence for this ( again , if so , make it explicit ) . Suggestions : - You write that `` efficient exploration of meta-RL needs to consider both training and adaptation phases simultaneously '' . This is a good point and I agree with it , and I think the paper can be improved by fleshing this argument out more . Help the reader understand why this is the case , and what the ( different ) challenges in exploration are during training and testing . One open question I still have for example ( see above ) is why the * same * exploration mechanism is useful during meta-training and meta-testing . Why not separate them ? This should be explained in the paper . In the related work section , you write that prior methods `` utilise policy injected with random noise for meta-training exploration , which is ineffective and empirically fail with sparse rewards '' . This point can be made about almost all prior methods , and should come in the introduction . Then explain intuitively * why * this fails , maybe which an example . Another question I have is , how does the Ishii et al.2002 paper back up this point that this distinction exists ? - The experiments section relies too much on the appendix , and it 's quite unnatural to read it like this . Either I have to jump back and forth between the appendix and the main text , or I have to take your word for what is shown in the results in the appendix . You introduce five continuous control tasks at the start , but then actually only show 3 and the other 2 are in the appendix . I think this section can be improved by focusing on the main important points in the main text , explain this well and mention that more results can be found in the appendix . - Mention in the main text that the sparse setting for Meta-World means you use the success signal only . This is a very difficult setting and is worth highlighting instead of burying it in the appendix . - I think a discussion about what an good/optimal exploration strategy would look like can help the reader understand the problem setting , and what you are trying to achieve . Right now , in Sec 4.3 you write for example that PEARL `` explored less effectively '' because it keeps the belief about the current task throughout an entire episode . That 's not a fundamental problem with Thompson-sampling like methods though , but is quite problem-specific . If the number of adaptation episodes that are available corresponds to the number of possible tasks , then Thompson sampling always does optimal exploration . But , if the number of possible tasks exceeds the number of exploration episodes Thompson sampling fails . Adding discussions like these to understand what type exploration * is * necessary and why your method can achieve it , could strengthen the paper .

What 's - > What are ; 4 . Is MetaCURE 's - > Are MetaCURE 's UPDATE Thanks for your detailed response ! A1 : I see , that makes more sense to me now . I 'm still not 100 % convinced that it might not be better to let the policy entirely meta-learn what a good exploration policy is , and only use the inductive bias ( terms 1 and 2 ) for how to do so for meta-training and anneal those terms over time . This would mean that at test time the only thing that the exploration policy should do is maximise the return in the * exploitation * phase - and basically figure out what the best way to do so is ( so you 'd need the `` missing term '' I describe above ) . But that 's just a hunch , not sure if that would actually work better . A2-A8 : Thanks a lot for clarifying . I 'll keep my current score given all reviewers agree that the work is unpolished in its current form , and because the authors plan to propose a new version of MetaCURE soon . I think this is very interesting and promising work and look forward to reading an updated version in the future !", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "Thank you for your comments . A new version of MetaCURE will be proposed soon to improve novelty as well as performance . Q1 : The way I understand it , the two terms in the explorer 's reward ( Eq ( 2 ) ) can be helpful during meta-training but I do n't see how that translates to meta-test time . \\ & Can you explain why the same exploration mechanism useful during meta-training and meta-testing ? A1 : Our intrinsic reward accounts for exploration in both meta-training and adaptation . The first term of Equation 2 is the extrinsic reward , and is annealed to zero during meta-training . The second term relies on the context $ c_ { -1 : i-1 } $ , which are experiences collected from one task . Note that the intrinsic reward diminishes only if we have an exact task embedding $ z $ , which must be inferred from the current context $ c_ { -1 : i-1 } $ . When the agent tries to adapt to a new task , we do not have enough experiences to obtain an exact $ z $ , and the intrinsic reward is thus not only aleatoric noise , but also considers task uncertainty given the current context . As for meta-training exploration , a simple insight is that the prediction error serves as a kind of curiosity , and encourages exploration in meta-training . Although we can directly optimize an exploration policy in order to maximize the exploitation return , this can be extremely difficult with sparse rewards . MetaCURE addresses this problem by developing an intermediate objective for exploration . Q2 : The paper is sometimes hard to follow because the notation is unclear , and not all terms are explained . A2 : The expectation term $ E_ { ( z , r_i , s_ { i+1 ) } | ( c_ { -1 : i-1 } , a_i ) } $ in Equation 3 , 4 and 5 represents an expectation over $ p ( z|c_ { -1 : i-1 } , a_i ) $ and $ p ( r_i , s_ { i+1 } |c_ { -1 : i-1 } , a_i ) $ . The first term can be estimated by the context encoder $ q_\\phi ( z|c ) $ ( the action can be omitted [ 1 ] ) , and the second term is achieved by sampling from the replay buffers $ B $ and $ B_ { enc } $ . $ L_\\pi $ , $ L_ { Q_ { \\pi } } $ , $ L_ { \\pi_e } $ and $ L_ { Q_ { \\pi } ^e } $ are corresponding SAC loss functions ( $ L_ { Q_ { \\pi } ^e } $ was omitted in Figure 2 for brevity ) . $ L_ { pred } $ corresponds to $ r_ { PE } ' $ in Equation 5 .

Q3 : In Figure 2 , PEARL ( Walker-Vel-Sparse ) and VariBAD ( Point-Robot-Sparse ) seem to first learn and then diverge . \\ & What is the difference between row 1 and row 2 in Figure 2 ? A3 : In Walker-Vel-Sparse , PEARL eventually converges , but can not perform as well as MetaCURE due to its inefficient adaptation exploration . Point-Robot-Sparse requires powerful meta-training exploration , and VariBAD lacks such a metra-training exploration mechanism , which makes it unstable . We separated the training curves into two figures to make it clearer to read . The baselines are evaluated after the same number of meta-training samples , as mentioned in Section 4.1 . Q4 : The authors propose two versions of MetaCURE ( IG and PE ) ... It would be better to propose one method , and then fully focus on this . A4 : We will propose a new objective for MetaCURE , from which we can derive a novel intrinsic reward that avoids the drawbacks of the current intrinsic rewards proposed in this work . Q5 : The `` noisy '' environment is a POMDP ( the agent gets noisy state observations ) . A5 : The noisy environment is actually not a POMDP . As stated in Section 4.4 , the agent 's $ ( x , y ) $ position is not disturbed by noise , and noise is only added to a state variable that is irrelevant to decision making . This setting satisfies the Markov property : given current observation and action , the next observation 's probability distribution is fully determined .

'' ( 2016 ) ."}, "2": {"review_id": "RwQZd8znR10-2", "review_text": "This paper introduces the use of intrinsically motivated exploration in meta-training and adaptation phase in meta Reinforcement Learning . The proposed framework consists of using task-inference , already used in other works like PEARL and VariBAD , and two deep neural networks , trained with an arbitrary off-policy algorithm , respectively for exploitation and exploration phases . I think the paper is well-written and discusses the related literature sufficiently well . The empirical results are significantly better than the considered baselines . Despite these good qualities , I think the major weakness of this paper is the lack of contribution . It looks to me that the major contribution discussed by the authors is the use of intrinsically motivated exploration in meta-training and adaptation , while the use of task-inference has been already proposed in other works and the use of different policy networks for exploitation and exploration is trivial . Considering the intrinsically motivated exploration , I miss the importance of the contribution , since it is already well-known that this technique can be beneficial , especially in sparse MDPs .

Towards this goal , the paper proposes to use an intrinsic reward ( two versions ) and to learn a separate exploration policy to collect data for faster task inference . Strengths - Approaches to improve sample efficiency in meta-RL would be of interest to the community and are potentially useful to RL practitioners . The proposed technique does not utilise dense rewards during meta-training . The use of intrinsic rewards in this approach possibly helps to overcome an important weakness of some previous methods ( like PEARL or MAESN ) , which find it difficult to use sparse rewards during meta-training and assume access to dense reward in the meta-training phase . The approach outperforms other meta-RL techniques within the given experimental setup . Additionally , the visualisations of adaptation behaviour ( like in Figures 3 and 4 ) were quite helpful in understanding the method . However , I will discuss my concerns regarding the experiments in the subsequent sections . Weaknesses and concerns - The writing and clarity of the paper can be improved . It could be useful to provide additional details to motivate the problem and choice of experimental setting . In the introduction , providing further comments ( or citations ) could justify this claim : \u201c However , these exploration mechanisms are still insufficient in either meta-training or adaptation and underperform in complex sparse-reward tasks. \u201d It would be helpful to provide more details about the proposed method beyond Figure 1 . Is the encoder a recurrent network ? And the meta-predictor is another feedforward neural network ? Regarding the experiments , I would like to better understand the motivation behind the choice of restricting the adaptation phase to 2-4 episodes and then evaluating on the last episode . Is this choice realistic in applications ? It could be worth considering that such a choice does not take into account potentially catastrophic behaviour by the exploratory policy and is closer to best arm identification ( rather than regret minimization ) in the multi-armed bandit setting . It appears that a crucial reason for the better performance of the proposed approach is that it can explore within an episode . The off-policy competitor , PEARL , which uses posterior sampling , keeps its belief fixed for one episode and takes actions accordingly . While the experiments illustrate this weakness of the specifics of PEARL , in principle , there is no requirement in posterior sampling to update and sample from the posterior only once per episode . Since using an intrinsic reward introduces new hyperparameters , it could also be possible to introduce a hyperparameter for the number of steps ( say T ) between which PEARL updates and samples from the posterior . Tuning such a hyperparameter will also allow PEARL to explore within an episode and could make it much harder to beat . It could be informative to see such a comparison . Another main concern is regarding the novelty of the proposed approach since the major off-policy meta-RL component appears similar to PEARL . And as the authors mention in the related work section , similar intrinsic rewards and maintaining a separate exploration policy ( Gurumurthy et al. , 2019 ) have also been studied earlier . Related work - The related work section is missing the original references . For example , the paper refers to recent work related to the use of prediction error as an intrinsic reward : Oh et al . ( 2015 ) , Stadie et al . ( 2015 ) and Pathak et al . ( 2017 ) .However , prediction error-based intrinsic rewards were introduced in 1990 [ b ] . Using information gain as a reward for RL agents to better explore the environment was introduced in 1995 [ a ] . Meta-RL was introduced in 1994 [ c ] .

A1 : The encoder can be any network that effectively deals with sequence inputs , such as RNNs . In the implementation , we utilize SNAIL [ 1 ] as our encoder . The meta-predictor is a feedforward neural network . Q2 : Regarding the experiments , I would like to better understand the motivation behind the choice of restricting the adaptation phase to 2-4 episodes and then evaluating on the last episode . Is this choice realistic in applications ? A2 : The length of the adaptation phase can vary with the specific task set . In application , our method can be applied to scenarios that do not consider exploration costs , such as adapting to new computer games or chess games . Best arm identification shares some similarity with the meta-RL objective , but is restricted to bandit problems . Q3 : Since using an intrinsic reward introduces new hyperparameters , it could also be possible to introduce a hyperparameter for the number of steps ( say T ) between which PEARL updates and samples from the posterior . Tuning such a hyperparameter will also allow PEARL to explore within an episode and could make it much harder to beat . It could be informative to see such a comparison . A3 : We test updating PEARL every 10 steps on Point-Robot-Sparse , and its performance rises to $ 16.2\\pm 2.3 $ , better than the original PEARL ( $ 11.2\\pm 1.6 $ ) but still underperforms MetaCURE ( $ 24.2\\pm 0.4 $ ) . Also , the hyperparameter $ T $ needs careful finetuning for every task set , while in MetaCURE the intrinsic reward weight does not need extra tuning . Q4 : Another main concern is regarding the novelty of the proposed approach . A4 : We will propose a new version of MetaCURE , in which we propose a novel intrinsic reward that avoids the drawbacks of the two old variants .
