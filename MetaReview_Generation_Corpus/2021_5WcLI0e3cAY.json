More importantly , it requires highly-structured and large-scale in-domain data for pretraining , which might not be available in other domains . # Response : It is easy to extend our approach to other domains and others types of knowledge . In our paper , we define four types of knowledge , including e-commerce knowledge-bases , aspects of product entities , categories of product entities , and unique selling propositions ( USPs ) of product entities . We can find similar knowledge and structure in Wikipedia . Each entity in Wikipedia has a corresponding category and a knowledge-base , and the content for each entity is arranged by different aspects . The entity phrases can be regarded as USPs . In addition to our knowledge definition , our proposed pre-training objectives , including knowledge-aware masked language model ( KMLM ) , knowledge-aware masked sequence-to-sequence ( KMS2S ) , product entity aspect boundary detection ( PEABD ) , and product entity category classification ( PECC ) could also be directly extended to Wikipedia . For the product entity aspect summary generation objective , we can obtain summary-like text for each aspect with the approaches in Zhang et al . ( 2020 ) .Existing work on pre-training language models with Wikipedia mostly take the content in Wikipedia as flatted text or only use entity information . Our work presents a new perspective to pre-training language model with structured knowledge in Wikipedia . ( Reference : Zhang , Jingqing , Zhao , Yao , Saleh , Mohammad , and Liu , Peter J. PEGASUS : Pre-training with extracted gap-sentences for abstractive summarization.ICML 2020 . ) # Q2.Abstractive Product Summarization looks very similar to Product Entity Aspect Summary Generation ( PEASG ) in pretraining . It is less clear whether the performance gain comes from the pretraining method or merely a larger training set . Also , have you tried directly using the pretraining dataset in downstream tasks ? # Response : Although Abstractive Product Summarization task looks very similar to Product Entity Aspect Summary Generation ( PEASG ) in pre-training , they are totally two different tasks . The Abstractive Product Summarization task aims to generate a product summary given a detailed product description . It requires the model to sum up the key points in the input text , and produce a complete and cohesive text . PEASG aims to generate an aspect summary for a given product aspect , which consists of more condensed and abstractive USPs beyond the input text . In addition , for Abstractive Product Summarization task , the average length of the product summaries is 79 , while the lengths of the product aspect summaries are less than 10 in general . We have performed experiments with directly using the pre-training dataset in abstractive product summarization task , and the results ( RG-1/RG-2/RG-L ) are as follows : |Pre-training model | Fine-tuning data | Home Applications|Clothing|Cases & Bags| | : - : | : - : | : - : | : - : | : - : | |W/o pre-training|PSUM|24.08/4.13/15.06|27.09/6.97/16.92|33.31/10.46/22.12| |W/o pre-training|PSUM & ASUM|21.37/3.97/13.75|22.07/4.82/14.51|22.04/4.79/14.40| |K-PLUG|PSUM|33.56/12.50/22.15|33.00/11.24/21.43|33.87/11.83/22.35| PSUM and ASUM denote product summarization dataset and aspect summarization dataset ( pre-training data ) , respectively . We can conclude that directly using the pre-training dataset in the downstream product summarization task brings about negative influence on the product summarization models and pre-training with PEASG objective really boosts the performance . # Q3.How are the knowledge-base values and USPs labeled ? Are they directly available from the platform ? # Response : They are provided by the retailers or platform managers and are directly available from the platform . # Q4.For the pretraining dataset and downstream task datasets , each of them is said to be collected from `` a Chinese e-commerce platform '' . Are they from the same or different platforms ? # Response : Our pre-training dataset is from jd.com . The datasets of KB completion and JDDC dialogue are also from jd.com , and the dataset for ECD dialogue is from taobao.com , as stated in the corresponding papers . We have provided the platform name in our revised version . # Q5.What are `` knowledge tokens '' ? Are they knowledge-base tokens and/or USP tokens ? # Response : Yes , they are tokens containing knowledge regarding product attributes and unique selling propositions ( USPs ) . We have explained it in our revised version . # Q6.Human evaluations for multi-turn dialogue . # Response : We have reported human evaluations in our revised version ."}, {"review_id": "5WcLI0e3cAY-2", "review_text": "Overview : The authors introduce K-PLUG , a knowledge-injected language model with domain-specific knowledge for both NLU and NLG tasks . They evaluate their method in e-commerce scenarios . They use five pre-training objectives , including domain-specific knowledge-bases , entities aspects , entities categories , and entities selling propositions . Reasons to accept : * The authors present K-PLUG that pre-trained on Chinese e-commerce data , which contains approximately 25 million textual product descriptions . * The authors evaluate three different downstream tasks , e-commerce KB completion , abstractive product summarization , and multi-turn dialogue , and show good results compared to its baselines . Reasons to reject : * The paper is not easy-to-follow with too many abbreviations . * The main concern of this work is : the comparison to existing works is too weak . As mentioned in Section 2.2 , there are many related works also working on injecting knowledge or retrieving knowledge to improve language model pretraining . For example , KEPLER , SKEP , SenseBERT , and K-ADAPTER . However , the authors do not compare their training objectives/strategies to theirs , it is very hard for us to make a conclusion that which is better . It is not an apple-to-apple comparison . The only baselines to compare within this paper is C-PLUG and E-PLUG . * The dataset used to pre-train the model contains expensive human annotation , which is not scalable . For example , the category labels ( used for Product Entity Category Classification ) and the summary ( used for Product Entity Aspect Summary Generation ) . In other words , this kind of makes the pre-training process like a `` multi-task '' learning approach with human annotations , which in my opinion is hard to collect more data . * The ablation study results that are shown in Table 5 basically suggest that many of the used objective functions are not important and could be ignored as the difference with and without is really marginal ( I am sure some of them are not significantly better and could be the same if the authors tune a bit the hyper-parameters ) .", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "# Q1.The comparison to existing works is too weak . # Response : We have added more comparisons in our revised version . Related works on injecting knowledge in pre-training language models , such as KEPLER , SKEP , SenseBERT , and K-ADAPTER , can only be adopted to natural language understanding tasks , while our model is designed for both natural language understanding and generation tasks . We report more results of recent work on each task . # Q2.The dataset used to pre-train the model contains expensive human annotation , which is not scalable . # Response : The data we used to pre-train the model is produced by retailers without requiring further human annotations . In the real world , these information , like product entities , usually exit in certain form and is easy to access , like there are billions of product entities in total on the e-commerce platform we collect the data from . This work proposed an effective approach to utilize these information for NLG tasks . # Q3.The ablation study results that are shown in Table 5 basically suggest that many of the used objective functions are not important . # Response : Actually , some pre-training objectives may be complementary , e.g. , for the KB completion task . These pre-training objectives have significant impacts on the downstream tasks , especially for Abstractive Product Summarization tasks . Even more interesting is that the most widely used pre-training objective , e.g. , masked language model , contributes the least compared with others , which suggests that NLG-based pre-training objectives is effective for NLU tasks , which is interesting and may suggest further exploration of NLG-based pre-training objectives may be promising for pre-training language modeling ."}, {"review_id": "5WcLI0e3cAY-3", "review_text": "The paper proposes K-PLUG , a procedure for pre-training an encoder-decoder transformer with domain knowledge . A main claimed contribution that domain-specific knowledge is incorporated both in the encoder and the decoder ( as opposed to focusing on the encoder side ) . The case study is e-commerce , where the authors incorporate information from a knowledge base about products . More concretely , the authors propose to apply multiple pre-training objectives adapted to the knowledge source : 1 . Token masking - similar to BERT , where the masked tokens correspond to ` `` knowledge tokens '' rather than randomly selected tokens . 2.Encoder-decoder masking - Again , it is proposed to mask segments of text that cover ` `` knowledge tokens '' . 3.Product Entity Aspect Boundary Detection : tag mentions of ` product aspects ' in the text . 4.Product Entity Category Classification : Associating a given text with the product category 5 . Product Entity Aspect Summary Generation : adapting previous work , this objective generates a summary from the description of a ` `` product entity aspect '' . The approach is evaluated on several language understanding and generation tasks that pertain to the product knowledge source , including product knowledge base completion , abstractive product summarization , and multi-turn dialogue . PROS : - Integrating knowledge in transformer-based model is a topic of interest - The experimental evaluation is solid . The authors compare with previous works , and present sensible ablation results . CONS : - Some details of the approach are under-specified/formulized . The results may therefore not be reproducible . ( see comments ) - The paper is not self-contained ( see comments ) - It is not clear if and how the approach extends to other types of knowledge , outside of the e-commerce and products domain . Detailed comments : - The major difference from BERT is that our KMLM prioritizes knowledge tokens - what are the ` `` knowledge tokens '' ? is it based on lexical match ? does it only include ` `` content '' words ( with no prepositions , for example ) ? is ambiguity accounted for ? is there a preliminary step of entity linking ? - What is a product ` `` aspect '' exactly ? how are ` `` attributes '' and ` `` features '' different ? - The baseline method JAVE is missing a citation - Table 1 : why not report also precision and recall , in addition to F1 ? there seems to be enough space . - Table 2 : note that the bold-faced results are not the best for all columns . - The evaluation tasks are very briefly described .

It is based on lexical match . Most of them are content words . The influence of ambiguous words is limited , because we also allow masking for non-knowledge tokens in the pre-training objectives of KMLM and KMS2S . In addition , ambiguity do not influence objectives of PEABD , PECC , and PEASG . We perform entity linking for product entities . # Q3.What is a product `` aspect '' exactly ? how are `` attributes '' and `` features '' different ? # Response : `` Aspects '' are features of a product , such as the sound quality of a stereo speaker . They are not pre-defined by the e-commerce platform and are presented in the form of a complete text . `` Attributes '' are standardized for a certain product category and are presented as ( attribute , value ) pairs . In most cases , `` features '' are broader explanations of `` attributes '' , and `` attributes '' are more concise `` features '' . # Q4.The baseline method JAVE is missing a citation . # Response : Thanks for pointing this out .

We have performed experiments with directly using the pre-training dataset in abstractive product summarization task , and the results ( RG-1/RG-2/RG-L ) are as follows : |Pre-training model | Fine-tuning data | Home Applications|Clothing|Cases & Bags| | : - : | : - : | : - : | : - : | : - : | |W/o pre-training|PSUM|24.08/4.13/15.06|27.09/6.97/16.92|33.31/10.46/22.12| |W/o pre-training|PSUM & ASUM|21.37/3.97/13.75|22.07/4.82/14.51|22.04/4.79/14.40| |K-PLUG|PSUM|33.56/12.50/22.15|33.00/11.24/21.43|33.87/11.83/22.35| PSUM and ASUM denote product summarization dataset and aspect summarization dataset ( pre-training data ) , respectively . We can conclude that directly using the pre-training dataset in the downstream product summarization task brings about negative influence on the product summarization models and pre-training with PEASG objective really boosts the performance . # Q3.How are the knowledge-base values and USPs labeled ? Are they directly available from the platform ? # Response : They are provided by the retailers or platform managers and are directly available from the platform . # Q4.For the pretraining dataset and downstream task datasets , each of them is said to be collected from `` a Chinese e-commerce platform '' . Are they from the same or different platforms ? # Response : Our pre-training dataset is from jd.com . The datasets of KB completion and JDDC dialogue are also from jd.com , and the dataset for ECD dialogue is from taobao.com , as stated in the corresponding papers . We have provided the platform name in our revised version . # Q5.What are `` knowledge tokens '' ? Are they knowledge-base tokens and/or USP tokens ? # Response : Yes , they are tokens containing knowledge regarding product attributes and unique selling propositions ( USPs ) . We have explained it in our revised version . # Q6.Human evaluations for multi-turn dialogue . # Response : We have reported human evaluations in our revised version ."}, "2": {"review_id": "5WcLI0e3cAY-2", "review_text": "Overview : The authors introduce K-PLUG , a knowledge-injected language model with domain-specific knowledge for both NLU and NLG tasks . They evaluate their method in e-commerce scenarios . They use five pre-training objectives , including domain-specific knowledge-bases , entities aspects , entities categories , and entities selling propositions . Reasons to accept : * The authors present K-PLUG that pre-trained on Chinese e-commerce data , which contains approximately 25 million textual product descriptions . * The authors evaluate three different downstream tasks , e-commerce KB completion , abstractive product summarization , and multi-turn dialogue , and show good results compared to its baselines . Reasons to reject : * The paper is not easy-to-follow with too many abbreviations . * The main concern of this work is : the comparison to existing works is too weak . As mentioned in Section 2.2 , there are many related works also working on injecting knowledge or retrieving knowledge to improve language model pretraining . For example , KEPLER , SKEP , SenseBERT , and K-ADAPTER . However , the authors do not compare their training objectives/strategies to theirs , it is very hard for us to make a conclusion that which is better . It is not an apple-to-apple comparison . The only baselines to compare within this paper is C-PLUG and E-PLUG . * The dataset used to pre-train the model contains expensive human annotation , which is not scalable . For example , the category labels ( used for Product Entity Category Classification ) and the summary ( used for Product Entity Aspect Summary Generation ) . In other words , this kind of makes the pre-training process like a `` multi-task '' learning approach with human annotations , which in my opinion is hard to collect more data . * The ablation study results that are shown in Table 5 basically suggest that many of the used objective functions are not important and could be ignored as the difference with and without is really marginal ( I am sure some of them are not significantly better and could be the same if the authors tune a bit the hyper-parameters ) .", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "# Q1.The comparison to existing works is too weak . # Response : We have added more comparisons in our revised version . Related works on injecting knowledge in pre-training language models , such as KEPLER , SKEP , SenseBERT , and K-ADAPTER , can only be adopted to natural language understanding tasks , while our model is designed for both natural language understanding and generation tasks . We report more results of recent work on each task . # Q2.The dataset used to pre-train the model contains expensive human annotation , which is not scalable . # Response : The data we used to pre-train the model is produced by retailers without requiring further human annotations . In the real world , these information , like product entities , usually exit in certain form and is easy to access , like there are billions of product entities in total on the e-commerce platform we collect the data from . This work proposed an effective approach to utilize these information for NLG tasks . # Q3.The ablation study results that are shown in Table 5 basically suggest that many of the used objective functions are not important . # Response : Actually , some pre-training objectives may be complementary , e.g. , for the KB completion task . These pre-training objectives have significant impacts on the downstream tasks , especially for Abstractive Product Summarization tasks . Even more interesting is that the most widely used pre-training objective , e.g. , masked language model , contributes the least compared with others , which suggests that NLG-based pre-training objectives is effective for NLU tasks , which is interesting and may suggest further exploration of NLG-based pre-training objectives may be promising for pre-training language modeling ."}, "3": {"review_id": "5WcLI0e3cAY-3", "review_text": "The paper proposes K-PLUG , a procedure for pre-training an encoder-decoder transformer with domain knowledge . A main claimed contribution that domain-specific knowledge is incorporated both in the encoder and the decoder ( as opposed to focusing on the encoder side ) . The case study is e-commerce , where the authors incorporate information from a knowledge base about products . More concretely , the authors propose to apply multiple pre-training objectives adapted to the knowledge source : 1 . Token masking - similar to BERT , where the masked tokens correspond to ` `` knowledge tokens '' rather than randomly selected tokens . 2.Encoder-decoder masking - Again , it is proposed to mask segments of text that cover ` `` knowledge tokens '' . 3.Product Entity Aspect Boundary Detection : tag mentions of ` product aspects ' in the text . 4.Product Entity Category Classification : Associating a given text with the product category 5 . Product Entity Aspect Summary Generation : adapting previous work , this objective generates a summary from the description of a ` `` product entity aspect '' . The approach is evaluated on several language understanding and generation tasks that pertain to the product knowledge source , including product knowledge base completion , abstractive product summarization , and multi-turn dialogue . PROS : - Integrating knowledge in transformer-based model is a topic of interest - The experimental evaluation is solid . The authors compare with previous works , and present sensible ablation results . CONS : - Some details of the approach are under-specified/formulized . The results may therefore not be reproducible . ( see comments ) - The paper is not self-contained ( see comments ) - It is not clear if and how the approach extends to other types of knowledge , outside of the e-commerce and products domain . Detailed comments : - The major difference from BERT is that our KMLM prioritizes knowledge tokens - what are the ` `` knowledge tokens '' ? is it based on lexical match ? does it only include ` `` content '' words ( with no prepositions , for example ) ? is ambiguity accounted for ? is there a preliminary step of entity linking ? - What is a product ` `` aspect '' exactly ? how are ` `` attributes '' and ` `` features '' different ? - The baseline method JAVE is missing a citation - Table 1 : why not report also precision and recall , in addition to F1 ? there seems to be enough space . - Table 2 : note that the bold-faced results are not the best for all columns . - The evaluation tasks are very briefly described . Perhaps examples can be given ? with some explanation of how the proposed approach helps ? - Some terms are under-specified : e.g. , ` `` intents '' in Sec.4.2.3.- 'For the retrieval-based approach , we concatenate the dialogue context and use [ SEP ] token to separate context and response . The [ CLS ] representation is fed into the output layer for classification . ' - what is the context ?", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "# Q1.It is not clear if and how the approach extends to other types of knowledge , outside of the e-commerce and products domain . # Response : It is easy to extend our approach to other domains and others types of knowledge . In our paper , we define four types of knowledge , including e-commerce knowledge-bases , aspects of product entities , categories of product entities , and unique selling propositions ( USPs ) of product entities . We can find similar knowledge and structure in Wikipedia . Each entity in Wikipedia has a corresponding category and a knowledge-base , and the content for each entity is arranged by different aspects . The entity phrases can be regarded as USPs . In addition to our knowledge definition , our proposed pre-training objectives , including knowledge-aware masked language model ( KMLM ) , knowledge-aware masked sequence-to-sequence ( KMS2S ) , product entity aspect boundary detection ( PEABD ) , and product entity category classification ( PECC ) could also be directly extended to Wikipedia . For the product entity aspect summary generation objective , we can obtain summary-like text for each aspect with the approaches in Zhang et al . ( 2020 ) .Existing work on pre-training language models with Wikipedia mostly take the content in Wikipedia as flatted text or only use entity information . Our work presents a new perspective to pre-training language model with structured knowledge in Wikipedia . ( Reference : Zhang , Jingqing , Zhao , Yao , Saleh , Mohammad , and Liu , Peter J. PEGASUS : Pre-training with extracted gap-sentences for abstractive summarization.ICML 2020 . ) # Q2.What are the `` knowledge tokens '' ? is it based on lexical match ? does it only include `` content '' words ( with no prepositions , for example ) ? is ambiguity accounted for ? is there a preliminary step of entity linking ? # Response : Knowledge-tokens are tokens containing knowledge regarding product attributes and unique selling propositions ( USPs ) . It is based on lexical match . Most of them are content words . The influence of ambiguous words is limited , because we also allow masking for non-knowledge tokens in the pre-training objectives of KMLM and KMS2S . In addition , ambiguity do not influence objectives of PEABD , PECC , and PEASG . We perform entity linking for product entities . # Q3.What is a product `` aspect '' exactly ? how are `` attributes '' and `` features '' different ? # Response : `` Aspects '' are features of a product , such as the sound quality of a stereo speaker . They are not pre-defined by the e-commerce platform and are presented in the form of a complete text . `` Attributes '' are standardized for a certain product category and are presented as ( attribute , value ) pairs . In most cases , `` features '' are broader explanations of `` attributes '' , and `` attributes '' are more concise `` features '' . # Q4.The baseline method JAVE is missing a citation . # Response : Thanks for pointing this out . We have added the citation in our revised version . # Q5.Table 1 : why not report also precision and recall , in addition to F1 ? # Response : We have reported the results of precision and recall in our revised version . # Q6.Table 2 : note that the bold-faced results are not the best for all columns . # Response : The bold-faced results are the best among methods that use text-only input . We also listed the results of Aspect MMPG , but it takes both images and texts as the input so the comparison to it is not totally fair . And even so , our proposed method achieves comparable results to Aspect MMPG , demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method . We have illustrated that in the title of Table 2 . # Q7.The evaluation tasks are very briefly described . Perhaps examples can be given ? # Response : The examples are given in the Supplementary Material . We have included them in the appendix after the references in our revised version . # Q8.Some terms are under-specified : e.g. , `` intents '' in Sec.4.2.3. # Response : The `` intents '' denote the goals of a dialogue , such as updating addresses , inquiring prices , etc . We have revised our paper regarding the under-specified terms . # Q9.What is the context for `` dialogue context '' ? # Response : The context is the dialogue history , e.g. , previous turns of questions and answers in a multi-turn dialogue session ."}}
