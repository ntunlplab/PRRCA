This same network has also been used in works [ https : //arxiv.org/abs/2003.02237 ] and [ https : //arxiv.org/abs/2010.08508 ] .

Specifically , proving monotonicity for non-isotropic covariates is still open ( Conjecture 1 in the Appendix ) , and we have reason to believe that proving this requires highly nontrivial statements in random matrix theory ( Conjecture 2 ) . The difficulty in these settings arises because we desire * * non-asymptotic * * results , which would be much stronger than their asymptotic counterparts . Some versions of these questions are addressed in asymptotic settings in recent works of [ Mei-Montanari https : //arxiv.org/abs/1908.05355 ] and [ d'Ascoli et al.https : //arxiv.org/abs/2003.01054 ] . - `` can we draw the same conclusion for classification tasks ? `` : We did not theoretically analyze classification settings , but we did test monotonicity for experimental classification settings in Section 5 . It may be possible to analyze optimal regularization in * * asymptotic * * classification settings , building on recent works such as [ https : //arxiv.org/abs/1911.01544 ] and [ https : //arxiv.org/abs/2001.11572 ] . However , these techniques do not directly apply in the non-asymptotic settings considered here . - Thank you for the feedback on the experimental section ; we will improve the clarity of the presentation . - `` 5-layer CNN '' : Note that while this 5-layer CNN is not a ResNet , it is in fact capable of reaching close to state-of-the-art accuracies on CIFAR-10/100 , and is likely to have similar behavior as ResNets . In particular , this network was used in `` Deep Double Descent '' [ https : //arxiv.org/abs/1912.02292 ] where it was observed to have similar behavior as ResNet18s . This same network has also been used in works [ https : //arxiv.org/abs/2003.02237 ] and [ https : //arxiv.org/abs/2010.08508 ] . Thus , we believe that conclusions reached using this 5-layer CNN will carry over to larger and deeper networks as well . - `` Figure 3 '' : We apologize for the unclear figure labeling here . In Figure 3 , the optimal regularization value ( pink highlight ) is always selected as one of the 6 values of regularization in the legend . The pink highlight overlaps the other lines in the figure , which unfortunately obscures them ( we will fix this in the revision ) . For example , for model widths < 25 , the optimal regularization is lambda=0.005 , and then it reduces to lambda=0.003 , etc . We hope we have addressed your questions ; please let us know if there are any additional concerns ."}}
