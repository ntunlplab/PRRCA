The key idea includes two folds : ( 1 ) to align label-wise moment , and ( 2 ) to ensemble multiple feature extractor . Experimental studies on 3 datasets are done to verify the proposed MUTL-EPL . Overall , the paper is well-written . The technical approach is simple and sound . My major concern is on the technical significance of the method . Here are the detailed comments : ( 1 ) One motivation of the paper is that current methods fail to consider the shifts among sources . However , there are some multiple source transfer methods explicitly modelling the inter-domain similarities , e.g. , [ ref1 ] . The paper also misses some important multiple-source references . Please refer to the survey [ ref2 ] for different types of multiple source transfer methods . It would be better to have a comprehensive discussion on the related works . ( 2 ) The proposed label-wise moment matching is not new in transfer . Early subspace based work , e.g. , JDA [ ref3 ] , and latest semantic deep learning based transfer methods , e.g. , [ ref4 ] share the similar idea . ( 3 ) The threshold \\taw is used to obtain the good target labels . On the one hand , it is unclear how this parameter should be set for different transfer tasks . On the other hand , high confidence score does not imply correct target label prediction . Error reinforcement may happen even with a well-tuned \\taw . ( 4 ) The usage of ensemble feature extractor is actually using high complexity to enhance prediction accuracy . The scalability could be an issue of the proposed method , especially considering that multiple source may have extremely large data size . ( 5 ) Sensitivity analyses on the balancing parameters \\alpha and \\beta should be done . ( 6 ) Why data augmentation is done on office-caltech10 datasets ? There are many datasets containing multiple domains with sufficient data , e.g. , office-home , Please use these datasets instead of constructing ` artificial \u2019 real-world dataset . ( 7 ) The baseline methods can be further improved ( please consider [ ref2 ] for more baselines ) . Regarding the current results , MUTLT-EPL performs larger improvements over M3SDA on the 2nd , 3rd , and 4th tasks in Digit \u2013five dataset , while only achieves marginal improvements in other tasks , e.g .. tasks in office-caltech10 dataset . More analyses on the performance difference of different tasks should be discussed . ( 8 ) Based on the ablation study , Mutil-epl-r achieves comparable results with multi-epl , which indicates that the extractor classifier and feature diversifying loss have less importance in the overall objective .

The scalability could be an issue of the proposed method , especially considering that multiple source may have large data size . - Even without ensemble , our method still shows the superiority . Thus , we believe that the model without ensemble learning can be used if there are resource constraint issues . 5.Sensitivity analysis on the balancing parameters alpha and beta should be done . - Because of the time limitation , we could not conduct the sensitivity analysis thoroughly . However , we observed that reducing alpha to 0.0001 in Multi-EPL ( n=2 ) brings great performance degradation : from 83.95 to 78.16 with MNIST-M as the target domain . 6.Why data augmentation is done on office-caltech10 datasets ? There are many datasets containing multiple domains with sufficient data .

Label-wise moment matching or adversarial training ( e.g. , [ 1 ] ) has been a common practice in single-source domain adaptation . The authors simply applies this idea of multi-mode aware domain adaptation to multi-source domain adaptation . Moreover , comparing the first line , i.e. , MULTI-0 , in Table 2 with M3SDA in Table 1 ( a ) , we find that this label-wise moment-matching makes almost no contribution . - The empirical results , especially the ablation studies , do not hold . Pseudo-labeling the unlabeled data in the target domain and using multiple feature extractors can also be easily used by M3SDA and DCTN . Expecting a definite performance boost , I expect the authors to provide such results . Moreover , pseudo-labeling and ensemble learning , however , are not novel ; they are widely adopted techniques and can be easily incorporated into any algorithm , e.g. , M3SDA , for performance improvement . - Even on the dataset Office-Caltech and Amazon Reviews , the performance improvement of the proposed algorithm is minor .

While the results seem promising , the technical contribution is incremental and limited . Meanwhile , more empirical results are needed to validate the effectiveness of the framework . - Strengths : - The paper is well written and easy to follow . - The problem investigated in this paper , i.e. , multi-source domain adaptation , is of significance . - Weaknesses : - The technical contribution of this work is limited . Label-wise moment matching or adversarial training ( e.g. , [ 1 ] ) has been a common practice in single-source domain adaptation . The authors simply applies this idea of multi-mode aware domain adaptation to multi-source domain adaptation . Moreover , comparing the first line , i.e. , MULTI-0 , in Table 2 with M3SDA in Table 1 ( a ) , we find that this label-wise moment-matching makes almost no contribution . - The empirical results , especially the ablation studies , do not hold . Pseudo-labeling the unlabeled data in the target domain and using multiple feature extractors can also be easily used by M3SDA and DCTN . Expecting a definite performance boost , I expect the authors to provide such results . Moreover , pseudo-labeling and ensemble learning , however , are not novel ; they are widely adopted techniques and can be easily incorporated into any algorithm , e.g. , M3SDA , for performance improvement . - Even on the dataset Office-Caltech and Amazon Reviews , the performance improvement of the proposed algorithm is minor .

AAAI 2018 .", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "We appreciate your comprehensive review . Here are the responses for your concerns . 1.The technical contribution of this work is limited . Label-wise moment matching or adversarial training has been a common practice in single-source domain adaptation . - Even though those methods have been exploited for single-source domain adaptation , introducing the strategies to multi-source domain adaptation and enhancing the performance is meaningful . 2.Comparing the first line , i.e. , Multi-0 , in Table 2 with M3SDA in Table 1 ( a ) , we find that this label-wise moment matching makes almost no contribution . - Multi-0 , which aligns moments regardless of the labels , is just the same as M3SDA so it is natural that M3SDA and Multi-0 have the same performance . In order to examine the effectiveness of label-wise moment matching , you should compare Multi-0 and Multi-PL . 3.The empirical results , especially the ablation studies , do not hold . Pseudo-labeling the unlabeled data in the target domain and using multiple feature extractors can also be easily used by M3SDA and DCTN . Expecting a definite performance boost , I expect the authors to provide such results . - As you have mentioned , our methods can be easily used along with the other strategies . We believe it is the strength of our method not the weakness . 4.Even on the dataset Office-Caltech and Amazon Reviews , the performance improvement of the proposed algorithm is minor . - Compared to the performance enhancement that the existing methods have made , the performance improvement that our algorithm has made can not be underestimated ."}}
