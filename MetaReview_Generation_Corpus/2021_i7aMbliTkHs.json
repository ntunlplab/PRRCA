R2 does not find any major flaws of the paper, while R1 expressed concerns in terms of experimental details, ablations, and missing comparison to the state-of-the-arts. R4 expressed a similar concern, while favoring the paper a bit more.\n\nThe AC agrees more with the senior reviewers (R1 and R4) that the paper misses its experimental comparison to the state-of-the-arts. In particular, the AC supports the statement from R4 that \"Some SOTA performances are ignored selectively\" to favor the proposed approach. The missing SOTA includes Slow-Fast as pointed out by R4, X3D as pointed out by R1, and more. For instance, X3D is able to obtain 80.4% top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-400, which is superior to 76.9% of this paper, but is being ignored in the paper. X3D that uses a different strategy to abstract temporal information than this paper is also superior in terms of the FLOPS: X3D gets 79.1% while using almost half of the computation the proposed approach is using. The authors responded by \"X3D uses network architecture search strategy to discover the optimal setting for 3D CNNs\", but this is a misleading statement as X3D does not use any neural architecture search method. The authors argue that their proposed approach might be able to also benefit X3D, but this has not been confirmed and we cannot judge since no quantitative results are provided. In addition, as mentioned, several other standard baselines such as Non-Local R101 (with 77.7% accuracy) and ip-CSN-152 (with 77.8% accuracy) performing better than the proposed approach are missing.\n\nOverall, we find the experimental section of the submitted paper incomplete.", "reviews": [{"review_id": "i7aMbliTkHs-0", "review_text": "This paper presents a new temporal adaptive module ( TAM ) to generate video-specific temporal kernels based on its own feature maps .

As the number of channels of input feature maps will be reduced after first convolution in bottleneck , we use the setting in Figure 2 by default to keep a high inference efficiency , . * * Q3 . * * What if we exchange the order of the local branch and the global branch ? * * R3 . * * The experimental results are as follows : | Models | Top-1 | Top-5 | | : -- : | : : | : : | | TANet | 76.1 % | 92.3 % | | TANet-R | 76.0 % | 92.2 % | The model , termed as TANet-R , exchanges the order of the local branch and the global branch in Equ 2 . We found TANet is only slightly better than TANet-R . This result has also been put into Table 2 in the revised version . * * Q4 . * * More experiments with other backbones should be added . * * R4 . * * According to your suggestion , we have conducted the experiments that incorporate the TAM into other backbones such as ShuffleNet [ 1 ] , MobileNet [ 2 ] , Inception [ 3 ] and ResNeXt [ 4 ] . As shown in the following table : | Models | ShuffleNet V2 | MobileNet V2 | Inception V3 | ResNet-50 | ResNext-50 | | : -- : | : -- : | : - : | : - : | : - : | - | | w/o TAM | 62.2 % | 64.1 % | 71.4 % | 70.7 % | 70.1 % | | with TAM | 67.3 % | 71.6 % | 75.6 % | 76.1 % | 76.4 % | | Detal Acc . | + 5.1 % | + 7.5 % | + 4.2 % | + 5.4 % | + 6.3 % | We can observe that the backbone networks equipped with our TAM outperform their C2D baselines by a large margin , which exhibits the good generalization of our temporal adaptive module . These results have been put into Table 3 in our revised paper , and the detailed discussions can be found in the Sec.4.3 of paper as well . * * Q5 . * * In Table 3 , the proposed method is not compared to the X3D [ 5 ] on the Kinetics-400 dataset . * * R5 . * * Thanks for your reminder , the missing method has been put into Table 4 . X3D uses network architecture search strategy to discover the optimal setting for 3D CNNs , while our TAM focuses on designing new temporal modules . Our TAM is on an orthogonal direction and complementary to X3D , in sense that our TAM could be incorporated into the X3D architecture and X3D could perform NAS based on TAM .
