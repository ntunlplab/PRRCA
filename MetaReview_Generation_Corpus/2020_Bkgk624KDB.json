The approach is shown to outperform alternative exploration strategies on a learning to rank task as well as simulated bandit problems derived from classification tasks. Applying meta-learning to this setting is a novel and interesting approach and appears to have nice results. The main issue with this paper is that the presentation of the algorithm is vague and it is difficult to determine what the algorithm actually does. Here are a few of my main questions: 1. The algorithm is dependent on a function class F and PolOpt which finds an f in F with low expected regret. However, F is not really defined. In equation 1, it appears to directly output an action. Below that, it says \"For example, F may be... mapping user features x in X to predicted rewards for actoins a in [K].\" In Section 5.1, the policy is using a probability distribution over actions from f, the entropy of the predicted probability distribution, and a one hot encoding for the predicted action f(a). What is the class F? Is it predicting a probability distribution and an action? What's the one hot encoding of the predicted action, is that an action sampled from the probability distribution of F? 2. Section 3.1 describes the test time behavior of MELEE. They state the goal is to learn an exploration policy pi, and specifically state that pi can \"not depend directly on the context x\" so it \"only learns to explore and not also to solve the underlying task-dependent classification problem\". However, in the equations, pi is a function of x_t. The algorithm is motivated by the exploration exploitation trade-off problem, however there's no policy doing any exploiting here. When does exploitation happen? Is it a separate policy? How is it trained and when is it used? The decision of when to explore and when to exploit is the key question here and it's unclear how that is happening in this algorithm. It's unclear to me how the algorithm achieves good rewards on the task without any attempt at exploitation. 3. What are the rollouts and expert cost-to-go in this setting? In section 3.2, you say the algorithm asks what would the \"long time reward look like if I were to take this action.\" So are you looking at how that action would affect future exploitation? You say there's an optimal reference policy* which effectively cheats by looking at the true labels. Is this policy taking the action with the highest reward at each state? Or is it looking at the effects of exploration on the learned policy? The start of page 4 says that the \"cost-to-go Q of the expert\" is observed, why would the expert in a bandit have a cost-to-go? In the section on roll-out values, you say that you evaluate the value of taking this action and then assuming all future actions were taken by the expert. But this then precludes there being any effect of this action on the policy and any exploration effect. Are you solely optimizing for the one step reward? In the algorithm, the rollouts computed on line 8 don't appear to be used anywhere. 4. How are the synthetic tasks setup? There are almost no details other than that they are two dimensional and have uniformly distributed class conditional distributions. How are they related to the learning to rank task you perform at the end? How are they related to the other tasks you evaluate on? It seems like the choice of synthetic tasks would be important to what the algorithm learns, so it's important to be clear on what these tasks were and how closely they match the target tasks. It would be even better to show results with different sets of synthetic tasks that are more or less similar to the target tasks. 5. In the results, you say you limit the number of labels to two extremes, 0 and 4. I assume you mean you limit it to just those two labels. What do you do with the other data? Do you drop it or do you map it to these two labels?", "rating": "1: Reject", "reply_text": "We thank the reviewer for the provided feedback .

The training is mainly divided into two steps. In step one, they proposed to train a policy optimizer, which maps features and actions to rewards. This policy optimizer could be used to reveal the most valuable action to take according to the modeled reward. All possible actions and their corresponding values are revealed to the policy optimizer because of the existing ground-truth labels in the synthetic dataset. The policy optimizer would then suggest which action to take. The algorithm takes the action in an greedy fashion, i.e. with probability it will follow the suggestion and with probability it will sample it uniformly at random. The policy optimizer, historical actions and the taken actions are appended to the training set for training the exploration policy in the next step. The procedure in step one is proposed to be done in rounds. In step two, the training set is used for training an exploration policy . During testing, the contexts are drawn from the real world, the policy optimizer will first evaluate the whole history and the exploration policy will generate actions with the input from the policy optimizer and the context. The algorithm suggests the action to explore in an greedy fashion. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a dataset for learning to rank, and 300 synthetic datasets. It shows better performances in most cases. I am critical about the paper because 1) the experiments show that all more recently published exploration methods are worse than weak baselines, for which it lacks enough justification and convincing explanations. 2) the experiments are difficult to understand with only citation to publications. Detailed information of the datasets, tasks, procedures is missing. \u2022 Main arguments The paper is in general hard to follow because of too many citations of the previous works without simple explanations. It refers to the imitation algorithm, AggreVate, which is an instantiate of meta-learning for contextual bandits. Meanwhile, they failed to clarify the difference between the proposed algorithm and the existing one, making the training algorithm part confusing. The major concern lies in the experiment section, I can not see big performance difference between the proposed method and the greedy based methods in Figure 1 (left) as 1) the variances are large 2) there are overlapping . It is surprising to see all recently published method are worse than the classical greedy method. These results may require deeper investigations. In addiction, the used datasets in experiments are mentioned without any details and task definitions, which makes the experiments part unclear and the result not that convincing. Below are some other inconsistencies in the paper: 1. I had a hard time to understand what the function means. In Section 2, is used to map user feature to predicted rewards for actions, i.e. is a function with user features and actions as input and reward as output. However, in equation 1, it only takes user feature as input. In Section 5.1, is called a classifier (I regard it as a variant of function ). Both are not consistent with the mapping definition when first formally defined. This point confuses me so that I cannot fully understand what the POLOPT does as the function is the output of it. 2. By the end of section 2, the paper claims that they used direct method for it simplicity and unbiased property. However, as verified in [1], the direct method is biased with low variance whereas IPS is unbiased with high variance.

How is exploration policy trained? ", "rating": "3: Weak Reject", "reply_text": "We thank the reviewer for the feedback . We believe there is a fundamental misunderstanding of our work . It \u2019 s not true ( as the reviewer states ) that we propose a two-step training algorithm to solve contextual bandit problems . Our goal , as stated in the title , abstract , introduction , and throughout the paper is : \u201c We develop a meta-learning algorithm , MELEE , that learns an exploration policy based on simulated , synthetic contextual bandit tasks \u201d . We focus solely on learning the exploration policy , which can be used with any contextual bandit policy optimizer ( `` POLOPT '' ) to solve the contextual bandit problem . As stated in the approach section 3.1 and further in the experiments section 4 : the output from MELEE is an exploration policy \\pi , which is then fixed and used for exploration at test time as described in 3.1 . At the end of the review , there is a question : How is the exploration policy trained ? We found it striking that this point was raised as the last comment in the review , in \u201c Things to improve that did not impact the score \u201d section . This is the fundamental research question addressed in our paper . In fact , MELEE is an algorithm that is designed to train the exploration policy for contextual bandits . Below we address the reviewer \u2019 s main questions/concerns : 1 ) The reviewer is concerned that our experiments show that recently published exploration methods are worse than weak baselines . ( We report the best results for UCB , Cover , and Cover-Nu ; see sec 5.3 . ) In fact , the strong performance of Eps-Greedy is expected , and has been previously reported in Bietti et al . ( 2018 ) ; Bastani et al . ( 2017 ) .This is also discussed in the paper . 2 ) The reviewer does not understand the experimental setup . The experiments follow standard contextual bandit evaluation settings , and the test time behavior we follow is clearly stated and described in full details in section 3.1 and further in the evaluation methodology section in 5.2 . Even further , we made the code publicly available ( see footnote 1 ) . Response to main arguments : 1 ) There appears to be a fundamental misunderstanding around the relationship between AggreVaTe and MELEE . It \u2019 s not true ( as the review states ) that \u201c AggreVate is an instantiate [ sic ] of meta-learning for contextual bandits \u201d ; in fact AggreVaTe is a generic imitation learning algorithm , that we use to solve the meta-learning to explore problem . ( This this stated in sec 3.1 ) 2 ) The difference between our approach and prior work : no prior work has proposed to meta-learn the exploration policy for a contextual bandit task using imitation learning ( see sec 1 and the related work section 6 for a detailed comparison ) . 3 ) The variance in the results is expected in the contextual bandit setting , but accounted for : We report only statistically significant wins , and run on 300 datasets to ensure the validity of our results . As stated before , the experimental setting is fairly standard in the contextual bandit setting , and is described in sec 3.1 and 5.2 . Further clarifications : 1 ) Many of the greek characters from the review have been deleted , so we made a best attempt to understand what the confusion is about . \u201c F \u201d is a functional class and is defined in sec 2 : \u201c For example , F may be a set of single layer neural networks mapping user features x \\in X to predicted rewards for actions a \\in [ K ] . \u201d The policy optimizer POLOPT is also defined in sec 2 : \u201c The oracle policy optimizer , POLOPT , takes as input a history of user interactions and outputs an f \\in F with low expected regret \u201d . 2 ) Thank you for pointing out the incorrect implication that the direct method is unbiased : we will rewrite this sentence to be more clear and accurate . Regardless , MELEE is agnostic to the type of optimizer used . We welcome suggestions from the reviewer for improving the clarity of the paper . To keep the paper length manageable , we found it necessary to assume that a reader has some prior familiarity with some standard ideas from imitation learning and contextual bandits . If there are aspects of the paper that could be made more clear for such readers , please let us know . Given all the clarifications above ( especially the last comment in the review about training the exploration policy ) , it \u2019 s clear our approach was fundamentally misunderstood . We would be grateful if the reviewer would re-consider the evaluation after the clarifications highlighted above .

We \u2019 ll incorporate the reviewer \u2019 s suggestions to make this section more clear . 3 ) This question has many subparts . a ) Exploitation policy : there is no explicit `` exploitation policy '' -- exploitation happens when \\pi chooses the same action as f ( while exploration happens when it chooses a different action ) . b ) Line 16 : sorry , we 're not sure what happened here ; the reference should be to line 15 ( where \\pi is learned ) c ) Precise definition of \\pi_n : this is the policy learned in the nth round ( per line 15 ) d ) Average policy : the algorithm returns a sequence of policies in line 17 ( { \\pi_n } _ { n=1 } ^N ) ; the average policy \\bar\\pi is the average of these returned policies ( as stated in the theorem statement ) e ) Optimal policy \\pi * : in the `` Roll-out values '' paragraph ( p4 ) , we define the rollout policy to be the one that always chooses the action with the highest reward , which is optimal under the `` all future actions taken by expert '' approach . 4 ) Effect of roll-out / roll-in strategy on regret guarantees : The theorem is stated with respect to some fixed policy \\pi * and holds for any definition thereof ; in our case , \\pi * is defined by the rollout , and achieves maximal reward . ( Note : we just noticed a typo in the statement of the theorem ; the inequality should go the other way , and the + should be a - ... this error occurred because of switching from loss-semantics to reward-semantics . ) For roll-in , we are always rolling in with the most recent learned policy ; if we were using something else , there would be an additional term in the regret bound ( making it worse ) . We appreciate that the reviewer took the time to understand the paper and if there are any specific suggestions for improving the clarity , we would welcome them . Significance of the results at the cost of added complexity : ================================================== First , to clarify the `` test time '' complexity , the pieces that need to be `` shipped '' are ( a ) the calibration and ( b ) the policy ( which is a scikit learn classifier ) . In comparison to \\epsilon-greedy , which takes one line of implementation , this is certainly more complex , but remarkably generalizable given the substantial difference between the synthetic training data and the test settings . It 's seems hard to have lower implementation complexity than epsilon-greedy , but in many ways the learned policy here is much simpler than alternatives like cover-nu and UCB ."}, "2": {"review_id": "Bkgk624KDB-2", "review_text": "\u2022 Summary This paper introduced a meta-learning algorithm for the contextual bandit problem, MELEE, which learns an exploration policy based on simulated and synthetic contextual bandit tasks. The training is mainly divided into two steps. In step one, they proposed to train a policy optimizer, which maps features and actions to rewards. This policy optimizer could be used to reveal the most valuable action to take according to the modeled reward. All possible actions and their corresponding values are revealed to the policy optimizer because of the existing ground-truth labels in the synthetic dataset. The policy optimizer would then suggest which action to take. The algorithm takes the action in an greedy fashion, i.e. with probability it will follow the suggestion and with probability it will sample it uniformly at random. The policy optimizer, historical actions and the taken actions are appended to the training set for training the exploration policy in the next step. The procedure in step one is proposed to be done in rounds. In step two, the training set is used for training an exploration policy . During testing, the contexts are drawn from the real world, the policy optimizer will first evaluate the whole history and the exploration policy will generate actions with the input from the policy optimizer and the context. The algorithm suggests the action to explore in an greedy fashion. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a dataset for learning to rank, and 300 synthetic datasets. It shows better performances in most cases. I am critical about the paper because 1) the experiments show that all more recently published exploration methods are worse than weak baselines, for which it lacks enough justification and convincing explanations. 2) the experiments are difficult to understand with only citation to publications. Detailed information of the datasets, tasks, procedures is missing. \u2022 Main arguments The paper is in general hard to follow because of too many citations of the previous works without simple explanations. It refers to the imitation algorithm, AggreVate, which is an instantiate of meta-learning for contextual bandits. Meanwhile, they failed to clarify the difference between the proposed algorithm and the existing one, making the training algorithm part confusing. The major concern lies in the experiment section, I can not see big performance difference between the proposed method and the greedy based methods in Figure 1 (left) as 1) the variances are large 2) there are overlapping . It is surprising to see all recently published method are worse than the classical greedy method. These results may require deeper investigations. In addiction, the used datasets in experiments are mentioned without any details and task definitions, which makes the experiments part unclear and the result not that convincing. Below are some other inconsistencies in the paper: 1. I had a hard time to understand what the function means. In Section 2, is used to map user feature to predicted rewards for actions, i.e. is a function with user features and actions as input and reward as output. However, in equation 1, it only takes user feature as input. In Section 5.1, is called a classifier (I regard it as a variant of function ). Both are not consistent with the mapping definition when first formally defined. This point confuses me so that I cannot fully understand what the POLOPT does as the function is the output of it. 2. By the end of section 2, the paper claims that they used direct method for it simplicity and unbiased property. However, as verified in [1], the direct method is biased with low variance whereas IPS is unbiased with high variance.

How is exploration policy trained? ", "rating": "3: Weak Reject", "reply_text": "We thank the reviewer for the feedback . We believe there is a fundamental misunderstanding of our work . It \u2019 s not true ( as the reviewer states ) that we propose a two-step training algorithm to solve contextual bandit problems . Our goal , as stated in the title , abstract , introduction , and throughout the paper is : \u201c We develop a meta-learning algorithm , MELEE , that learns an exploration policy based on simulated , synthetic contextual bandit tasks \u201d . We focus solely on learning the exploration policy , which can be used with any contextual bandit policy optimizer ( `` POLOPT '' ) to solve the contextual bandit problem . As stated in the approach section 3.1 and further in the experiments section 4 : the output from MELEE is an exploration policy \\pi , which is then fixed and used for exploration at test time as described in 3.1 . At the end of the review , there is a question : How is the exploration policy trained ? We found it striking that this point was raised as the last comment in the review , in \u201c Things to improve that did not impact the score \u201d section . This is the fundamental research question addressed in our paper . In fact , MELEE is an algorithm that is designed to train the exploration policy for contextual bandits . Below we address the reviewer \u2019 s main questions/concerns : 1 ) The reviewer is concerned that our experiments show that recently published exploration methods are worse than weak baselines . ( We report the best results for UCB , Cover , and Cover-Nu ; see sec 5.3 . ) In fact , the strong performance of Eps-Greedy is expected , and has been previously reported in Bietti et al . ( 2018 ) ; Bastani et al . ( 2017 ) .This is also discussed in the paper . 2 ) The reviewer does not understand the experimental setup . The experiments follow standard contextual bandit evaluation settings , and the test time behavior we follow is clearly stated and described in full details in section 3.1 and further in the evaluation methodology section in 5.2 . Even further , we made the code publicly available ( see footnote 1 ) . Response to main arguments : 1 ) There appears to be a fundamental misunderstanding around the relationship between AggreVaTe and MELEE . It \u2019 s not true ( as the review states ) that \u201c AggreVate is an instantiate [ sic ] of meta-learning for contextual bandits \u201d ; in fact AggreVaTe is a generic imitation learning algorithm , that we use to solve the meta-learning to explore problem . ( This this stated in sec 3.1 ) 2 ) The difference between our approach and prior work : no prior work has proposed to meta-learn the exploration policy for a contextual bandit task using imitation learning ( see sec 1 and the related work section 6 for a detailed comparison ) . 3 ) The variance in the results is expected in the contextual bandit setting , but accounted for : We report only statistically significant wins , and run on 300 datasets to ensure the validity of our results . As stated before , the experimental setting is fairly standard in the contextual bandit setting , and is described in sec 3.1 and 5.2 . Further clarifications : 1 ) Many of the greek characters from the review have been deleted , so we made a best attempt to understand what the confusion is about . \u201c F \u201d is a functional class and is defined in sec 2 : \u201c For example , F may be a set of single layer neural networks mapping user features x \\in X to predicted rewards for actions a \\in [ K ] . \u201d The policy optimizer POLOPT is also defined in sec 2 : \u201c The oracle policy optimizer , POLOPT , takes as input a history of user interactions and outputs an f \\in F with low expected regret \u201d . 2 ) Thank you for pointing out the incorrect implication that the direct method is unbiased : we will rewrite this sentence to be more clear and accurate . Regardless , MELEE is agnostic to the type of optimizer used . We welcome suggestions from the reviewer for improving the clarity of the paper . To keep the paper length manageable , we found it necessary to assume that a reader has some prior familiarity with some standard ideas from imitation learning and contextual bandits . If there are aspects of the paper that could be made more clear for such readers , please let us know . Given all the clarifications above ( especially the last comment in the review about training the exploration policy ) , it \u2019 s clear our approach was fundamentally misunderstood . We would be grateful if the reviewer would re-consider the evaluation after the clarifications highlighted above .
