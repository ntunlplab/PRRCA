However the semi-supervised learning results are not competitive enough. Although the authors mention in the author-response that semi-supervised learning is not the main goal of the paper, the experiments and claims of the paper are mainly targeted towards semi-supervised learning. As the approach for inversion is novel, the paper could be motivated from a different angle with appropriate supporting experiments. In its current form it's not suitable for publication.

It appears sometimes the entropy loss (which is not the main contribution of the paper) is essential to improve performance; this obscures the main contribution.

My rating of this paper would remain the same. ============================================================================================ This paper propose to use the reconstruction loss, defined in a somewhat unusual way, as a regularizar for semi-supervised learning. Pros: The intuition is that the ReLU network output is locally linear for each input, and one can use the conjugate mapping (which is also linear) for reconstructing the inputs, as in PCA. Realizing that the linear mapping is the derivative of network output w.r.t. the input (the Jacobian), the authors proposed to use the reconstruction loss defined in (8). Different from typical auto-encoders, this work does not require another reconstruction network, but instead uses the \"derivative\". This observation is neat in my opinion, and does suggest a different use of the Jacobian in deep learning. The related work include auto-encoders where the weights of symmetric layers are tied. Cons: The motivation (Section 2) needs to be improved. In particular, the introduction/review of the work of Balestriero and Baraniuk 2017 not very useful to the readers. Notations in eqns (2) and (3) are not fully explained (e.g., boldface c).

The main contribution of this paper is supposed to be the reconstruction mapping (6) and its effect in semi-supervised learning. The introduction of entropy regularization in sec 2.3 seems somewhat odd and obscures the contribution.

In Balestriero & Baraniuk, it is shown that any DNN can be approximated via a linear spline and hence can be inverted to produce the \"reconstruction\" of the input, which can be naturally used to do unsupervised or semi-supervised learning. This paper proposes to use automatic differentiation to compute the inverse function efficiently. The idea seems interesting. However, I think there are several main drawbacks, detailed as follows: 1. The paper lacks a coherent and complete review of the semi-supervised deep learning.

The generative approaches based on VAEs and GANs are time consuming, but according to my experience, the training of VAE-based methods are stable and the topology generalization ability of such methods are good. Besides, the feed-forward approaches including [1] mentioned above are efficient and not too sensitive with respect to the network architectures. Overall, I think the drawbacks mentioned in the paper are not common in existing methods and I do not see clear benefits of the proposed method.

For instance, the proposed method should be compared with the discriminative approaches including VAT and [1] in terms of the training efficiency.
