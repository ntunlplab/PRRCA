The authors suggest modeling the mechanism of missing values and perform inference  using amortized importance weighted variational inference and demonstrate the capacities of their approach on many experiments. The paper highlight the trade-off between the complexity of the data model and that of the missing data mechanism. The authors appropriately answer reviewers comments, add new experiments varying the percentage of missing values, and give more details on the methodological part. \nI also think that this is a valuable contribution to the community, that the literature is well covered (the historical statistical litterature and the ML one), and that it provides new insights and methods to tackle this difficult problem. \n", "reviews": [{"review_id": "tu29GQT0JFy-0", "review_text": "This paper proposes an approach to training deep latent variable models on data that is missing not at random .

We address your three points of critique below . C1 : Our main contribution is to provide a general recipe for building and training MNAR models that leverages both the flexibility of deep neural nets and prior information about the missingness process . Regarding the technical novelty of the inference scheme , we believe that our use of the reparametrisation trick both in data space and code space is new , although it is a combination of popular generative modelling tools . C2 : Thanks for pointing out that lack of clarity . Within not-MIWAE , we can use prior information by specifying the parametric form of $ p ( \\mathbf { s } |\\mathbf { x } ) $ , as we explain in Section 3.1 . Take for example the case of a sensor which has a tendency to fail at high levels . This can be incorporated in the structure of the missing model by modelling $ p ( \\mathbf { s } |\\mathbf { x } ) $ as a logistic regression for this specific feature , taking the sensor values as input while trying to predict the corresponding mask values . This is illustrated in the UCI experiments where three levels of knowledge are compared : 1. agnostic , where a fully connected neural network is used as the missing model 2. self-masking , where a logistic regression for each feature is used 3. self-masking known , where a logistic regression for each feature is used and the direction of the sigmoid is supplied as well To make things slightly clearer , we have renamed Section 3.1 : \u201c Using prior information via the missing data model \u201d .

Especially for a study like this , which makes a presumably important and strong contribution to the field of missing data imputation I would recommend to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by a more realistic experimental setting . Another recommendation would be to highlight the advantage of the proposed approach with more synthetic data experiments as in figure 1b , maybe one linear and one non-linear data manifold .
