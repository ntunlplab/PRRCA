The area chair however shares the concerns of the reviewers about the setup and the empirical evaluation:\n- Having one model that can be pruned to varying sizes at run-time is convenient, but in practice it is likely to be OK to do the pruning at training time. In light of this, the empirical results are not so impressive.\n- Without quantization, distillation and fused ops, the value of the empirical results seems questionable as these are important and well-known techniques that are often used in practice. A more thorough evaluation that includes these techniques would make the paper much stronger.", "reviews": [{"review_id": "S1GcHsAqtm-0", "review_text": "In this paper, the authors investigate the accuracy-efficiency tradeoff for neural language models.

While their primary effort to evaluate pruning options and compare points along the resulting tradeoff curves doesn't result in a model that would be small and fast enough to serve, the authors also introduce a clever method (single-rank weight updates) that recovers significant perplexity after pruning. But there are many other things the authors could have tried that might have given significantly better results, or significantly improved the results they did get (the top-line 40% savings for 17% perplexity increase seems fairly weak to me). In particular: - The QRNN architecture contains two components: convolutions alternate with a recurrent pooling operation. The fact that the authors report using a PyTorch QRNN implementation (which runs on the Arm architecture but doesn't contain a fused recurrent pooling kernel for any hardware other than NVIDIA GPUs) makes me afraid that they used a non-fused, op-by-op, approach for the pooling step, which would leave potentially 10 or 20 percentage points of free performance on the table. The QRNN architecture is designed for a situation where you already have optimized matrix multiply/convolution kernels, but where you're willing to write a simple kernel for the pooling step yourself; at the end of the day, pooling represents a tiny fraction of the QRNN's FLOPs and does not need to take more than 1 or 2 percent of total runtime on any hardware. (If you demonstrate that your implementation doesn't spend a significant amount of time on pooling, I'm happy to bump up my rating; I think this is a central point that's critical to motivating QRNN use and deployment). - Once pooling is reduced to <2% of runtime, improvements in the convolution/matmul efficiency will have increased effect on overall performance. Perhaps your pruning mechanisms improved matmul efficiency by 50%, but the fact that you're spending more time on pooling than you need to has effectively reduced that to 40%. - Although the engineering effort would be much higher, it's worth considering block-sparse weight matrices (as described in Narang et al. (Baidu) and Gray et al. (OpenAI)). While this remains an underexplored area, it's conceivable that block-sparse kernels (which should be efficient on Arm NEON with block sizes as low as 4x4 or so) and blockwise pruning could give more than a 50% speedup in convolution/matmul efficiency. - In a real-world application, you would probably also want to explore quantization and distillation approaches to see if they have additional efficiency gains. Overall results of 10x or more wall clock time reduction with <5% loss in accuracy are typical for domains that have seen more optimization for mobile deployment (especially mobile-optimized CNNs like MobileNet), so I think that's entirely possible for your application.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We thank the reviewer for the helpful comments : - The QRNN architecture contains two components : convolutions alternate with a recurrent pooling operation .
