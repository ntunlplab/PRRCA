I do think that this is still ok if the paper brings useful insights for the community even though it does not beat the state fo the art.

In the revised version of the paper we added in particular a paragraph in Section 3 page 4 to clarify that the MDC.mi method we propose provides an asymptotically unbiased ATE estimation if the VAE correctly estimates the conditional distribution of the latent factors given the observations . To strengthen the paper and highlight our contribution with multiple imputation , we have also included in the Appendix of the revised version of the paper the results of other simulations where we vary the number of covariates that highlight the fact that we get unbiased estimates of the ATE when $ p $ increases . Finally , we would like to stress out that there are not so many methods that explicitly consider missing ( covariate ) values in causal inference tasks . The assumptions on the missing values mechanism ( MCAR for Kallus et al. , 2018 ) or on the unconfoundedness ( unconfoundedness with missingness , Mayer et al. , 2019 ) are strong and it is difficult to assess their suitability for a given problem . Therefore we believe that there is room for our proposal which bears an innovative approach for exploiting the latent confounding assumption in the sense that using the multiple imputation approach , we exploit the posterior distribution of $ ( Z|X^ * ) $ instead of only the posterior expectation $ \\mathbb { E } [ Z|X^ * ] $ . - Regarding Figures 1 and 2 : We agree that the directed edge from $ X^ * $ to $ X_ { mis } $ is confusing . It stems from an alternative representation where we used $ X_ { mis } $ and $ X_ { obs } $ , which is classical in the missing data literature . Nevertheless , we agree that the assumptions are clearer without any $ X_ { mis } $ in the graphical representation but only $ X^ { \\star } $ and $ M $ . Consequently , we have modified the graphs in Figure 1 and Figure 2 of the revised version and added also $ Y ( 0 ) $ and $ Y ( 1 ) $ to highlight the unconfoundedness assumption . - About the validity of using Z to predict ATE accurately : Like all methods for ATE estimation , MDC is only valid under some assumptions that we state in the paper , in particular , that there are no other confounding factors between treatment and effects beyond the ( unobserved ) Z factors ( i.e. , that the model shown on Figure 2 is correct ) . Ensuring and evaluating the validity of this hypothesis is unfortunately usually not possible without further assumptions , as for other methods for ATE estimation . If the model is correct , then we added a paragraph ( Section 3 page 4 ) to justify by the MDC.mi estimator is a valid estimator for ATE . - About the training of the conditional response surfaces $ \\mu_0 $ and $ \\mu_1 $ : As explained in Section 4.3.2 , we estimate $ \\mu_0 $ and $ \\mu_1 $ by performing a predictive model of $ Y $ on $ Z $ using either a linear regression or a random forest . - We have corrected all the typos , thank you ."}, {"review_id": "SylpBgrKPH-1", "review_text": "Summary: The paper considers average treatment effect estimation treatment T and an unobserved confounder Z causes the outcome Y with an added constraint that the observed X is a noisy measurement of the underlying Z and some of the entries of observed X are missing at random (MAR). Previous work (Kallus et al. 2018) on similar settings assumed a low rank model connecting Z and X along with some entries missing at random which we do not observe. Further, Y (outcome) is related to the treatment and Z with a linear model. They actually show that matrix factorization techniques with these assumptions form an unbiased estimator for the Average Treatment Effect. There is prior work on doubly robust estimators under ignorability assumptions. In this paper, the authors want to consider general non-linear relationships between Z and X with the same MAR (missing at random assumption) for missing entries. So they fit a latent variable model in the form of VAE to find the P(Z| observed part of X) using a slightly modified version of the ELBO Lower Bound. For missing entries, they just replace those entries by a constant and do the usual VAE fit. After the VAE fit, multiple Z's are samples from the optimized P(Z| observed X) and then used in the doubly robust formula on each Z for estimating the average treatment effect and then finally the estimates averaged over the different Z's. There is an alternative where the conditional mean of the latent variable is estimated from the VAE and used in the doubly robust computation. In many synthetic examples, authors compare this with existing baselines and show that their method improves. Pros: - Baselines compares are comprehensive enough from my perspective. - The paper is well written with clear pointer to existing work on doubly robust estimators with standard ignorability assumptions and the work for the linear, low rank model case by Kallus et al. 2018. Cons: Major Issues - There is no reason to believe that even for the synthetic experiments, that the VAE posteriors would asymptotically yield unbiased ATE's which is provably the case in (Kallus et al. 2018) (of course for their restricted linear model/low rank assumptions). There is no reason to suppose Z's used in eq (9) from the VAE satisfy ignorability even in the asymptotic limit. In this light, the paper in essence just estimates Z's from some latent model that is fit and then use those latents to regress Y and then computes ATE. This seems a natural heuristic to try given such a problem. So I don't find a big methodological novelty. I would be willing to increase my scores if the authors could convince me on this point. - For the LRMF model (Fig 4) the MF approach seems to do as well as the authors proposal and we have a guarantee for the MF case under those linear/low rank modeling assumptions. So the only demonstrated benefit is for the synthetic experiments for Fig 5 and Fig 3 (I agree that it is considerable particularly with large fraction of missing values in Fig 3) in whose settings we dont know about how unbiased it is in the limit. More synthetic experiments with different kind of generative models could be more convincing. - Some real world data set would have been more convincing - although I agree ground truth is hard to come by. Minor Issues: - You have set B=200 for all the experiments for MDC-MI. Do the results change when B is increased or decreased ?? Does variance go down or the bias itself changes with B - This would be a useful insight to have. - There is typo in the ELBO lower bound equation in page 11. There are other minor typos. Please correct for it. - Since the paper is about estimate treatment effect from measurements of an unobserved confounder - it is important to cite - https://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r366-reprint.pdf from the causal DAG literature. - The covariance of X given Z for the DLVM model is not clear - It seems to say exp ( or some matrix vector products) * Identity.

The core challenge is that of confounders not directly observed, and accessible only via noisy proxys, in particular in the missingness. The contributed method relies on using the latent-factor model for multiple imputation in doubly-robust causal treatment effect estimators. As a consequence, it requires the missing at random assumption to control for the impact of imputation. Given that the confounders are not directly assumed, a first approach estimates their effect via an estimate of P(Z|X*) (probability of confounder given observed data), which is then plugged in the doubly robust estimator in a multiple imputation strategy. A second approach uses heuristically the estimated latent confounders as regressors of non interest in a linear-regression model. The approaches are empirically compared to other imputation strategies used as plugins in the doubly-robust estimator. The contributed approach show marked benefits when the problem is highly non-linear. The manuscript is clearly written. I do not have many comments. One concern though is that the VAE comes with a significant amount of hyper-parameters that do not seem obvious to set. This is to be contrasted with other approaches compared to.

The core challenge is that of confounders not directly observed, and accessible only via noisy proxys, in particular in the missingness. The contributed method relies on using the latent-factor model for multiple imputation in doubly-robust causal treatment effect estimators. As a consequence, it requires the missing at random assumption to control for the impact of imputation. Given that the confounders are not directly assumed, a first approach estimates their effect via an estimate of P(Z|X*) (probability of confounder given observed data), which is then plugged in the doubly robust estimator in a multiple imputation strategy. A second approach uses heuristically the estimated latent confounders as regressors of non interest in a linear-regression model. The approaches are empirically compared to other imputation strategies used as plugins in the doubly-robust estimator. The contributed approach show marked benefits when the problem is highly non-linear. The manuscript is clearly written. I do not have many comments. One concern though is that the VAE comes with a significant amount of hyper-parameters that do not seem obvious to set. This is to be contrasted with other approaches compared to. How was the specific architecture and learning strategy of the VAE selected? The simulation settings are somewhat artificial. More simulations inspired from real-life causal scenario would improve the work. I hope that in the final version, the code will be available publicly, and not on request.", "rating": "6: Weak Accept", "reply_text": "Thank you for your positive feedback . - We forgot to indicate in the initial version that we used the default parameters for the VAE as proposed in the implementation of the authors of MIWAE available at \\url { https : //github.com/pamattei/miwae } . We have now added this information in the updated version of our article . - We included results of new simulations where we vary the number of observed covariates in the revised version of the paper ( Figs 6-7 ) . It allows us to highlight even more the good performances of our methods as it leads to unbiased estimates when $ p $ increases . - The code is not public yet just to keep the review process double-blind , but the code will be available on GitHub with all scripts needed to reproduce all experiments , which is crucial for reproducibility of our work . We remove the sentence mentioning the availability of the code `` upon request '' in the revised version of the paper ."}}
