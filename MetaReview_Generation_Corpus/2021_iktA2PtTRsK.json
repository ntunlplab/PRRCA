{"year": "2021", "forum": "iktA2PtTRsK", "title": "Watching the World Go By: Representation Learning from Unlabeled Videos", "decision": "Reject", "meta_review": "This paper was a difficult decision. Overall it seems to be a quality paper, well written and with many experiments, in particular evaluating learned representations across various tasks and datasets. The authors were also quite courteous in their replies which is appreciated. I really like the point the paper makes about video as a natural augmentation and I find that novel amid the recent NCE surge, where most papers rely critically on augmentation. R4 was also very positive about the paper overall concept.\n\nIn terms of paper weaknesses two of the reviewers voted for rejection because the paper ignores existing work on contrastive learning from videos. The authors rebuttal is that they are the first evaluating on images, not on videos. All reviewers also point out limited technical novelty, which the authors acknowledge. Finally, R1 is not very confident about the experiments.\n\nOverall, and after calibration, the appropriate recommendation seems to be rejection.\n\n", "reviews": [{"review_id": "iktA2PtTRsK-0", "review_text": "This paper proposes an idea to use NCE for videos where positive/negative training pairs are created by temporally sampling different frames in the video . The idea is fairly straightforward , there is not anything particularly novel about the approach , other than how the training pairs are created . I think it would have been more interesting and insightful if more ways to generate these pairs were proposed and evaluated . For example , video has many modalities ( e.g. , RGB , audio , optical flow , etc ) in addition to the spatial and temporal dimensions . Exploring ways of creating pairs using multi-modal data would have been more interesting . Experimentally , there are n't really any comparisons to previous self-supervised learning methods . This is a pretty major weakness as it makes it difficult to understand how well this task is doing . Methods like SimCLR provide > 70 % accuracy on ImageNet and others do well on video tasks ( see missing related works below ) . Currently , I 'm not convinced by the experiments . The studies comparing different pretraining data and multi-frame vs. single frame are interesting and show the potential of the approach . There are some missing related works , for example : - `` Cooperative learning of audio and video models from self-supervised synchronization '' , NeurIPS'18 - `` Audio-visual scene analysis with self-supervised multisensory features '' , ECCV'18 - `` Evolving Losses for Unsupervised Video Representation Learning '' , CVPR'20 These works all provide strong performance on unsupervised video representation learning , yet are not mentioned or compared to . Overall , I think the proposed idea is not especially novel and the experiments are n't strong enough to show that the simple idea is good .

We appreciate that you think the idea is straightforward . We view this as a strength of our approach ( as did SimCLR ) . We would like to address several of your comments and correct a few misconceptions . 1.Lack of novelty : True , our paper lacks a large amount of novelty , but we believe the impact shown from our method outperforming other recent popular methods like MoCo V2 gives our paper significant scientific merit . 2.Multi Modalities and missing citations : You are correct that multi-modal learning has its merits and should be addressed . We will add a short section on multi-modal learning to our related works section . However , multi-modal learning has currently not shown the same performance that simpler single image techniques like MoCo V2 and SimCLR have . Secondly , those specific papers you mentioned only show results on video datasets whereas we show improvements on both single image and video datasets . For more on this , see our response to R3 . 3.Missing Experiments : We chose to compare against two very strong baselines . 1 ) MoCo V2 which incorporates the MLP suggestion of SimCLR and subsequently outperforms it , and fully supervised pretrained ImageNet weights . Comparing against every new unsupervised method ( especially those which have not published pretrained models or code ) is a daunting task which we simply did not have the computational resources to do . As noted by the other reviewers , our experiments are actually quite thorough and cover a wide variety of domains in both single image and video tasks ."}, {"review_id": "iktA2PtTRsK-1", "review_text": "The idea of learning representations from video rather than single images is an appealing one with many favorable properties to allow a system to get direct signal on appearance of objects under various natural transformations ( occlusion , lighting , etc ) .

The authors create a dataset based on video with positive pairs for noise contrastive estimation , conduct fairly comprehensive experiments and promise to make their newly constructed dataset available .

Clarity : the paper is quite clearly written for the most part . The dataset section 3.1 seems to have an omitted paragraph , please see point 1 below . Section 3.2 is quite lean and does not stand on its own , but relies heavily on previous work omitting much of the essence . I would recommend spending a bit more time on ensuring it is more rigorously written . See for example my comment 2 below . Originality : the paper is modestly original . It combines two existing ideas - that of using discrimination loss for unsupervised learning of image features , and that of using video based data to allow for rich example of the same data that takes into account real world type transformations . Thus , it is hard to claim more than moderate originality . However , Significance : the improvements over existing baselines are solid , though I would not categorize them as dramatic . Given the originality is also solid , the overall significance is moderate . Comments : 1 . The dataset generation section is strange , did you omit too much ? `` We use the following fast and automated procedure to generate the images in our dataset . Using this procedure , ... '' it almost seems like a few sentences were dropped between the first and second sentences . While the information exists in the appendix , a sentence or two seem to be warranted in the main test . 2 . `` Gradients flow through the positive pairs '' - at this point in the text you have only introduced a loss . The sentence warrants the question of gradients with respect to what ? for rigor , and clarity of exposition , this intuition related statement should come after you talk of what is the parameterized aspect of eq ( 1 ) wrt which gradients are taken ( so after eq 2 is introduced and the idea that the feature representations are captured through learned method , and in particular some reference to the NN you are using.This makes it a bit more complete as a description of the method and presented in a more methodical order . 3.Why would you not remove the option of choosing an anchor and positive as the same image ? seems easy to avoid 4. how do you know if the video does n't contain a shift to a different scene , with different content , thus making the positive actually very different ? 5.Since the representation you provide is supposed to learn representations that are somehow more informed about natural transformations ( occlusion , lighting ) - is there an experiment you can conceive of to test this specific hypothesis ? i think it would both be interesting , and also give insight on whether this is indeed what is being learned .

We strive to deliver the ideas of our paper in an intuitive fashion without overwhelming the reader with unnecessary details ( retaining completeness through appendices ) , and we appreciate that for the most part you think we were successful in this . 2.Removing anchor/positive from the same image pair : This was actually a conscious choice to keep in as it ensures that our method is a strict superset of existing techniques like MoCo . Because we construct our dataset automatically , there may be videos which have poor temporal consistency and are simply too hard to find valuable signal from across different images . This allows us to still use these videos effectively in a single image fashion . 3.Shift to different scene : We do n't , but we have tuned various data collection parameters to attempt to avoid this pitfall . Specifically , the images we choose are separated by 5 seconds each , providing more visual diversity than neighboring frames , but less possibility of total visual independency than 1 minute apart . Furthermore the nature of the potential video pool is somewhat conducive to gathering videos on single subjects . Each video comes from searching a single keyword , and not using videos over 4 minutes in length , so generally they are limited to a single subject matter .

We attempted this via the tracking experiment , but could have been more thorough in our exploration of the failure modes of the various models .
