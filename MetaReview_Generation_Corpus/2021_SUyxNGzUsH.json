They propose a method dubbed Visio-Linguistic Neural Module Network ( VilNMN ) to retrieve spatio-temporal information in a video through a linguistic-based parsed program . In particular , VilNMN first extracts entity references and their corresponding actions in linguistic cues . This information is then being used to locate relevant information in the visual cue to arrive at the correct answer . The proposed method is evaluated on two large scales benchmarks AVSD and TGIF-QA , demonstrating competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods . Comments ( Technical , Major Flaws of this paper ) : ( 1 ) Overall , it is interesting to see neural module network works in such a complex setting as in video-grounded language tasks and I appreciate the efforts of the authors trying to explain the method as detailed as possible . ( 2 ) The use of the mathematical symbols in the paper is very confusing . Normally , upper cases ( capital letters ) are used to denote matrices/sets of vectors while lower cases ( non-capital letters ) are often used to denote vectors . ( 3 ) How did the authors subsample F frames/clips from a video ? In my understanding , there are a lot of frames in a video are blurry or distorted so if you sample them in a random manner , it would greatly affect the performance of object detection ( Faster RCNN in this case ) . Please elaborate more on this . ( 4 ) Subsection 3.1 , in the description of `` when '' module : A_when , i is a vector , not a matrix . Same in the supplementary document . In addition , I am wondering since there are many objects/entities in a video , how would the `` when '' module be able to localize the same object/entity over time given no additional supervision ? I think object tracking would greatly be beneficial in this case . ( 5 ) In the experiments on TGIF-QA : - Why the authors only used ResNet features instead of using similar features as in AVSD ? Spatial-based level features are fine in terms of computations but are less intuitive as I expect the object-based features counterpart and the linguistic entity references represent things at the same level of abstraction . - Honestly , I am skeptical about the results on the TGIF-QA datasets as the gap between VilNMN and the existing methods is very significant . From Table 4 , it looks like motion features ( optical flow , C3D , and the likes ) play a role in tasks containing repetition of actions ( such as count and action ) . I am not sure the reason why VilNMN without the use of any of those motion features could manage to outperform the existing methods with large margins ? - Please provide more analysis on the results on the TGIF-QA as in my understanding even when a model correctly links entities in a question with their visual representations , it does not guarantee that it can arrive at correct answers . For example , in counting task , I would say most of the questions have the same parsed program . How does your model work in this scenario ? Some other concerns : ( 6 ) At the end of the related works , the authors wrote `` In video represented as sequence of images , .... , e.g though average pooling , resulting in potential loss of information '' . This is a big assumption as using average pooling over object proposals is a bad idea as object appearance may vary very little over time in a video and the average pooling would smash the temporal information in the video . If one can properly model object tubelets via object tracking , what written in the paper would n't make sense . ( 7 ) Section 3.2 : The sentence `` ... calculated as softmax scores between an entity P_i and each token in dialogue history '' is mathematically incorrect . What drives the attention weights ? Softmax is a function applying over a set of elements . I would be okay to raise the rating if the authors sufficiently address my concerns during the rebuttal phase .", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We thank R2 for the detailed feedback . We appreciate that the reviewer found this work an interesting method using NMN in complex video-grounded language tasks . Please find below our response : * Concern # 1 : \u201c how would the `` when '' module be able to localize the same object/entity over time given no additional supervision ? I think object tracking would greatly be beneficial in this case. \u201d In our current approach , we pass the outputs from the \u2018 where \u2019 modules applied on all entities/objects into the next \u201c when \u201d module . One motivation for this is that most of the question utterances in dialogues are usually a single sentence length . Each sentence often contains multiple subjects/objects but less than one action-related phrase . As suggested by the reviewer , object tracking might improve the reasoning performance of the reasoning steps between \u2018 when \u2019 and \u2018 where \u2019 modules in this case . We will try to investigate this direction in the future . * Concern # 2 : \u201c Why the authors only used ResNet features instead of using similar features as in AVSD ? \u201d Thank you for your suggestion ! We did not have enough time to report the results using an object-based feature counterpart . We reported the performance using ResNet-152 to fairly compare with the baseline models . For completeness , we will try to report similar results using features such as F-RCNN in the final version . * Concern # 3 : \u201c More analysis on the results on the TGIF-QA \u201d About the results on the TGIF-QA benchmark , our performance gain can be explained as it comes from the linguistic bias decoded as reasoning structure programs . The decoded programs allow more precise neural ( attention ) operations between detected entities/actions and the video features . Specifically , in TGIF-QA , the questions are designed to follow a fixed question type distribution with certain question templates . This makes it much easier for the question parser to parse program structures . In our experiments , using exact-match accuracy of parsed programs vs. label programs to gauge performance of the question parser , our question parser can achieve a performance 81 % to 94 % accuracy in TGIF-QA vs. 41-45 % in AVSD . * Concern # 4 : \u201c ... using average pooling over object proposals is a bad idea as object appearance may vary very little over time in a video and the average pooling would smash the temporal information in the video. \u201d Thank you for your feedback . We added a discussion on the use of object tracking in this part in the related work ( Section 2 ) . Compared to a solution using an object tracking mechanism , our method adopts a multi-step interaction framework between the space-time information in video with entity-action detected in text . * Concern # 5 : Other questions : 1 . \u201c How did the authors subsample F frames/clips from a video ? \u201d We sampled F frames/clips with a striding of 8 frames from a video . 2.Typos and presentation issues : Thank you for your feedback !

In the AVSD benchmark , multiple types of data/modalities are considered ( visual , audio ) and we presented the performance based on different combinations of modalities . For a comparison , we also presented all baseline model performance based on their data settings as well . * Concern # 3 : Typos and presentation issues : Thank you for your feedback ! We fixed some of the errors and will thoroughly check again in the final version ."}, "2": {"review_id": "SUyxNGzUsH-2", "review_text": "Summary : The paper studies the application of neural module network to video-grounded language tasks . They propose a method dubbed Visio-Linguistic Neural Module Network ( VilNMN ) to retrieve spatio-temporal information in a video through a linguistic-based parsed program . In particular , VilNMN first extracts entity references and their corresponding actions in linguistic cues . This information is then being used to locate relevant information in the visual cue to arrive at the correct answer . The proposed method is evaluated on two large scales benchmarks AVSD and TGIF-QA , demonstrating competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods . Comments ( Technical , Major Flaws of this paper ) : ( 1 ) Overall , it is interesting to see neural module network works in such a complex setting as in video-grounded language tasks and I appreciate the efforts of the authors trying to explain the method as detailed as possible . ( 2 ) The use of the mathematical symbols in the paper is very confusing . Normally , upper cases ( capital letters ) are used to denote matrices/sets of vectors while lower cases ( non-capital letters ) are often used to denote vectors . ( 3 ) How did the authors subsample F frames/clips from a video ? In my understanding , there are a lot of frames in a video are blurry or distorted so if you sample them in a random manner , it would greatly affect the performance of object detection ( Faster RCNN in this case ) . Please elaborate more on this . ( 4 ) Subsection 3.1 , in the description of `` when '' module : A_when , i is a vector , not a matrix . Same in the supplementary document . In addition , I am wondering since there are many objects/entities in a video , how would the `` when '' module be able to localize the same object/entity over time given no additional supervision ? I think object tracking would greatly be beneficial in this case . ( 5 ) In the experiments on TGIF-QA : - Why the authors only used ResNet features instead of using similar features as in AVSD ? Spatial-based level features are fine in terms of computations but are less intuitive as I expect the object-based features counterpart and the linguistic entity references represent things at the same level of abstraction . - Honestly , I am skeptical about the results on the TGIF-QA datasets as the gap between VilNMN and the existing methods is very significant . From Table 4 , it looks like motion features ( optical flow , C3D , and the likes ) play a role in tasks containing repetition of actions ( such as count and action ) . I am not sure the reason why VilNMN without the use of any of those motion features could manage to outperform the existing methods with large margins ? - Please provide more analysis on the results on the TGIF-QA as in my understanding even when a model correctly links entities in a question with their visual representations , it does not guarantee that it can arrive at correct answers . For example , in counting task , I would say most of the questions have the same parsed program . How does your model work in this scenario ? Some other concerns : ( 6 ) At the end of the related works , the authors wrote `` In video represented as sequence of images , .... , e.g though average pooling , resulting in potential loss of information '' . This is a big assumption as using average pooling over object proposals is a bad idea as object appearance may vary very little over time in a video and the average pooling would smash the temporal information in the video . If one can properly model object tubelets via object tracking , what written in the paper would n't make sense . ( 7 ) Section 3.2 : The sentence `` ... calculated as softmax scores between an entity P_i and each token in dialogue history '' is mathematically incorrect . What drives the attention weights ? Softmax is a function applying over a set of elements . I would be okay to raise the rating if the authors sufficiently address my concerns during the rebuttal phase .", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We thank R2 for the detailed feedback . We appreciate that the reviewer found this work an interesting method using NMN in complex video-grounded language tasks . Please find below our response : * Concern # 1 : \u201c how would the `` when '' module be able to localize the same object/entity over time given no additional supervision ? I think object tracking would greatly be beneficial in this case. \u201d In our current approach , we pass the outputs from the \u2018 where \u2019 modules applied on all entities/objects into the next \u201c when \u201d module . One motivation for this is that most of the question utterances in dialogues are usually a single sentence length . Each sentence often contains multiple subjects/objects but less than one action-related phrase . As suggested by the reviewer , object tracking might improve the reasoning performance of the reasoning steps between \u2018 when \u2019 and \u2018 where \u2019 modules in this case . We will try to investigate this direction in the future . * Concern # 2 : \u201c Why the authors only used ResNet features instead of using similar features as in AVSD ? \u201d Thank you for your suggestion ! We did not have enough time to report the results using an object-based feature counterpart . We reported the performance using ResNet-152 to fairly compare with the baseline models . For completeness , we will try to report similar results using features such as F-RCNN in the final version . * Concern # 3 : \u201c More analysis on the results on the TGIF-QA \u201d About the results on the TGIF-QA benchmark , our performance gain can be explained as it comes from the linguistic bias decoded as reasoning structure programs . The decoded programs allow more precise neural ( attention ) operations between detected entities/actions and the video features . Specifically , in TGIF-QA , the questions are designed to follow a fixed question type distribution with certain question templates . This makes it much easier for the question parser to parse program structures . In our experiments , using exact-match accuracy of parsed programs vs. label programs to gauge performance of the question parser , our question parser can achieve a performance 81 % to 94 % accuracy in TGIF-QA vs. 41-45 % in AVSD . * Concern # 4 : \u201c ... using average pooling over object proposals is a bad idea as object appearance may vary very little over time in a video and the average pooling would smash the temporal information in the video. \u201d Thank you for your feedback . We added a discussion on the use of object tracking in this part in the related work ( Section 2 ) . Compared to a solution using an object tracking mechanism , our method adopts a multi-step interaction framework between the space-time information in video with entity-action detected in text . * Concern # 5 : Other questions : 1 . \u201c How did the authors subsample F frames/clips from a video ? \u201d We sampled F frames/clips with a striding of 8 frames from a video . 2.Typos and presentation issues : Thank you for your feedback !

We are glad that the reviewer found our approach \u201c a novel neural modular network for video grounding tasks , which can provide interpretable intermediate reasoning outcomes and show the model robustness. \u201d Please find below our response : * Concern # 1 : \u201c I am wondering how you define the modular space ? \u201d We design our modular space on the principle of time-space/spatio-temporal dimension in video . The spatial information in video can be defined as information regarding entities , which inspires us for a \u2018 where \u2019 neural module . The temporal information in video contains information regarding changes from one frame to another . This is a key difference from traditional neural modular network models and we extend the prior approaches with a \u2018 when \u2019 module . While the reasoning structure is simple , it is easier to adapt to different problem scenarios , especially in real world domains such as the AVSD benchmark . Our experiments show that predicted reasoning structures can provide additional bias to generate better dialogue responses . In our qualitative results , we demonstrated both failure and success examples that output responses can be explained by the predicted reasoning structures ( Figure 5 and Appendix D ) . * Concern # 2 : \u201c How do you train the program generation tasks from language ? \u201d We train the program generation tasks through the question parsers . We obtained supervision labels for this task using available linguistic parsers . We then train the parsers as a sequence-to-sequence task , with source sequences as the text inputs ( dialogue context , question of the current turn ) and the target sequence is the program . Please refer to Section 3.3. and Appendix A for more details . * Concern # 3 : \u201c How do you determine the hyper-parameters \\alpha and \\beta ? \u201d The hyper-parameters are fine-tuned during training and we selected the best combination using the model response generation performance on the validation split ."}}
