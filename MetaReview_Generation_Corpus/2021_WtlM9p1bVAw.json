Perhaps we can clear up some details . While classical OOD methods only address the novelty for single data points , these methods can be extended to determine novelty for a batch by taking the mean of the method-specific metric and comparing it to the OOD threshold . For example , the baseline method , IOLfCV , uses exposure average feature-distances to compare with a threshold . In the Appendix , we have mentioned that the mean of the method-specific metric was used `` The mean MSP for all images belonging to an exposure is used to determine novelty '' . However , we will revise the manuscript to make this detail more explicit . During training , incoming exposures are presented incrementally . Each exposure contains data that belongs to a single class . Because iLAP does not have knowledge of the labels , pseudo-labels are assigned incrementally ( 0,1,2 .. ) . To evaluate the model 's performance , a ground-truth mapping ( $ m $ ) is stored to map the pseudo-labels to the ground-truth class ( 0 : cat , 1 : dog , ..... ) . However , because this is an unsupervised setting , it 's possible for the model to falsely create multiple labels for a single class ( 0 : cat , 1 : dog , 2 : cat .... ) . During inference time , if the model simply attributed each exposure to a new pseudo-label , accuracy would result to be 100 % for the respective class . To prevent this , we divide the accuracy of the learner by the number of times the inverse mapping is repeated during inference ( $ \\frac { 1 } { |m^ { -1 } ( y ) | } $ ) .

While an argument can be made that these individual classes are not fine-grained enough , our method was still able to significantly outperform the SOTA distance-based baseline with 96.5 out of the 100 classes discovered . In section 5.3 we describe why the re-training method would be more advantageous in the scenario with fine-grained classes . Re-training with a distinct label allows the learner to identify a separable feature space such that one exists . 2.SOTA incremental learning The goal of our experiment section is to compare our method against unsupervised methods , not supervised . The core contribution of our paper is to introduce a SOTA novelty detection method for an incremental setting and demonstrate its success in the unsupervised incremental learning environment . BiC serves as an oracle to demonstrate that our method was able to perform close to SOTA supervised methods despite the lack of labels . 3.Using class-imbalance as a hack We illustrate in the paper that there is merit in using class imbalance to maximize the performance drop between novel and repeated classes . We initialized the class-imbalance ratio based on 2 datasets ( Fashion-MNIST , Imagenette ) that were different from the benchmarks used for our evaluation ( MINST , CIFAR-10 , SVHN , CIFAR-100 ) . These values were maintained across all experiments and we have shown that it improves performance drastically . 4.Computation Cost Our method requires training each incoming exposure twice , first to detect novelty and then to perform normal IL after acquiring the predicted label .

We appreciate the feedback and will do our best to address your comments . Terminology for figure 2 has been changed to \u201c repeated \u201d and \u201c non-repeated. \u201d The class imbalance ratio represents the proportion of samples used per class from the exemplar versus the number of samples used from the incoming exposure . For example , a $ \\lambda $ of $ .5 $ could mean 60 images used from the incoming exposure , and 30 images per class from exemplars for detection training . At high values of lambda , the accuracies for non-repeated classes would decrease during detection training due to forgetting caused by insufficient samples of previous classes . We have evaluated our model using the CRIB dataset created by Stojanov et al.and have added the results to the experimental section of our manuscript . iLAP was able to perform similarly to IOLfCV in terms of net accuracy , but was able to incorporate ~7 % more classes than the baseline . To further demonstrate the robustness of the class-imbalance ratio , we have utilized the same values , $ \\lambda = .5 $ and $ \\theta = .6 $ . Repetition indeed plays an important role in model performance . Stojanov et al.found that given enough repetitions in the supervised case , the model will eventually reach batch performance . However , their method in the unsupervised setting was unable to reach batch performance . In section 5.2 we illustrate that the primary reason the baseline fails is not due to a higher number of repetitions , but rather the order in which the repetitions occur . In figure 3 , as the model incorporates more and more classes , the distance between features decreases . Because the F-Score is computed over the entirety of the dataset , there is a high chance that the model will mistake repeated classes for non-repeated classes . This is a key reason for the substantial performance gains obtained from using our method . The shift in class-feature distance is largely overlooked by traditional distance-based OOD methods . We have included additional experiments where no pre-training is performed . Our method mitigates catastrophic forgetting by using replay . An exemplar for training is maintained at all times and samples are capped on a per-class basis ( Section 3.1 ) . Because a validation exemplar is also maintained , iLAP is able to self-evaluate its performance at any stage of training ( using pseudo-labels ) . If the performance for a particular class is unable to be satisfied , the class is ultimately discarded to allow iLAP to relearn the class ( Section 3.4 ) ."}], "0": {"review_id": "WtlM9p1bVAw-0", "review_text": "The authors propose a novelty detection module to help unsupervised class-incremental learning .

In brief , this paper proposes interesting idea of having confusion-based novelty detection approach to tackle the unsupervised class-incremental learning , but it needs more experiments and discussions to make the paper more complete and ready for ICLR . I would expect to see the concerns listed above being well addressed in the rebuttal .", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "Thank you for your thorough and detailed review . We appreciate the feedback and will do our best to address your comments . Terminology for figure 2 has been changed to \u201c repeated \u201d and \u201c non-repeated. \u201d The class imbalance ratio represents the proportion of samples used per class from the exemplar versus the number of samples used from the incoming exposure . For example , a $ \\lambda $ of $ .5 $ could mean 60 images used from the incoming exposure , and 30 images per class from exemplars for detection training . At high values of lambda , the accuracies for non-repeated classes would decrease during detection training due to forgetting caused by insufficient samples of previous classes . We have evaluated our model using the CRIB dataset created by Stojanov et al.and have added the results to the experimental section of our manuscript . iLAP was able to perform similarly to IOLfCV in terms of net accuracy , but was able to incorporate ~7 % more classes than the baseline . To further demonstrate the robustness of the class-imbalance ratio , we have utilized the same values , $ \\lambda = .5 $ and $ \\theta = .6 $ . Repetition indeed plays an important role in model performance . Stojanov et al.found that given enough repetitions in the supervised case , the model will eventually reach batch performance . However , their method in the unsupervised setting was unable to reach batch performance . In section 5.2 we illustrate that the primary reason the baseline fails is not due to a higher number of repetitions , but rather the order in which the repetitions occur . In figure 3 , as the model incorporates more and more classes , the distance between features decreases . Because the F-Score is computed over the entirety of the dataset , there is a high chance that the model will mistake repeated classes for non-repeated classes . This is a key reason for the substantial performance gains obtained from using our method . The shift in class-feature distance is largely overlooked by traditional distance-based OOD methods . We have included additional experiments where no pre-training is performed . Our method mitigates catastrophic forgetting by using replay . An exemplar for training is maintained at all times and samples are capped on a per-class basis ( Section 3.1 ) . Because a validation exemplar is also maintained , iLAP is able to self-evaluate its performance at any stage of training ( using pseudo-labels ) . If the performance for a particular class is unable to be satisfied , the class is ultimately discarded to allow iLAP to relearn the class ( Section 3.4 ) ."}}
