For example , a BNN with 5 hidden layers , where the latent dimension at each layer is less than 32 We have added a new Appendix C that studies deeper neural networks : To address request ( 1 ) , we studied a 5-layer , 125-unit network , and we observe good fits to data and qualitatively good agreement of our Gaussian approximation with Monte Carlo ( MC ) simulation using 20k samples ( see the new figure 6a ) To address request ( 2 ) we additionally study a 5-layer , 25-unit network , and we again see good fits and qualitatively reasonable performance of our approximation ( figure 6b ) . For completeness , we include an extreme case : 5-layers , 5-units . In this extreme case we do see we see significantly non-Gaussian output distributions in MC simulation due to failure of the central limit theorem underlying our approximations . Since such narrow networks are not of significant practical importance , we do not see this as a major problem with our method . We thank the reviewer for recommending these studies \u2013 including a demonstration that failure cases only arise in impractically narrow architectures helps to justify our use of the CLT . > ( 3 ) A heavy-tailed variational distribution since the second moment may not be finite The reviewer is correct that our method relies on a variational distribution with finite first and second moments , for which the CLT holds . We have added clarification of these necessary conditions in the text . Note that * only * the first and second moments of the variational distribution are required to compute the reconstruction log-probability in the ELBO ( i.e.only < W > and Cov ( W , W ) appear in equation 3 ) . The precise form of the variational distribution is only required to evaluate the KL term in the ELBO , and therefore it is easy to apply our method to any variational family with finite moments which has a closed form KL with a suitable prior . > ( 4 ) Other nonlinear activations since the Gaussian approximation may not be accurate due to ( generalized ) Berry-Esseen theorem We provide results on the Heaviside and ReLU nonlinearities . Other useful and commonly deployed nonlinearities are ( generally speaking ) \u201c softened \u201d and translated versions of either a Heaviside or ReLU nonlinearity ( e.g.tanh is a soft Heaviside and elu is a soft ReLU ) . Note that the nonlinearity only appears in equations 4 and 5 , where it is being convolved with the Gaussian activation distribution . Since this convolution already softens the hard nonlinearities ( e.g.see the smooth functions plotted in figure 2 ) , changes in the intrinsic the softness of the underlying nonlinearity are qualitatively equivalent to using a hard nonlinearity and adjusting the convolving Gaussian covariance . For this reason , we do not think there will be considerable benefit from exploring other nonlinearities . We believe that any gain is likely not worth the considerable work required to find closed form approximations for the integrals in 4 and 5 for arbitrary nonlinearities . > ( 5 ) A BNN with skip connections since a Bayesian multiplayer perceptron with skip connections is also a feed-forward BNN This was fairly simple to add to our method , and we thank the reviewer for suggesting this nice addition .

Variational lower bound gradients are obtained by approximating the lower bound using Gaussian approximations and moment propagation for network activations, and using a closed form expression for the variational expectation of the log-likelihood, the latter being available for the models considered in the paper. This is an interesting paper. The Gaussian approximations and moment propagation approximations are clever and highly original although the derivation is rather heuristic. There is some empirical support that the approximations work well. The paper is generally well written and clearly motivated in the context of the existing literature.

First, MC approximations of intractable expectations are replaced by deterministic approximations. While this has been done before, the solution here is new and very interesting. Second, a Gaussian prior with length scales is learned by VB empirical Bayes alongside the normal training, which is also very useful. The term \"fixing VB\" and some of the intro is not really supported by the rather weak experiments, done on small datasets and networks, where much older work like Barber&Bishop would apply without any problems. While interesting and potentially very useful novelties are presented, and the writing is excellent, both experiments and motivation can be improved. - Quality: Extremely well written paper, I learned a lot from it. Approximations are tested, great figures to explain things. And the major technical novelty, the expression for <h_j h_l>, is really interesting and useful. - Clarity: Excellent writing until it comes to the experiments. Here, important details are just missing, for example what q(w) is (fully factorized Gaussian?). Very nice literature review, also historical. - Originality: The idea of matching Gaussian moments along the network graph is previously done in PBP (Lobato, Adams), as acknowledged here. Porting this from ADF to VB gives dDVI. PBP also has the property that a DL system gives you the gradients. Having said that, I think dDVI may be more useful than PBP. While Barber&BIshop 98 is cited, they miss the expression for <h_j h_l> in there. Now, what is done here, is more elegant, does not need 1D quadrature. - Significance: Judging from the existing experiments, the significance may be rather small, *if one only looks at test log likelihood*. I'd still give this the benefit of the doubt, as in particular dDVI could be really interesting at large scale as well. But the authors may tone down their language a bit. To increase significance, I recommend to comment beyond just test log likelihood scores. For example: - Does the optimization become simpler, less tuning required, more automatic? Would one not expect so, given you make a big point out of reducing variance? Does it converge faster? - Can you do something with your posterior that normal DNN methods cannot do? Better decisions (bandits, active learning, HPO)? Continual learning? In the end, who really cares about test log likelihood? Experiments: - What is the q(w) family being used here? Fully factorized Gaussian? I suppose so for dDVI. But for DVI? Not said anywhere, in main paper or Appendix - A bit disappointing. Why not evaluate at least dDVI with diagonal q(w) on some much larger models and datasets? Why not quote numbers on speed and robustness of learning, etc? Show what you really gain by reducing the variance. - Experiments are OK, but on pretty small datasets, and for single hidden layer NNs. On such data and models, the Barber&Bishop 98 method could be run as well - Was MCVI run with re-parameterization? This is really important. If not, this would be an important missing comparison. Please be clear in the main text - Advantages over MCVI are not very large. At least, dDVI should be faster to converge than MCVI. Can you say something about robustness of training? Is it easier to train dDVI than MCVI? - Why not show the PBP-1 results, comparing to dDVI, in the main text? Are they obtained with the same model? dDVI is doing better. Other points: - Please acknowledge the <h_j h_l> expression in Barber&Bishop 98. Yours is more elegant and faster (does not need 1D quadrature) - Relation to PBP: Note that dDVI has an advantage in practice. With PBP, I need to compute gradients for every datapoint. In dDVI, I can do mini-batch updates. - I just *love* the header \"Wild approximations\". I tend to refer to this kind of work as \"weak analogies\".

Standard training of DNNs which returns point-parameter estimates ( i ) results in poorly calibrated predictive uncertainty estimates ( notably predictions are often confidently wrong ) , ( ii ) does not support model-based sequential decision making ( e.g.active learning ) , and ( iii ) suffers from catastrophic forgetting when trained in the continual learning setting . BNNs have been shown to substantially improve upon standard models / training in these three settings ( see e.g . [ 1,2,3 ] ) .The new innovations proposed in this paper will be applied to these areas in future work . In the second two application areas \u2013 sequential decision making and continual learning \u2013 approximate Bayesian inference must be run as an inner loop of a larger algorithm . This requires a robust and automated version of BNN training : this is precisely where we believe the innovations in this paper will have large impact since they pave the way to automated and robust deployment of BBNs that do not involve an expert in-the-loop . We have included these points as motivational future work items in the paper conclusion . > what is q ( w ) [ the variational family used in the experiments ] ? Our method is not limited to fully factorized Gaussian variational distributions ( any distribution with a tractable first and second moment could be used ) . However , for computational simplicity , our experiments do use a fully factorized Gaussian q ( w ) . We have added this detail to the experimental section . > Why not evaluate at least dDVI with diagonal q ( w ) on some much larger models and datasets ?

Are they obtained with the same model ? dDVI is doing better . Table 3 is too large to be included in the main text and although we perform comparison with PBP using the same model , we don \u2019 t want to move the results to the main text because our method has clear qualitative advantages over PBP as you highlight : 1 ) we handle batches of data and do not have to process one data point at a time , 2 ) we account for correlations in the forward pass and in the posterior distribution and 3 ) we can account for heteroskedastic noise .

Fully factorized Gaussian? I suppose so for dDVI. But for DVI? Not said anywhere, in main paper or Appendix - A bit disappointing. Why not evaluate at least dDVI with diagonal q(w) on some much larger models and datasets? Why not quote numbers on speed and robustness of learning, etc? Show what you really gain by reducing the variance. - Experiments are OK, but on pretty small datasets, and for single hidden layer NNs. On such data and models, the Barber&Bishop 98 method could be run as well - Was MCVI run with re-parameterization? This is really important. If not, this would be an important missing comparison. Please be clear in the main text - Advantages over MCVI are not very large. At least, dDVI should be faster to converge than MCVI. Can you say something about robustness of training? Is it easier to train dDVI than MCVI? - Why not show the PBP-1 results, comparing to dDVI, in the main text? Are they obtained with the same model? dDVI is doing better. Other points: - Please acknowledge the <h_j h_l> expression in Barber&Bishop 98. Yours is more elegant and faster (does not need 1D quadrature) - Relation to PBP: Note that dDVI has an advantage in practice. With PBP, I need to compute gradients for every datapoint. In dDVI, I can do mini-batch updates. - I just *love* the header \"Wild approximations\". I tend to refer to this kind of work as \"weak analogies\".

Standard training of DNNs which returns point-parameter estimates ( i ) results in poorly calibrated predictive uncertainty estimates ( notably predictions are often confidently wrong ) , ( ii ) does not support model-based sequential decision making ( e.g.active learning ) , and ( iii ) suffers from catastrophic forgetting when trained in the continual learning setting . BNNs have been shown to substantially improve upon standard models / training in these three settings ( see e.g . [ 1,2,3 ] ) .The new innovations proposed in this paper will be applied to these areas in future work . In the second two application areas \u2013 sequential decision making and continual learning \u2013 approximate Bayesian inference must be run as an inner loop of a larger algorithm . This requires a robust and automated version of BNN training : this is precisely where we believe the innovations in this paper will have large impact since they pave the way to automated and robust deployment of BBNs that do not involve an expert in-the-loop . We have included these points as motivational future work items in the paper conclusion . > what is q ( w ) [ the variational family used in the experiments ] ? Our method is not limited to fully factorized Gaussian variational distributions ( any distribution with a tractable first and second moment could be used ) . However , for computational simplicity , our experiments do use a fully factorized Gaussian q ( w ) . We have added this detail to the experimental section . > Why not evaluate at least dDVI with diagonal q ( w ) on some much larger models and datasets ? We have added an appendix C that evaluates the performance of DVI in larger models including deep networks with skip connections . Regarding larger datasets , our evaluation focuses on assessing the robustness of the new methods and how automatic they are . The experiments do consider nine different datasets , following established practice for evaluating new approximate inference methods for BNNs ( see e.g . [ 4,5,6 ] ) .We evaluate the proposed methods using many of different model variants ( hetero vs homoscedastic , MC vs different deterministic approximations , different prior settings , various methods for parameterising the variance , etc . ) . In this way we have prioritized a comprehensive assessment of the myriad design decisions , rather than assessing a relatively small number of design decisions on a larger number of datasets . Whilst we acknowledge that since the benchmarks are relatively simple this work is just a first step of a completely comprehensive evaluation , we believe that the experiments provide a solid foundation for this longer-term enterprise . > Was MCVI run with re-parameterization ? We run vanilla MCVI , and re-parameterization is discussed in section E of the appendix and results using re-parameterization appear in Table 3 . We have added this clarification and pointers to section E in the main text . > Relation to PBP : Note that dDVI has an advantage in practice\u2026 Why not show the PBP-1 results , comparing to dDVI , in the main text ? Are they obtained with the same model ? dDVI is doing better . Table 3 is too large to be included in the main text and although we perform comparison with PBP using the same model , we don \u2019 t want to move the results to the main text because our method has clear qualitative advantages over PBP as you highlight : 1 ) we handle batches of data and do not have to process one data point at a time , 2 ) we account for correlations in the forward pass and in the posterior distribution and 3 ) we can account for heteroskedastic noise . We have clarified these advantages in the related work section . > Compare against [ dropout-like methods ] , and show it really does not work ?
