The updated draft look cleaner and conveys the value of the proposal better. I am changing my assessment to \"6: Weak Accept\" (the smallest jump from 3 is to 6 in the portal. I would choose a 5 if that was possible). My concerns for the significance of results and lack of a baseline that takes worker quality into account still stand, but the results look better and the authors make a more convincing case prompting me to change my rating. --------------------------- In this paper, the authors propose a way to measure a notion of surprise (disparity between prior and posterior) and using that as a classification rule. So, if the posterior for a class is larger than its prior, the method outputs that class label. In order to estimate the average prior for a pool of models, the method recommends building additional models to predict these \u201cpeer-priors\u201d, whereas the posterior is simply estimated by a maximum likelihood model (P(y=1) = Indicator(y=1)/K). The authors also propose a variant that directly tries to predict when the majority answer might be wrong. The authors show that such methods can do better than majority voting and some ensemble methods on a few datasets. The paper looks at an interesting problem of when a majority vote response might be wrong by extending the notion of surprise previously defined for human labelers to machine learning models. The strong points of the paper: 1. Simple and interpretable extension of a previously studied method. 2. The method can be plugged into existing frameworks to replace majority voting. 3. The results on the datasets considered seem good. Here are some of my concerns: 1. The baseline of majority voting is fairly weak, since there are several models that take worker quality into account when aggregating responses. For example, the classic Dawid-Skene (1979) model. It\u2019s not very promising to see a model just beat majority voting. 2. The presentation of results in Table 1 and 2 can be improved. Even though it\u2019s good to know how many predictions were corrected, it will also be good to see the overall accuracy numbers (like the ones Table 3). 3. DMTS doesn\u2019t really have the same underlying machinery as HMTS, since it doesn\u2019t operate on the surprise measure, and putting them together in the same paper dilutes the focus. 4. What are the weights in the weighted majority? 5. The results in Table 3 show that HMTS is better than other ensemble methods but only marginally. Since HMTS uses more complex intermediate models (MLPs), I am not convinced whether the small improvement is from the proposed method or just more expressive models. For example, what would happen if the base classifiers in Adaboost were MLPs? 6. How is minority defined in multi-class scenario? 7. Minor formatting and grammatical issues: \u201clikely to the correct\u201d, \u201cmajority is tending to be correct\u201d, \u201cseemingly irrelevant topics\u201d, \u201cwhether adopting the minority\u201d, \u201caim to provide instruction to cases\u201d, \u201clinear regression\u201d (should be \u201clogistic regression\u201d since it\u2019s a classifier), and so on. In summary, I think the paper has an interesting approach to an important problem, but with results that are only marginally convincing. I would have liked to see a more thorough empirical investigation to clearly establish the value of the proposed method. Based on these observations, I think the paper misses the mark and is slightly below the acceptance threshold for me.", "rating": "6: Weak Accept", "reply_text": "Thank you very much for the useful feedback .

Instead of using majority vote to ensemble the decisions of several classifiers, this paper follows the \"surprisingly popular\" algorithm; the ensembled decision is the decision whose posterior probability (based on several classifiers) most exceeds a prior probability (given by classifier(s) trained to predict the posterior predictions). It's quite a nice idea to bring this finding from human decision-making to machine learning. If it worked in machine learning, it would be quite surprising, as the surprisingly popular algorithm risks that the ensemble makes a decision against the majority vote, which is usually consider the safe/default option for ensembling. Overall, I did not find the experiments (in the current state) to provide compelling enough support for the claim that MTS is a useful approach to ensembling in machine learning. * Unless I am mistaken, the authors use a more powerful model (an MLP) as the regressor compared to some of the models they ensemble over. In practice, people ensemble the most powerful models they have available, so it's unclear if using a regressor with the same capacity as the ensembled classifiers will provide any additional benefit. On a related note, it would be nice to know what is the classification performance of each individual classifier? As well as how often the regressor correctly choose to go with several weaker models rather than the strongest model. In particular, I am concerned that the performance of the ensemble might be less than or equal to the performance of a single MLP classifier (or whatever other model does best). * \"In this paper, each of the datasets we used has a small size - we chose to focus on the small data regime where the classifiers are likely to make mistakes.\" Why not try large data tasks that are challenging for state-of-the-art models? The paper makes a general claim that MTS is a good way to aggregate predictions, so only evaluating on small datasets seems to be a limitation * As I understand (correct me if I am wrong), the reported results are only on examples with \"high disagreement\" between classifiers. However, for practical use cases, it is useful to know how the overall accuracy compares. One major risk of using the \"surprisingly popular\" algorithm is that the algorithm may cause the ensemble to make many incorrect predictions when the majority is right (but the minority prediction is selected). If you have those numbers, I would be interested to see them added to the paper. I am also unsure about if applying the \"surprisingly popular\" algorithm in machine learning makes sense. The algorithm is motivated by the fact that difference agents have different information. However, in the ML setting, various classifiers usually have the same information. It's possible to restrict the information given to each classifier, but that would limit the performance of each individual classifier (and hurt the ensemble). I would be curious if the authors have any thoughts on this point. I also have a few questions/concerns about how the approach is implemented: * Why not train a single model to predict the average prediction of all models and use that model's prediction as the prior? This approach seems simpler but equivalent to the approach currently taken. * Why not use model distillation (predicting all output logits/probabilities, or an average thereof) rather than just predicting an average of 0/1 predictions? * For HMTS, why do the regressors for each of L labels need to be separate? It seems more efficient to use a multi-class model (as many model distillation approaches do) * If DMTS can learn to predict when most classifiers are wrong, why wouldn't the original classifiers themselves learn to predict the answer correctly? It seems to me that the reason the experiments show that DMTS/HMTS work is that some/many of the underlying classifiers are weaker than the model that is used to ensemble the predictions (an assumption that doesn't hold in practice).

I also have a few questions/concerns about how the approach is implemented: * Why not train a single model to predict the average prediction of all models and use that model's prediction as the prior? This approach seems simpler but equivalent to the approach currently taken. * Why not use model distillation (predicting all output logits/probabilities, or an average thereof) rather than just predicting an average of 0/1 predictions? * For HMTS, why do the regressors for each of L labels need to be separate? It seems more efficient to use a multi-class model (as many model distillation approaches do) * If DMTS can learn to predict when most classifiers are wrong, why wouldn't the original classifiers themselves learn to predict the answer correctly? It seems to me that the reason the experiments show that DMTS/HMTS work is that some/many of the underlying classifiers are weaker than the model that is used to ensemble the predictions (an assumption that doesn't hold in practice). Overall, I really like the high-level idea, and a better ensembling approach promises to bring empirical gains across many ML tasks. However, I have several concerns about the experiments, motivation, and algorithmic decisions which make me hesitant to recommend the paper for acceptance.", "rating": "3: Weak Reject", "reply_text": "Thank you very much for the valuable feedback . Question 1 ( \u201c Unless I am mistaken , the authors use a more powerful\u2026 ... \u201d ) : HMTS only uses MLP regressors to predict the information `` '' how many other classifiers would agree with themselves '' . We use linear regressors in HMTS instead of MLPs and obtain almost the same performance . As mentioned in Section 4.2 in the paper , we tried MLP and other methods such as logistic regression in DMTS and the performance are almost the same . So using MLP regressors in HMTS or classifier in DMTS do n't provide additional benefits . Other experimental results will be provided in the revision . Question 2 ( \u201c In this paper , each of the datasets we used has a small size ... \u2026 \u201d ) : Our paper tried 12 datasets and list their performance . Some of them are small datasets in which the training and testing datasets have only several hundreds of data points . But some of them , especially for multiclass datasets , are not small and have > 10,000 data points . Our proposed methods have improvements in both large and small size of dataset . As suggested by our experimental results , the improved performance in small size of dataset is larger . Question 3 ( \u201c As I understand ( correct me if I am wrong ) , the reported ... \u2026 \u201d ) : Because the majority voting rule , or other ensemble methods , are more likely to be wrong in the `` high disagreement '' situation , e.g. , 8 classifiers say 1 and 7 say 0 , this is a high disagreement setting . We will do the experiments in all cases as you suggested and the experimental results will be provided in the revision version . Question 4 ( \u201c I am also unsure about if applying the `` surprisingly popular '' algorithm in machine learning makes sense .... \u2026 \u201d ) : We agree , if all classifiers share the same information , the idea of BTS won \u2019 t work . In practice , we will need to diversify the baseline classifiers . In our experiments , this is exactly why we add small but different amounts of noise to the training data to train different classifiers . Question 5 ( \u201c I also have a few questions/concerns about how the approach is implemented .... \u2026 \u201d ) : 5.1 ( \u201c Why not train a single model to predict the average prediction of all models .... \u2026 \u201d ) : Because we want to make the same setting as the seed paper . We consider each classifier as an independent agent which should have its independent model to predict its own `` '' how many other classifiers would agree with themselves '' . 5.2 ( \u201c Why not use model distillation ( predicting all output logits/probabilities .... \u2026 \u201d ) : Our proposed approaches have the probabilities firstly and then output 1 or 0 based on the comparison of probabilities . 5.3 ( \u201c For HMTS , why do the regressors for each of L labels need to be separate .... \u2026 \u201d ) : Because we considered each classifier as an independent agent . 5.4 ( \u201c If DMTS can learn to predict when most classifiers are wrong .... \u2026 \u201d ) : For different basic classifiers , there are always different types of misclassification points even though for the same type and same-level performance of strong classification models with different parameters such as deep learning methods . We want to propose approaches which can also detect whether the minority answer is correct or not in the situation mentioned above . In HMTS and DMTS , we used other methods which are similar to the basic classifiers to replace MLP models and obtained almost the same performance . So MLP models do n't provide additional benefit ."}}
