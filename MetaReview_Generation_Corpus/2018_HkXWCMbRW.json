Pros: - Clear presentation, easy to follow. - Very interesting, but obvious, question is explored. - The paper is very clear, and uses building blocks which have been analyzed before, which leaves the authors free to explore their interactions rather than each individual building block's property. - Results are shown on two tasks (classification / segmentation) rather than just one (the obvious one would have been to only discuss results on classification), and relatively intuitive results are shown (i.e., more bits = better performance).

As for your comments , we have addressed them as follows : 1 ) The reason for not exploring more encoders is twofold . First , few of the state-of-the-art compression variants of neural networks are open-source which makes the implementation of different architectures very time consuming and difficult . We picked this particular encoder since it has been used in at least 2 different works , Theis et al.and Agustsson et al.Second , the autoencoder compression methods also all have a similar structure and thus one could expect the performance to be similar for different encoders . This is nevertheless an interesting direction of research worth pursuing . 2 ) These were done channel-wise ( RGB ) . 3 ) We have not yet had time to do this as the code for segmentation , classification and compression networks have different levels of optimization ( e.g. , NCHW vs NHWC tensor layout ) , so doing a fair comparison is time consuming and involves careful engineering . We however can do this before camera ready , if the paper is accepted . We also note that the architectures used for compression and inference are very similar , convolutional networks with residual blocks , and therefore FLOPs should be a good proxy metric . 4 ) This has been fixed in the revised edition of the paper 5 ) We agree that it would be interesting to learn the downscaling as well , after all it is just an anti-aliasing kernel ( i.e.a convolution with a fixed kernel ) followed by a subsampling operation and can be learned as well . However , processing the images in full-resolution during training would quite significantly increase training times , which are already pushing our limits in terms of compute resources . Another challenge is that hyperparameters of the ResNet architecture would likely need to be re-tuned . We chose to adhere to the standard setting of the classification literature , so that we could use the hyperparameter settings and training schedules which have already been optimized extensively ."}, {"review_id": "HkXWCMbRW-2", "review_text": "This is a well-written and quite clear work about how a previous work on image compression using deep neural networks can be extended to train representations which are also valid for semantic understanding.

C2 We gave an indexing system as an example application , but the main goal of the paper is to study the interplay between learned compression and inference in general . As mentioned in the paper , classical compression can be much faster than learned one - and our computational gains are relative to a system using learned compression . While falling back to classical codecs would be cheaper in terms of compute ( since classical encoder+decoder is more efficient than the learned encoder ) , the story is not so simple , since this would come at the expense of transmitting more data for a given target image quality . This can be crucial , since for mobile devices , data transmission ( I/O ) is responsible for most energy usage in common applications ( Pathak et.al , 2012 ) . Since learned compression is still at its infancy , we expect the gap in terms of compression performance between learned methods and classical ones to grow . Furthermore , with the increasing availability of dedicated neural network processing units on devices , deep image compression methods could become as fast as traditional ones . C3 We have condensed the paper to remove redundant text and also moved some non-core results to the appendix . Q1.Yes , the standard learning rate schedule for training the ResNet classification architectures is a constant learning rate divided by factor 10 at fixed points in the training ( every 8 epochs for our setting ) . At the point when the learning rate is lowered the validation accuracy increases rapidly , and our validation curves show these jumps clearly . The jumps/difference between operating points is due to more detail being present in images at higher bitrate ( higher bpp ) and therefore doing inference on them is easier . Q2.Yes we also did experiments for joint training with segmentation that are detailed in the revised version of the paper . In short , we do not train jointly on the segmentation task but we take the jointly trained classification network ( that improves classification ) and use that as a starting point for segmentation , showing significant improvement for segmentation . These results are shown in Figure 7 . Q3.We have made the style of the plots consistent , connecting the dots for both . Q4.Figure 10 ( also Figure 10 in the revised edition ) shows how the compression metrics change when training jointly compared to training only the compression network . It can be seen that training jointly improves the perceptual metrics MS-SSIM and SSIM slightly while PSNR gets slightly worse ( higher is better for all metrics ) .
