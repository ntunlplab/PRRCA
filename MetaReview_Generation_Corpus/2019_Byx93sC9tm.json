They noted that the empirical observation of mode collapse in active learning was an interesting insight.  However, all the reviewers had concerns with novelty, particularly in light of Lakshminarayanan et al. who also train ensembles to get a measure of uncertainty.  An interesting addition to the paper might be some theoretical insight about what the model corresponds to when one ensembles multiple models from MC Dropout.  One reviewer noted that it's not clear that the ensemble is capturing the desired posterior.\n\nAs a note, I don't believe there is agreement in the community that MC dropout is state-of-the-art in terms of capturing uncertainty for deep neural networks, as argued in the author response (and the abstract).  To the contrary, I believe a variety of papers have improved over the results from that work (e.g. see experiments in Multiplicative Normalizing Flows from over a year ago).", "reviews": [{"review_id": "Byx93sC9tm-0", "review_text": "The authors propose to use the combination of model ensemble and MC dropout in Bayesian deep active learning.

It is interesting to empirically show that the mode collapse problem of MC-Dropout is important in active learning. The major concern I have is that the ensemble of MC-Dropout models is not an approximation of the posterior anymore. Each MC-Dropout model is an approximation of the posterior, but the ensemble of them may not. Therefore, it is a little misleading to still call it Bayesian active learning. Also, the ensemble of MC-Dropout models does not have the theoretic support from the Bayesian perspective. The motivation for the proposed method is to solve the mode collapse problem of MC-Dropout, but using ensemble loses the Bayesian support benefit of MC-Dropout. So it seems not a reasonable solution for the mode collapse problem of MC-Dropout. It is not clear to me why we need to add MC-Dropout to the ensemble.

This leads to over-confident predictions which is problematic particularly in an active learning scenario. To prevent this behavior, the paper proposes to combine multiple Bayesian neural networks, independently trained with Dropout MC, to an ensemble. The proposed method achieves better uncertainty estimates than a single Bayesian neural networks model and improves upon the baseline in an active learning setting for image classification. The paper addresses active deep learning which is certainly an interesting research direction since in practice, labeled data is notoriously scarce. However, the paper contains only little novelty and does not provide sufficiently new scientific insights. It is well known from the literature that combining multiply neural networks to an ensemble leads to better performance and uncertainty estimates. For instance, Lakshminarayanan et al.[1] showed that Dropout MC can produce overconfident wrong prediction and, by simply averaging prediction over multiple models, one achieves better performance and confidence scores. Also, Huand et al. [2] showed that by taking different snapshots of the same network at different timesteps performance improves. It would also be great if the paper could related to other existing work that uses Bayesian neural networks in an active learning setting such as Bayesian optimization [3, 4] or Bandits[5]. Another weakness of the paper is that the empirical evaluation is not sufficiently rigorous: 1) Besides an comparison to the work by Lakshminarayanan et. al, I would also like to have seen a comparison to other existing Bayesian neural network approaches such as stochastic gradient Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo methods. 2) To provide a better understanding of the paper, it would also be interesting to see how sensitive it is with respect to the ensemble size M. 3) Furthermore, for the experiments only one neural network architecture was considered and it remains an open question, how the presented results translate to other architectures. The same holds for the type of data, since the paper only shows results for image classification benchmarks. 4) Figure 3: Are the results averaged over multiple independent runs?
