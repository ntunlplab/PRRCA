The method is theoretically derived then applied on two problems, one simple but with many (1000) agents, and one with only 2 agents but partial observability.\n\nThe main strength of this paper lies in the scalability and the time complexity of the proposed method. Computing Nash equilibriums for many agents is a difficult problem and this paper is interesting in this aspect.\n\nHowever, the reviewers point out several weak points to this paper. The difference with a previous work by Han, Hu and Long needs to be highlighted. Some parts of the paper are not clear, and too much of the important results are pushed into the appendix. Maybe this work is not best fitted to a conference format, and should be submitted to a journal? Another concern raised by the reviewers is that the experimental section does not show significant enough results, and that it is surprising to see a 2-agents problem as an illustration of a method that is aiming at addressing scalability with respect to the number of agents.\n\nReviewers agree on rejection for this paper, although by a small margin. I therefore recommend rejection. I think that if the authors improve this paper by following the reviewer suggestions, it can be accepted in a future venue.", "reviews": [{"review_id": "UoAFJMzCNM-0", "review_text": "Summary The paper introduces improved deep learning architecture for solving stochastic differential games by fictitious play . Compared to previous best model it uses LSTM instead of MLP to capture forward dynamics of the system , importance sampling and order invariant encoding of other agents to improve sample efficiency of learning . Strong points * Order invariant encoding uses inherent structure of the problem that improves sample efficiency compared to previous approaches . * Batching of some operations speeds up the algorithm . * Two different domains are used to evaluate the model . Weak points * Time complexity claims are problematic . * The paper is sometimes difficult to follow . It seems like 8 pages are n't enough to describe the whole approach in detail . Many things in appendix seem central for the presented system . * Importance sampling that is claimed to be important ingredient is n't described well enough neither in the main text nor in the appendix . * Quantitative evaluation is presented only for domains that can be already solved analytically . In other domains only qualitative results are presented . Recommendation I recommend rejecting the paper due to lack of clarity and lack of evaluation against other methods suitable for solving problems that ca n't be solved analytically . Questions * It seems to me that `` propagate by batch '' time complexities in Table 1 assume constant time computation of batches . Is that correct ? That would however be a simplification , while batched computation is much faster on GPUs it is n't in general constant time . This view is further supported by Fig 4 where empirical time complexity also is n't constant as is suggested by Table 1 . * My understanding of empirical results is that the model is run in domains with analytical solution only as sanity check . The true value is in domains without analytical solution ( e.g.Superlinear Simulation section ) . Current evaluation for superlinear setup and autonomous racing is only qualitative . I would like to see comparison to previous methods applicable to these domains if there are any ( numerical solvers ? ) . If there are n't any the paper should explain why this is the case . I understand that the model is an improvement over Han & Hu however does it allow us to do something we could n't do before when we consider even non learning methods ? Please reflect on this point to help me better understand main contribution of the paper . This broader context would help readers ( like me ) that are n't experts in stochastic differential games . Possible improvements * Since most of the results compare presented model against Han & Hu 2019 it would help to add a paragraph that briefly summarizes algorithmic/model differences . Is it true that current system is Han & Hu with LSTM instead of MLP + importance sampling + invariant layer ? * In table 2 unit of `` Total time '' is n't specified . * `` memory complexity of LSTM with respect to time is O ( 1 ) '' this is true for inference time , at train time O ( T ) activations still have to be stored . ( If they are n't to be recomputed again for each t < T ) . The text can be more clear on that . * In Figs 5 and 6 captions say that it compares current system against Han & Hu however the legend shows FC and LSTM with and without invariant layers . I assume that Han & Hu = FC and current system is LSTM + invariant layer . However being more explicit about that would help . Does FC model here use importance sampling or not ?

The time complexity of a parallel system is sophisticated to analyze because we need certain configurations of hardware such as computation efficiency , thread synchronization time , etc . We decided to remove table 2 and only show the time and memory complexity empirically in the updated Figure 4 . * * 2.Clarification for importance sampling * * Reviewer4 raised questions about the importance sampling as well , and let me elaborate here for clarification . The main difference between our FBSDE representation and prior work ( Han & Hu and the follow-up proof of convergence paper by Han , Hu & Long ) is the importance sampling scheme , where the forward process of an agent is propagated using a controlled SDE where the controls are computed from explicit solutions of the Hamiltonian minimization . In Han & Hu , the forward process is an uncontrolled process . The use of importance sampling allows for more efficient sampling and hence faster convergence of the algorithm . Since the FC architecture comes from Han & Hu , the FC experiments do not have importance sampling implemented . We also experimented with integrating important sampling in their FC model , but it performed worse . A possible reason is listed in section 3.2 of the paper . * * 3.Add comparison with baseline besides qualitative results * * We added a comparison against the baseline ( from Han & Hu ) for superlinear dynamics using the total cost , which is defined by the original objective function in eq.2.Please refer to Figure 12 in the revised version of the paper for the comparison . * * 4.A possible application for numerical solver * * Numerical PDE solvers based on finite element and finite difference methods do not scale beyond very few dimensions , as they rely on grids . * * 5.Addressed the unclear legend in the figure ( 5,6,7 ) * * We updated figure 5,6,7 with a more clear legend to demonstrate the architectures we used for experiments . * * 6.Contributions of this work * * The main advantage of the framework introduced is its scalability wrt . time and memory . The use of importance sampling and LSTM architecture accelerate training by improving the sample efficiency and introducing time correlation in the network architecture . The addition of an invariant layer renders our framework invariant to permutations of agents . This also greatly reduces the memory complexity of our framework and improves the performance when the number of agents is large . Our framework scales to 20x the problem in Han & Hu and achieves better performance on a similar scale ."}, {"review_id": "UoAFJMzCNM-1", "review_text": "Clarity : Till page 3 the paper was easy to follow , i.e. , the analytical expressions in eq ( 5 ) , and the basic idea of Algorithm 1 ( which is same as prior works by Han et al. , Wang et al. , Periera et al . ) are clear . However , after page 3 the paper is hard to follow . The specific points are as follows : 1 ) It looks like both LSTM and FC have been tried in the past . So what is the novelty here ? Is it making the deep FBSDE framework scalable ? and if so how is this achieved ? by introducing the invariant layer ? or just using the symmetry property to share the networks ? 2 ) Comparisons with Han & Hu ( 2019 ) is presented only in Table 2 . Figure 5 says comparison with Han & Hu ( 2019 ) , but only FC w/wo invariant layer and LSTM w/wo invariant layer have been presented . Is it true that Han & Hu ( 2019 ) is FC and LSTM without the invariant layer and the current approach in the paper is FC and LSTM with the invariant layer ? 3 ) Figure 2 , says comparison between analytical and deep FBDSDE solutions . Yet , 10 trajectories are displayed . Do they correspond to 10 different agents ? If so , what is the difference between the 10 trajectories and the deep FBSDE solution ? 4 ) In the autonomous racing section , the authors mention `` The results emphasizes the generalization ability of our framework '' what is generalization here ? Is it that the method also works on a different domain ? Quality : 1 ) The main contribution seems to be scalability . It will be a lot helpful if Section 3.2 is elaborated a bit more , where the ` scalability ' aspects of the current work is discussed in detail . As of now , Section 3.2 seems ` rushed ' . 2 ) Table 2 compares the proposed method with Han & Hu ( 2019 ) . This is done for 10 agents . Yet , we do not know what happens as we increase the number of agents . 3 ) Figure 4 has number of agents in x-axis , yet it compares only the various implementations of the current work and prior work is not included . Novelty : It appears that the paper puts together blocks/algorithms in prior works ( say invariant layer from Zaheer et al.2017 , deep FBSDE from Wang et al. , Periera et al. , Han & Hu ) . This way novelty seems to be limited . Significance : Scalability is the main take away of this paper . Figure 5 and Figure 4 show that the proposed method is better than prior methods , yet the performance improvement is not significant . However , the savings could be in the time/space complexity , which the paper does not elaborate . In short , due to the fact that certain critical parts have not been explained it is hard to judge the significance . Overall Feedback : The critical information regarding the invariant layers , scaling , savings in the scaling is missing . Also , adding this information may not take significantly extra space .
