The approach is similar to methods that use multi-stream networks (a stream for each domain), but using the filer decomposition scheme, the authors avoid the issue of excessive increase in the number of parameters typical in fully multi-stream architectures. This is achieved by learning a separate basis for convolutional filters for each domain while sharing the basis coefficients across domains. This encourages shared semantics across domains while maintaining a balance between the network expressiveness and the computational complexity. The authors argue that the basis learned for each domain can be understood as correction/alignment mappings to bring together the representations of each domain. A toy example presented is convincing and shows the correction basis learned in a simple synthetic case. Theoretical arguments are provided to show that the proposed correction scheme covers a large range of possible domain shifts.

The main advantage of the proposed approach is that by only introducing a few model parameters, the proposed approach could quickly adapt to new domains. Similar idea has been proposed in [1], where the authors propose to use domain-specific encoders to extract domain-invariant features. Compared with [1], the main novelty of this paper lies in a new feature decomposition of the traditional convolution layer. My main concern is that this paper seems to miss a significant line of recent work on learning domain-invariant representations [2-3]. Basically, it has been shown that invariant representations provably hurt generalization on the target domain when the marginal label distributions are different between the source and target domains. Note that such result also holds when different feature extractors are used in source and target domains, so the model proposed in this manuscript is also subject to such inherent tradeoffs. [1].

Instead of another invariant-learning method , the main message of our paper is to show that one extremely simple and computationally/memory efficient way to add invariant-learning to existing state-of-the-art CNN models is to represent each convolutional \ufb01lter as a linear combination of a small set of basis elements . This is innovative in the sense that is not about a new architecture designed to outperform others for a given task and a given dataset , but about providing a plug-and-play framework , here exemplified with numerous architectures and examples and further supported by theory . In this way , each convolution layer is decomposed into two convolution layers , a basis layer followed by a coefficient layer . Since we have only spatial-wise convolution at a basis layer , and only channel-wise convolution at a coefficient layer , we now obtain a unique opportunity to \u201c absorb \u201d domain spatial variations if we make each basis layer domain-specific , but channel mixing coefficients shared across domains . All these are not feasible with traditional convolution layers without the proposed framework , where convolutions are performed simultaneously across space and channels . As demonstrated in Tables 2,3,4 , by simply plugging the proposed domain \ufb01lter decomposition into existing state-of-the-art CNN architectures , we always observe performance improvements in diverse tasks . This is thereby a framework and not a particular new architecture tailored to a task/dataset . * Tradeoff concern in [ 2,3 ] . We find [ 2,3 ] do not conflict with our contributions , as detailed next . We believe neither the authors nor their empirical findings/theoretic arguments in [ 2 ] at all infer that efforts in invariant representation learning are futile ; that is clearly not the spirit of the very important messages and contributions in [ 2 ] . For example , in our street-view image segmentation example , we perform unsupervised adaptation from video games images to real-world street-view images , which is obviously of extremely high practical value . Furthermore , the proposed framework allows to work with multiple domains simultaneously as illustrated in our paper . Both Table 4 and Figure A.2 , for example , clearly indicate the success of the proposed invariant representation learning on providing invariant features . Such empirical success is further explained in the paper through a rigorous theoretical analysis of the provable invariance with domain-specific bases , under a large range of possible domain shifts ( as common in the field , the theory lags behind the practical success , explaining only parts of it for the moment ) . We agree with [ 2 ] that there are situations in unsupervised DA where learning invariant representation and minimizing source domain loss may not guarantee generalization in the target domain . But such finding can not deny the value of domain invariant feature learning , which is the focus of this paper , to domain adaptation tasks . On the contrary , as shown by the [ 4 ] and many other theoretical results , under proper settings , the learning of invariant features are the key for domain adaptation and learning of causal factors . [ 3 ] shares similar arguments with [ 2 ] , and further proposes alignment methods that alleviate the negative effects introduced by different marginal label distributions . As demonstrated with extensive experiments , the proposed domain-adaptive filter decomposition can be plug-and-played in diverse architectures and diverse settings , both supervised and unsupervised , to improve over current baselines . With the improved training losses for unsupervised DA in [ 3 ] , we can expect even further performance improvement by plugging our filter decomposition . We will validate our hypothesis by the time of the conference by attempting to reimplement losses in [ 3 ] . In summary , we propose domain-adaptive filter decomposition as a plug-and-play method for various invariant feature learning tasks , including but not limited to unsupervised domain adaptation . And the theoretical result in our paper proves the alignment of deep representations at the level of individual image sample , without assuming any distribution of samples conditioned on classes .
