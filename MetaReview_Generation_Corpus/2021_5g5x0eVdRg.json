For the first issue , I disagree with the authors and agree with the other reviewers : This is an important claim that needs to be justified and I disagree with the authors 's comment on the current results of the paper being a sufficient empirical evidence for the claim .

IIC is an end-to-end deep clustering methodology that directly provides the cluster label of an input image . Training is based on maximizing Mutual Information ( MI ) between pairs of related images ( typically generated through augmentations ) . In this work the authors argue that IIC performs suboptimal maximization of MI , thus the obtained solutions focus mainly on low-level representations and do not distill higher level semantic similarity of images . To solve this problem , they propose an IIC extension ( called DHOG ) where multipe clustering solutions are obtained through MI maximization , under the constraint that the solutions found are sufficiently different ( ie.minimum MI between the clustering solutions is seeked ) . The proposed objective function is novel , however it involves a regularization constant \\alpha to be set by the user . The idea of stopping gradients to impose a hierarchy of solutions is interesting . The experimental results indicate improved clustering performance . Comments to be addressed : 1 ) Application of the method requires the specification of the number of K heads . It in this work K=8 is set . What is the reasoning for such selection and how does the value of K affect the results ? 2 ) DHOG is computatonally more complex compared to IIC . What is the execution time of DHOG compared to IIC ? 3 ) What happens for values of \\alpha greater that 0.05 ? How sensitive is the method on the value of \\alpha ? 4 ) It is strongly suggested to include a visual example illustrating the difference among the obtained clustering solutions ( e.g.on CIFAR-10 ) to provide visual evidence that improved clustering solutions are progressively found . 5 ) It is not clear whether IIC results are obtained using Sobel preprocssing or not . What if Sobel preprocessing is used in DHOG ? 6 ) The presentation of the paper could be improved , by first briefly describing the IIC approach and then presenting the proposed extension ( DHOG ) .", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "( 1 ) K was set using a small number of cross-validation runs ( similar to how we set alpha ) . The reasoning is simply a question of balancing the driving motivation of this research ( diverse representation learning ) and the compute capacity we had at our disposal . Since adding heads incurs memory and compute costs , adding more heads ( after 8 ) yielded diminishing returns - the solutions became more similar to earlier solutions in the hierarchy . Because of this , the results were not affected when K > 8 : we simply used the highest number of heads that we could . ( 2 ) The backbone network of DHOG is a ResNet18 . The backbone of IIC is a ResNet34 . While the additional heads mean that the parameter counts are similar between IIC and DHOG , we can discard K-1 heads after learning - only the single head that best optimises the training objective is needed for inference . The execution times should be very similar , although we have not tested this directly . ( 3 ) We explored alpha after setting it using cross-validation on Cifar-10 since it was not sensitive within an order of magnitude . As long as the DHOG method contributed to learning representations ( alpha > 0 , within reason ) , the results were largely similar . ( 4 ) We agree that this is indeed informative . We originally prepared this and wanted to include it in the main paper but were thwarted by space constraints . We have now added it as an appendix , and apoligise for its original omission . ( 5 ) None of the results presented in our work used Sobel preprocessing . Our argument for not using Sobel is that it is destructive and can easily remove useful information ( such as colour ) , even though the gains it offers are clear for other methods . Further , edge detection is only meaningful for natural images or related - in other settings ( e.g.some medical imaging settings ) edge detection is not a sensible preprocessor . The nature of this work is such that we do not want to cloud the gains owing to DHOG with heuristic , symptomatic treatment of the underlying issue . We do outline this in Section 1.1 under `` Dealing with greedy solutions '' . ( 6 ) We expect that we have mistakenly given the impression that our work can be contextualised primarily as an extension to IIC , and we understand why . However , the fundamental idea behind creating diverse representations can be applied to any MI-based unsupervised learning method . As other reviewers have pointed out , there are some modern methods that outperform IIC and DHOG ( and we have included these in the paper now , while also making clear the context of our work ) . Our focus , however , is to show the efficacy of learning diverse representations , and not necessarily beating state of the art . We are planning to apply DHOG to these methods , but we would also like to make clear that our main goal is to introduce a method that learns diverse representations , and in so doing helps to better optimise the MI objective . This is a key problem of neural networks for unsupervised representation learning , and DHOG is an approach to enable better representation learning . Built on a superior backbone ( like SCAN , for example ) , we might hope that DHOG will nonetheless improve results on many of the methods that are now being proposed . In our opinion the long term benefits or otherwise will be easier to assess through the publication of this approach and the discussion and analysis that will come from that ."}, {"review_id": "5g5x0eVdRg-2", "review_text": "< Summary > This paper addresses the problem of unsupervised learning of class representation using data augmentation .

Conceptually , they could be reasonable solutions to the issue , but there is no theoretic and empirical evidence that supports this argument . ( 3 ) The other contribution that this work claims is strong performance of unsupervised clustering on benchmark datasets . However , the empirical comparison is only carried out with baselines in Ji et al. , 2019 .

Hence we focus on ( a ) empirical evidence and ( b ) give evidence for a description of what is going on . Our goal is to show that many current methods do not pay heed to the tendency of neural networks to end up in poor local optima , particularly for unsupervised MI-based learning . We demonstrate they do not sufficiently optimise the MI objective by providing an alternative that finds a much better optimum for the training objective - it is not just that it generalises better . In order to demonstrate the suboptimality of an optimizer , it is sufficient to show that there is another optimizer that performs better . We do that and demonstrate it using NMI in Table 1 . Though we show that other approaches do suffer from this issue , we do not claim that our approach perfectly fixes this - rather we just demonstrate empirically that it handles the problem significantly better . ( 2 ) As you say , we propose a particular approach that was designed precisely to mitigate the particular issue that we identified with current methods . Though we prove no theorems about this ( that is not the target of the paper ) , we do demonstrate the difference in the form of representations when we do or do not use a DHOG approach . The results in Table 1 provide clear empirical evidence supports an improvement in representation ( both in terms of MI and in terms of downstream tasks ) . The ablations show that DHOG is critical to this issue . We would be very happy to provide specific metrics the reviewer thinks would be useful beyond those already supplied . Even if the reviewer disagrees that our argument is the reason for the improved performance , we think the identification of poor-overly simple representations being learnt by many current MI optimizers is an important topic for onward discussion at the conference , and that this paper is an important contribution to that discussion . ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) Thank you for your comments and your pointers . We agree that there are recent papers that we should now adapt the method for and compare with . The approach of enforcing independence of a hierarchy of heads is complementary to any other choice of method : it is an operator to apply to other methods , not a single choice of architecture . At the time of creating DHOG , and consequently writing this paper , the state-of-the-art neural network clustering method was IIC ( Ji et al. , 2019 ) . Sadly SCAN or MPCC were not available and accessible when we were working on this . However we accept the need to keep up with the recent changes , and we have adapted the paper to fully acknowledge these papers and to give comparisons . We do emphasise though , that the primary objective of this paper is not to chase state of the art . What we are showing with this work is that by developing methods that specifically target learning a diverse set of representations we can better optimise a MI objective . We applied this to IIC at the time , and that is the context within which we present this work , and we look forward to assessing its continued application of DHOG to the very recent methods as part of our future work . Almost separate from this particular paper , we also think that it is important that we all , as proponents in a fast-moving field , recognise that researchers ' efforts , findings , and insights should not be nullified in the context that others , working in parallel , also had different good ideas which happened to do as well or better on benchmarks ( though benchmarks are important ) . In our opinion that would be a sad state of affairs for this research community and have a narrowing effect on the field which we feel would hinder it in the future . In light of the helpful comments , observations and requests for clarification , we have modified the claims of the paper and made the above-mentioned context clear . We have also included additional comparisons .

Authors support their method with an experimental study . The proposed method has some merits like finding a representation that has higher mutual information compared to baselines . I have several concerns about the paper : a ) Authors state that some greedy optimization may end up lower MI optima . Since deep neural networks are not convex , is this a surprising point or is this expected one ? b ) I think empirical comparison needs significant improvement . Authors mention the proposed method was outperforming the state of the art \u201c at the time of writing \u201d . However , currently I believe this is not the case . For example , GATCluster achieves 28.1 % on Cifar100-20 . c ) I see the proposed method as shown in Fig 1 , is novel . As far as I understand it is adding some extra blocks to already existing method and calculates mutual information between heads . I would like to point out that hierarchical ordering is an interesting idea however the impact of hierarchical ordering is not very clear . Why does architecture need extra heads i.e.h_4 to h_8 . Would you please emphasize the novelty of the idea bit more ? Although I have some concerns about the paper , I would like to be extremely clear that I am open to change my view if more explanation and/or evidence supplied .", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "a ) You are absolutely right that it is expected that neural networks will end up in a local optima . However the quality of the local optima matters ( how suboptimal it is ) . We show that the local optima that standard neural networks with SGD find are substantially poorer local optima than an approach ( such as DHOG ) which counteracts the overly-simple solutions they produce . This is true for the actual target training objective , not just the generalisation capability , though that is impacted too . b ) We understand that there are now several methods that warrant comparison in this context . This approach was developed while IIC was the top-performing clustering method and structured our comparisons in that context . So strictly it was state-of-art at the time of writing , but you are right that we should temper that claim . Though time moves on quickly in this field , the approach of enforcing independence of a hierarchy of heads is complementary to any other choice of method : it is an operator to apply to other methods , not a single choice of architecture - the improvements over IIC indicate the benefit to be obtained in one setting . In addition , the fundamental idea of diverse solutions being key to better MI objective optimisation ( see the point below ) stands as an important research finding , regardless of the underlying clustering method employed . We urge you to consider the context of our work , and that what we were trying to achieve is a method of learning diverse representations - chasing the state-of-the-art is not our primary driver and we hope that this does not obscure the utility of what we have achieved . We have modified the claim in the paper to make it clear there are now other methods available and tempered the claim that this was state-of-the art , and will provide these additional comparisons . Nonetheless , in the future we will adapt DHOG to the current bleeding edge of deep clustering methods to explore how diverse representation learning can improve these . c ) We mentioned toward the end of Section 3.1 that without the hierarchy the gains were reduced . A good way of understanding the hierarchy is to assume that the earliest head ( h_1 ) is free to learn any representation that satisfies the MI objective . Since the basis of our argument is that this is suboptimal ( and indeed it must be a simple-to-compute representation as it is early in the network ) , this head becomes a point of comparison to enable learning . That is , the next head ( h_2 ) must have low MI with h_1 . In so doing h_2 avoids the same suboptimal local optima that h_1 ends up in . We simply assume that there are a number of viable poorer local optima , and extend this line of reasoning with additional heads ( the number is largely arbitrary ) to help explore potentially better ones . The hierarchical approach to learn different representations pushes each head to be conditionally independent of all previous heads ( the gradient stopping ensures that later heads do n't influence earlier ones directly ) , and therefore diverse . The hierarchy was critical to this process and the results achieved . Learning diverse representations is a key problem in the use of neural networks for unsupervised representation learning ."}], "0": {"review_id": "5g5x0eVdRg-0", "review_text": "In this paper , the authors study the problem of unsupervised representation learning from data augmentations .

Even if the reviewer disagrees that our argument is the reason for the improved performance , we think the identification of poor-overly simple representations being learnt by many current MI optimizers is an important topic for onward discussion at the conference , and that this paper is an important contribution to that discussion . ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) Thank you for your comments and your pointers . We agree that there are recent papers that we should now adapt the method for and compare with . The approach of enforcing independence of a hierarchy of heads is complementary to any other choice of method : it is an operator to apply to other methods , not a single choice of architecture . At the time of creating DHOG , and consequently writing this paper , the state-of-the-art neural network clustering method was IIC ( Ji et al. , 2019 ) . Sadly SCAN or MPCC were not available and accessible when we were working on this . However we accept the need to keep up with the recent changes , and we have adapted the paper to fully acknowledge these papers and to give comparisons . We do emphasise though , that the primary objective of this paper is not to chase state of the art . What we are showing with this work is that by developing methods that specifically target learning a diverse set of representations we can better optimise a MI objective . We applied this to IIC at the time , and that is the context within which we present this work , and we look forward to assessing its continued application of DHOG to the very recent methods as part of our future work . Almost separate from this particular paper , we also think that it is important that we all , as proponents in a fast-moving field , recognise that researchers ' efforts , findings , and insights should not be nullified in the context that others , working in parallel , also had different good ideas which happened to do as well or better on benchmarks ( though benchmarks are important ) . In our opinion that would be a sad state of affairs for this research community and have a narrowing effect on the field which we feel would hinder it in the future . In light of the helpful comments , observations and requests for clarification , we have modified the claims of the paper and made the above-mentioned context clear . We have also included additional comparisons . We hope that alleviates your concerns and sheds an important perspective on the paper ."}, "3": {"review_id": "5g5x0eVdRg-3", "review_text": "Authors introduce a method which is tailored to unsupervised representation learning via minimizing mutual information . Authors support their method with an experimental study . The proposed method has some merits like finding a representation that has higher mutual information compared to baselines . I have several concerns about the paper : a ) Authors state that some greedy optimization may end up lower MI optima . Since deep neural networks are not convex , is this a surprising point or is this expected one ? b ) I think empirical comparison needs significant improvement . Authors mention the proposed method was outperforming the state of the art \u201c at the time of writing \u201d . However , currently I believe this is not the case . For example , GATCluster achieves 28.1 % on Cifar100-20 . c ) I see the proposed method as shown in Fig 1 , is novel . As far as I understand it is adding some extra blocks to already existing method and calculates mutual information between heads . I would like to point out that hierarchical ordering is an interesting idea however the impact of hierarchical ordering is not very clear . Why does architecture need extra heads i.e.h_4 to h_8 . Would you please emphasize the novelty of the idea bit more ? Although I have some concerns about the paper , I would like to be extremely clear that I am open to change my view if more explanation and/or evidence supplied .", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "a ) You are absolutely right that it is expected that neural networks will end up in a local optima . However the quality of the local optima matters ( how suboptimal it is ) . We show that the local optima that standard neural networks with SGD find are substantially poorer local optima than an approach ( such as DHOG ) which counteracts the overly-simple solutions they produce . This is true for the actual target training objective , not just the generalisation capability , though that is impacted too . b ) We understand that there are now several methods that warrant comparison in this context . This approach was developed while IIC was the top-performing clustering method and structured our comparisons in that context . So strictly it was state-of-art at the time of writing , but you are right that we should temper that claim . Though time moves on quickly in this field , the approach of enforcing independence of a hierarchy of heads is complementary to any other choice of method : it is an operator to apply to other methods , not a single choice of architecture - the improvements over IIC indicate the benefit to be obtained in one setting . In addition , the fundamental idea of diverse solutions being key to better MI objective optimisation ( see the point below ) stands as an important research finding , regardless of the underlying clustering method employed . We urge you to consider the context of our work , and that what we were trying to achieve is a method of learning diverse representations - chasing the state-of-the-art is not our primary driver and we hope that this does not obscure the utility of what we have achieved . We have modified the claim in the paper to make it clear there are now other methods available and tempered the claim that this was state-of-the art , and will provide these additional comparisons . Nonetheless , in the future we will adapt DHOG to the current bleeding edge of deep clustering methods to explore how diverse representation learning can improve these . c ) We mentioned toward the end of Section 3.1 that without the hierarchy the gains were reduced . A good way of understanding the hierarchy is to assume that the earliest head ( h_1 ) is free to learn any representation that satisfies the MI objective . Since the basis of our argument is that this is suboptimal ( and indeed it must be a simple-to-compute representation as it is early in the network ) , this head becomes a point of comparison to enable learning . That is , the next head ( h_2 ) must have low MI with h_1 . In so doing h_2 avoids the same suboptimal local optima that h_1 ends up in . We simply assume that there are a number of viable poorer local optima , and extend this line of reasoning with additional heads ( the number is largely arbitrary ) to help explore potentially better ones . The hierarchical approach to learn different representations pushes each head to be conditionally independent of all previous heads ( the gradient stopping ensures that later heads do n't influence earlier ones directly ) , and therefore diverse . The hierarchy was critical to this process and the results achieved . Learning diverse representations is a key problem in the use of neural networks for unsupervised representation learning ."}}
