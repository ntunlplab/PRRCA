Rather, it involves learning something (from the training set) that enables strong performance on a test set that differs from the training set in a way that is informed by ideas of compositionaity. \n\nAs far as I know, there are very few  studies that try to identify compositionality by considering the internal representations of neural networks, so it feels incorrect to claim this is standard practice. Any work that goes down this route ought to have a very thorough treatement of the various thorny philosophical and theoretical treatments of compositionality in the literature. As pointed out by R4, the work in its current form does not do this. \n\nIn summary, this work attempts to solve a problem that none of the four expert reviewers consider to be in need of a solution.

The proposed architecture consists of three components : a network that transforms the input X into a series of hidden representations { H_1 , H_2 , ... H_K } , a network that reconstructs the input X from this series of hidden representations , and a prediction network that generates a prediction from the hidden representations . The authors propose several datasets meant to address transferability of compositional generalisation , and show that their architecture significantly improves standard DNN architectures as well as humans on these datasets . * Motivation for score * Compositional generalization in neural networks is a relevant and hot topic , with still many open questions . This paper aims to contribute on this topic and proposes some interesting datasets . However , However , despite citing several papers addressing compositionality in neural networks in the related work section , I am not convinced that the authors have properly understood the questions that are asked in this domain and were able to address them properly . Below , I outline my concerns . 1.Definition of compositionality I do not find the definition of compositionality that the authors propose well motivated . - None of the three papers cited in the introduction to motivate the work actually has the word `` compositionality '' in the paper - The authors claim that previous work has focused just on whether models can extract compositional representations in the training distribution while ignoring the test distribution , while actually most recent papers they cite in related work test compositionality by considering very specific train/test splits - The author 's definition of compositional generalisation does not seem to take into account that compositionality is traditionally a property of mapping between input and output , not of a model itself . In addition to that , whether the mapping between input and output is compositional does not depend on what is in the train and what is in the test distribution . A model can understand the compositional structure of a dataset also if it has been trained on * all * examples of the dataset , only it will be impossible to behaviourally evaluate if it has . For this reason , much previous work on compositionality in neural networks has created datasets where the training and testing data were distributionally different ( as also the authors of this paper do ) . I would recommend the authors to have a look at the paper _Compositionality decomposed : how do neural networks generalise ? _ ( Hupkes et al . ; 2020 ) , for a detailed account of compositionality in the context of neural networks . In particular , their section on _localism_ is particularly important for the author 's definition of compositionality . 2.Architecture I find the proposed architecture interesting , but it is not completely clear to me how it differs from an auto-encoder setup where the encoding is larger than the input instead of smaller ( it is very well possible I misunderstood ) . Nevertheless , it can be interesting to see if auto-encoding based architectures behave better on datasets proposed to evaluate compositionality . One thing that is not clear to me is how the number of components _K_ is determined . 3.Data I appreciate the effort of the authors to design new datasets that test out-of-distribution generalisation . I do have a few comments/questions : - If the main motivation for wanting compositional generalisation is that this is an important capacity of humans , is n't it a problem that humans perform very poorly on the dataset ( much worse than the best deep neural network ) ? - What is the motivation for using a new dataset , rather than one of the previously proposed datasets for out-of-distribution generalisation ? - It is nice that the authors try to include tests from different domains , but I think that calling a dataset mapping inputs like `` januarymarch '' to ( 0 , 2 ) can not really be called `` natural language processing '' Overall , I do not believe that this paper should be accepted for the conference . _ * * Update after author response : * * I have read the author response , but do not find that the answers really address my concerns .

The said problem may arise when one trains neural models to produce \u201c compositional \u201d representations of the input . In the paper \u201c compositional representations \u201d consist of multiple vectors which are supposed to correspond to semantically meaningful aspects of the input , for example different objects in the case of images or different parts of compound words in the case of linguistic inputs . The transferability problem arises when there is a difference between training and test distributions , namely when certain combinations of objects have different probabilities in training & testing . The proposed solution at inference time is to project object representations to the manifold of individual object representations . The manifold is estimated by saving representations of individual object representations from the training time . The problem that the paper considers is an interesting one . There have been a lot of papers on learning object-oriented representations recently [ 1 , 2 ] , and an implicit assumption in all these works is that there is no statistical dependency between which objects that occur in the scenes .

Q5 : My main concerns are thus focused on the motivation of the proposed tasks themselves and the positioning with respect to their prior work . I think a great direction to improve the paper would be to add experiments without supervised learning and using 3D-rendered images with multiple objects as it is done e.g.in [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] . A5 : We will investigate it . Q6 : Algorithm 1 is very confusing because sample-level steps 1-4 are mixed with dataset-level steps 5 and 6 . A6 : Thank you for mentioning . We will clarify . Q7 : A confusing sentence in the intro : \u201c For a test sample , we regularize each hidden representation in its training manifold , and optimize them to recover the original input \u201d A7 : This sentence is the motivation of the approach , addressing the previous sentence \u201c each extracted representation shifts away from the corresponding one in training \u201d . Q8 : for colored digits experiments you might want to compare to and cite [ 3 ] A8 : Thank you , we will find more details ."}, "2": {"review_id": "GHCu1utcBvX-2", "review_text": "# # Summary This paper studies `` compositionality '' and in particular the way in which it `` transfers '' on test data .

Q1.The submission claims that other works that investigation compositionality in representation learning do not actually test compositional generalization ( `` because all combinations have positive joint probabilities in training '' ) . However , I disagree that this is the case in prior work . A1 : Existing methods tend to either measure compositionality but do not measure compositional generalization , or do not use compositional representation . We focus on the case to use compositional representation to achieve compositional generalization . Q2 : The algorithmic components in Section 4 are not adequately motivated , and the relationship of the algorithm to prior work in compositional representation learning is not discussed . A2 : The motivation of the algorithm is in the last two paragraphs of the Introduction section . Q3 : The evaluation tasks are extremely simple . A3 : The compositional generalization works with compositional representation are still in the stage of using simple examples to find the fundamental mechanisms .
