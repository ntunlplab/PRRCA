The contribution is an \"encoder-decoder\" architecture trained by variational inference, where the encoder produces the embedding of the nodes in the next graph of the sequence, and the decoder produces the structure of the next graph. \n\nOne important merit of the approach is  that this unsupervised representation can be used effectively for supervised learning, with results quite competitive to the state of the art. \n\nHowever the reviewers were unconvinced by the novelty and positioning of the approach. The point of whether the approach should be viewed as variational Bayesian, or simply variational approximation was much debated between the reviewers and the authors. \n\nThe area chair encourages the authors to pursue this very promising research, and to clarify the paper; perhaps the use of \"encoder-decoder\" generated too much misunderstanding. \nAnother graph NN paper you might be interested in is \"Edge Contraction Pooling for Graph NNs\", by Frederik Diehl. \n", "reviews": [{"review_id": "BkgGJlBFPS-0", "review_text": "Summary: This work proposes an unsupervised hierarchical graph representation learning method, named BayesPool.
