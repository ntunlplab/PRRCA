This work is another addition to the ever-growing literature on self-supervised learning (SSL) with emphasis on video and multi-modal data. The main contribution of this work is the manner in which it tackles a well-known drawback of contrastive learning, namely the strategy used to sample negatives in the contrastive pipeline. The authors propose an active sampling strategy that adaptively chooses negative samples that are informative and diverse. This active selection technique is similar in spirit to many selector functions proposed in the active learning literature. It seems to be the first time it is used for contrastive SSL. \n\nBased on all the reviews and the subsequent discussions, it seems that the reviewers' comments were addressed. The authors are commended on integrating the reviewers' suggestions and making the necessary edits to the paper in a timely manner.

To overcome the high redundancy in the negative samples , they propose an active negative sampling method . They use a gradient with respect to the pseudo label to measure the uncertainty of a negative sample . They use K-means clustering to maximize the negative sample diversity when constructing a new negative set for queueing . They show their method 's efficacy on the public benchmarks : Kinetics , AudioSet for retraining , and UCF-101 , HMDB-51 , ESC-50 for downstream tasks . # # # # Strengths * The problem is interesting and relevant to the community . Audio-visual self-supervised learning could be interesting for many researchers in the computer vision community . * Design choice looks reasonable and effective . Cross-modal contrastive learning gives a significant boost to performance . Active sampling gives a significant boost . * Writing is straightforward and easy to follow . # # # # Weaknesses However , I have a few concerns about this work . * To show the effectiveness of the proposed gradient-based active sampling method compared to the embedding-based active sampling , the authors plot the number of action categories vs. the number of training iterations in Figure 2 . However , in my opinion , more action categories might not mean high diversity in a negative set . For example , an action could be compositional . `` Drinking coffee '' action consists of `` picking up object '' , `` approach an object '' , `` bring an object to the actor '' . Since the proposed method uses 16 frames , very short , feature encoding , the embeddings will be more towards these subactions , not the entire actions . Therefore , more action categories do not directly mean more diverse negative examples . So I would suggest the authors directly compare the downstream task performance of gradient-based sampling and embedding-based sampling . * The comparison of the proposed method with the fully supervised method is unfair . The fully supervised method has VGG-M-2048 as a backbone and pretrained on ImageNet , while the proposed methods have 3D-ResNet-18 or R ( 2+1 ) D-18 as a backbone and pertained on Kinetics or AudioSet . It is also unclear which row of `` ours '' the authors compare to the fully supervised method . I can not find a 7.2p improvement on the UCF-101 and the 14.1p improvement on the HMDB-51 compared to the fully supervised method . It is okay that the proposed self-supervised method is weaker than the fully supervised method . However , the comparison should be fair , in my opinion . I will increase my rating if the authors adequately address my concerns . # # # # Minor comments : * 6 .

It builds on the Momentum Contrast ( MoCo ) paper ( 2020 ) , which aims for a moving average dictionary per modality along with cross-modal contrastive learning for self-supervised tasks , evaluated on audio-visual datasets . The paper takes this a step further by arguing for a more active way to select negative samples that form the dictionary ( or negative memory ) . While dictionaries are efficient ways to perform contrastive learning , this paper showcases that the random selection of negative samples can have a substantive impact on the performance . To resolve this , the paper proposes to select negatives based on two criteria : informativeness measured by the gradients of the sample and diversity ( or representativeness of the potential classes ) through a greedy ( or online ) K-means approach .

While emphasis is good , I found the repetitiveness to affect my interest in reading the paper . I recommend that the authors revisit their manuscript to remove the repetitive argument ( e.g.the notion that you need both informative and diverse negative samples is made in 4 different locations ) . Instead , the authors can provide more insight into the negative dictionary for the variety of models and datasets , showcasing the impact on certain classes .

The paper suggests that an active sampling approach that samples datapoints that are are both diverse and uncertain would result in a much more informative dictionary of negative samples , and uses gradient information and the k-MEANS++ algorithm to create such a dictionary of negatives . They then perform a cross-modal dictionary lookup where the queries and keys for each modality are each represented by a learnt encoder where the parameters of the query encoders are learnt directly via backpropogation and the key encoders ' parameters are defined as a moving average of the query encoders ' parameters . A contrastive loss is then used to learn a representation that is effective for fine-tuning to down-stream tasks , achieving state-of-the-art results for both action recognition and audio event classification . Strengths The paper presents novel , well motivated results in the field of cross-modal representation learning . It includes detailed comparison to the state-of-the-art across a wide selelection of papers and datasets . The proposed method shows state-of-the art results across small , medium and large pre-trained datasets for both action recognition and audio even classification . Weaknesses Whilst there are detailed comparisons between related works the paper does not discuss many of these related works in the related work section . It would be nice to have some more information on the related works , how they relate , how they differ and the gap that this work fits into . Additionaly , some information on the models used for audio and visual encoders would help with understanding . They are described in the appendix but there is no reference to them in the main text . The paper adopts a style wherein the entire process is shown as a single algorithm , and the text describes the algorithm step-by-step . This is , in general , quite clear , however continually changing pages to check the algorithm can decrease readability . Perhaps putting the full algorithm in the appendices and providing a simplified version in the main body would be clearer , or alternatively , splitting the algorithm in to multiple , smaller components . The comparisons to related work are quite detailed , however , in some cases the proposed method offers only a marginal improvement ( particularly for the medium and large datasets ) . Running some experiments multiple times and including error bars would strengthen the state-of-the-art claims . The comparisons could also be improved by consistently comparing across the same architectures . For example , the proposed method is only trained with R ( 2+1 ) D-18 for the large dataset , despite the architecture being widely used within the medium dataset comparisons .

Also , my understanding of the proposed dictionary building / sampling approach for negative sampling is that you look at the magnitude of the gradients with respect to the contrastive learning objective , and pick the examples which give a large gradient magnitude . I think that this could be made clearer for the reader , perhaps by including a toy example , or including a figure in the appendix which showcases the gradient magnitude vs. the chosen negative examples .", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "reply_text": "We appreciate the positive feedback and suggestions to improve our paper ! We have incorporated your suggestions into our revised paper , including : * Algorithm 1 : We replaced the low-level equations with high-level pseudo-code and moved the original version with the full details to the Appendix . * We have added additional results to Figure 5 ( in Appendix ) showcasing the gradient magnitude vs. the chosen negative examples . The results clearly show that hard negatives tend to have larger gradient norms than easy negatives . It provides the evidence showing that gradient magnitude is an effective measurement of the uncertainty of the current model . We add a more detailed analysis in Appendix C ."}}
