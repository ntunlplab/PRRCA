Key idea is to instantiate the compression term of the information bottleneck framework with learned term that sets irrelevant feature dimensions to 0 . To this end , a drop probability is learned for each dimension . Dimensions that have a lower probability than 0.5 ( a fixed threshold ) of being relevant are set to 0 . Strong Points : - The paper is well-written and easy to understand . - Experiments show that DB works better than VIB in VizDoom and DMLab when a noisy-TV noise is added to the input images . Different noisy-TV noises are considered : changing the image when the agent performs an action , adding random noise to the TV , and adding random noise when the agent performs an action . - Experiments also show that the obtained representation is more robust against l_2 and l_inf attacks in ImageNet . Furthermore , the experiments show that the approach can drop many ImageNet features while almost preserving the accuracy of a ResNet . - The paper comes with code in the supplementary material . Weak Points : - I found the reinforcement learning experiments not convincing since only a fixed region of the input is modified by noise ( ie.the noisy TV ) . Hence , the approach essentially identifies irrelevant pixel locations . Such a problem could be solved by a simple pre-processing step . The method wo n't work if the location of the noise changes . In general , limitations of the work are not discussed . - The experiments on ImageNet are more interesting . However , the fact that individual dimensions ( i.e.specific pixel locations ) are identified as irrelevant is still a limiting factor . Furthermore , the experiments do not fit to the focus of this paper on reinforcement learning . - The paper does not discuss connections of the presented approach to prior works for ( discrete ) feature selection . It only discusses connections to prior bottleneck methods . - The paper does not perform experiments on datasets with meaningful features where a feature selection makes more sense than for specific pixels in images . Additional feedback : - It could be stated explicitly that H refers to the entropy . Currently , it is only implicitly defined in Eq.6.- I think it would be better to also cite Jang et . al ( Categorical Reparameterization with Gumbel-Softmax ) for the Concrete relaxation of the Bernoulli distribution . - Figure 1 should either be improved or removed . I do n't see much additional insights that can be gained from this figure . - Of course , it would be very interesting to see if the drop probabilities correlate with the location of the noise inputs .

We will clarify all the concerns in our final draft and make our code public . 1 . * * RL experiments are not convincing - only a fixed region of the input is modified by noise ( the noisy TV task ) . * * A.We adopt the experimental setup from the Savinov et al . ( 2019 ) since it is one of the most popular benchmarks for RL exploration in noisy and sparse-reward environments . Although the reviewer 's comment is correct that the TV screen location is fixed , this setup has been widely used because RL agents have no supervision to simply ignore the fixed region and are easily fooled by the noisy TV even at fixed location , especially when its content is changed based on the agents ' actions ( Burda et al. , 2019a ; b ; Kim et al. , 2019 ; Savinov et al. , 2019 ) . Nonetheless , as suggested , if we let the location of the noisy TV not be fixed , the task will surely be harder . Please excuse that it is extremely hard to obtain the results in this setting during the rebuttal period , because no previous work has used this setting and reproducing all SOTA models in new environments is highly challenging and time-consuming . 2 . * * Individual dimensions ( i.e.specific pixel locations ) are identified as irrelevant & Experiments on datasets with meaningful features * * A . We clarify that our experiments are not equivalent to simply identifying noisy or irrelevant pixel locations in the images . The input to DB $ X $ is not the raw input image but the output of a feature extractor ( e.g. $ f_\\phi $ in Eq . ( 13 ) ) , which is jointly trained with the learnable drop probability ( Section 3.4 ) . In the ImageNet experiments , for example , the feature extractor takes the features from pre-trained Inception-ResNet-V2 as input , following the setup suggested by VIB ( Alemi et al. , 2017 ) ( Section 5.4 ) . In summary , DB can perform both feature learning and feature selection jointly . 3 . * * ImageNet experiments do not fit to the focus of this paper on reinforcement learning * * A . Since DB is a new information bottleneck ( IB ) framework , it is applicable to other tasks that IB can handle . The RL exploration tasks are our main focus but adversarial robustness in image classification is another interesting task to show the effectiveness of DB . 4 . * * Connections of the presented approach to prior works for ( discrete ) feature selection * * A. DB shares a similar idea with feature selection methods to preserve an important subset of feature variables . However , one important difference is that DB allows the joint training of the drop probability and the feature extractor that outputs $ X $ . Moreover , DB can provide improved results compared to the classic feature selection methods in terms of dimensionality reduction and providing adversarial robustness . We have tested and reported the results of other methods ( mutual information-based feature selection and L1 regularization based method ) . For its details , please refer to our response to AnonReviewer3 \u2019 s Q1 ( L1 ) , AnonReviewer4 \u2019 s Q1 ( MI ) , and the updated results in Section 5.4 of our new revision . 5 . * * Additional feedback * * A . We appreciate the additional feedback as well and we happily respond as follows : - We updated the draft to mention that $ H $ denotes the entropy at the first use of the notation ( right after Eq . ( 5 ) ) . - We added a citation to Jang et al . ( Categorical Reparameterization with Gumbel-Softmax ) for the Concrete relaxation of the Bernoulli distribution . - With Figure 1 , we tried to visualize the evolution of episode rewards , since the values reported in Table 1 are the final values and do not show how quickly each method learns , especially for the VizDoom tasks . We updated Section 5.2 to state what can be checked with Figure 1 . - As $ X $ is obtained with the feature extractor , the drop probability and individual pixels are not directly correlated , which makes such analysis difficult . We will try to find other ways for better analysis and to include the results in the camera-ready version ."}, {"review_id": "1rxHOBjeDUW-1", "review_text": "* * Summary * * This paper proposes the Drop-Bottleneck ( DB ) method that performs feature selection during the training with the mutual information . It achieves the state-of-the-art result in few reinforcement learning tasks , and trains a more robust model . * * Originality and significance aspect * * This paper combines mainly two ideas 1 ) classic feature selection ( choose Xis to drop ) with respect to the mutual information ( between X and Y ) 2 ) Information Bottleneck ( IB ) formulation that maximizes the prediction-term mutual information term ( between Z and Y ) and minimizes the compression information ( between X and Z ) simultaneously . It is actually fairly close to the core idea of the feature selection because it finds the compression by dropping the original feature or not unlike the other IB compression methods . In other words , DB is a modernized version of the feature selection that automatically drops a feature based on the IB-style loss . I would say the idea is not entirely new ( somewhat limited ) , but it could be still useful to the community . In the significance aspect , I wanted to see authors to apply this method on other noisy setup tasks ( e.g.computer vision tasks with noise ) , outside of the reinforcement learning tasks . The improvement on the RL tasks seems to be substantial ; however , I would like to know how DB performs when there is correlation between feature dimensions ( see below clarification question to see more details ) . * * Quality and clarity aspect * * The paper was overall easy to follow . Here are a few questions to authors : * What if we just drop the feature space only using the mutual information between X and Y and drop them to achieve a similar number of features that was resulted by DB -- it is basically the classic mutual information feature selection . Would that perform as good as DB ? Can you make a comparison ? I think this should be one of the baseline . If that 's similar to DB , what would be the benefit of DB ? * Does DB always minimize \\hat { I } ( Z ; X ) -- with the independent assumption ? When some of the Xis are correlated ( e.g.consider a vision task ) , there could be quite a gap between I ( Z ; X ) and the independent assumption version . * * Recommendation * * I think the paper is at the borderline .

We will clarify all the concerns in our final draft and make our code public . 1 . * * Discussion with the feature selection methods ( e.g.empirical comparison with the MI feature selection ) * * A . We agree that the idea to drop a subset of less important feature variables is connected to the feature selection methods . However , one of the important differences of DB from them is that it jointly trains not only the drop probability but also the feature extractor that outputs $ X $ ( the input to DB ) with the prediction term ( Section 3.4 ) . Also , we updated Section 5.4 of the draft to include the empirical comparison with the mutual information ( MI ) -based feature selection for dimensionality reduction and adversarial robustness on ImageNet . While DB retains the ImageNet validation accuracy over $ 71\\\\ % $ with only $ 4 $ feature variables , the feature selection method starts failing to achieve $ 70\\\\ % $ when there are $ < 20 $ features and its accuracy drops to $ 9.7\\\\ % $ with $ 4 $ feature variables . Also , the feature selection methods provides almost no adversarial robustness to the targeted $ \\ell_2 $ and $ \\ell_\\infty $ attacks as its resulting attack success rates are all $ \\geq 97\\\\ % $ , whereas DB can reduce the success rate to $ 20\\\\ % $ for the $ \\ell_2 $ and to $ 2\\\\ % $ for the $ \\ell_\\infty $ attacks with $ 8 $ features . 2 . * * Minimization of $ \\hat { I } ( Z ; X ) $ with the independent assumption * * A . Since DB encourages dropping of redundant features from $ X $ , as the training progresses , $ Z $ becomes likely to preserve less-correlated features and thus have small total correlation $ TC ( Z ) $ , which is the gap between $ I ( Z ; X ) $ and $ \\hat { I } ( Z ; X ) $ . That is , although the presented compression term of DB is an upper bound of the true $ I ( Z ; X ) $ , it is learned to decrease the gap as iteration goes . 3 . * * Other noisy setup tasks outside of reinforcement learning * * A . We kindly refer to Appendix B ( or C in the updated draft ) , which experiments the DB \u2019 s ability to remove task-irrelevant information on a vision task - classification with Occluded CIFAR dataset ."}, {"review_id": "1rxHOBjeDUW-2", "review_text": "The paper proposes a new Information Bottleneck objective , which compresses the latent by learning to drop features similar to DropOut . Unlike DropOut , a different probability is learnt for each latent feature/dimension using Concrete Relaxation . The experiments show that the works well . Overall , I score this paper as an accept . While the approach is limited to dropping input features , which does not make it a general IB objective , it seems to work very well in the presented RL experiments as well as show robustness that is better than DVIB \u2019 s . Moreover , the paper is clearly written and engaging . # # # Strengths The paper proposes a simple yet effective idea . Using a Concrete Relaxation to learn DropOut probabilities has been done before , but the idea to have a separate probability per latent dimension is novel . The Drop-Bottleneck objective works directly on the input/latent layer , which means that the compression objective is easy to compute . This is nice because IB terms are usually cumbersome to compute . ( However , this also requires the input/latent to already be disentangled , as dropping out features is limited in its expressiveness . ) The RL experiments on VizDoom and DMLab are convincing as are the ones on ImageNet . The additional experiment on the Occluded CIFAR-10 dataset in the appendix is also well thought-out and shows the advantage of this straightforward method over DVIB . Moreover , once trained , features can be dropped out deterministically if so required , which allows for proper compression and consistent behaviour . # # # Questions Given the simple conceptual idea , this reviewer would be interested to see an ablation with using other methods of enforcing sparsity in the latent . Could L1 regularization of the latent activations be used instead of the $ I [ Z ; X ] $ term ? DB can not provide the same generality as other IB objectives : the input ( latent ) has to be sufficiently disentangled already as the objective itself does not encourage further disentanglement by itself .

We will clarify all the concerns in our final draft and make our code public . 1 . * * Other sparsity-enforcing methods such as L1 regularization of the latent activations * * A . As the review pointed out , the L1 regularization of the latent activations can make each latent vector sparser . On the other hand , DB 's compression term also encourages dropping of feature variables and thus ultimately introduces sparsity to the latent space . One notable benefit of DB \u2019 s sparsity of the \u201c latent space \u201d over L1 \u2019 s sparsity of \u201c each latent vector \u201d is that it can perform the feature dimensionality reduction too for improving the efficiency of the model . Moreover , empirically the L1 regularization is not as good as DB . We tested the L1 regularization to the latent activations ( i.e. $ X $ for DB ) on ImageNet classification from Section 5.4 . When the regularization coefficient is $ \\leq 0.000025 $ , its test accuracy is around $ [ 74\\\\ % ,76\\\\ % ] $ ( smaller than DB 's accuracy with $ \\beta \\leq 0.001 $ ) , and the accuracy quickly drops near to zero at larger coefficient values .

To briefly introduce the setup , the 1536-dimensional features are extracted by a pre-trained Inception-ResNet-V2 on ImageNet and then fed into two trainable fully connected layers with 1024 units each , followed by DB or VIB layer which also has 1024 units ."}, {"review_id": "1rxHOBjeDUW-3", "review_text": "Summary : This paper proposes an information bottleneck method , Drop-Bottleneck , that allows the input to be compressed by dropping each input feature with probability p_i .

We will clarify all the concerns in our final draft and make our code public . 1 . * * Other sparsity-enforcing methods such as L1 regularization of the latent activations * * A . As the review pointed out , the L1 regularization of the latent activations can make each latent vector sparser . On the other hand , DB 's compression term also encourages dropping of feature variables and thus ultimately introduces sparsity to the latent space . One notable benefit of DB \u2019 s sparsity of the \u201c latent space \u201d over L1 \u2019 s sparsity of \u201c each latent vector \u201d is that it can perform the feature dimensionality reduction too for improving the efficiency of the model . Moreover , empirically the L1 regularization is not as good as DB . We tested the L1 regularization to the latent activations ( i.e. $ X $ for DB ) on ImageNet classification from Section 5.4 . When the regularization coefficient is $ \\leq 0.000025 $ , its test accuracy is around $ [ 74\\\\ % ,76\\\\ % ] $ ( smaller than DB 's accuracy with $ \\beta \\leq 0.001 $ ) , and the accuracy quickly drops near to zero at larger coefficient values . We have tested and reported the results of another feature selection method ( mutual information-based one ) . For its details , please refer to our response to AnonReviewer4 \u2019 s Q1 and the updated results in Section 5.4 . 2 . * * DB \u2019 s generality as other IB objectives - What if the input should already be disentangled ? * * A.We jointly train the learnable drop probability and the feature extractor that outputs $ X $ ( e.g. $ f_\\phi $ in Eq . ( 13 ) ) . It makes DB less dependent on raw input data because it can learn optimal embeddings for DB together . Also , since DB encourages dropping of redundant features from $ X $ , as the training progresses , $ Z $ becomes likely to preserve less correlated features . 3 . * * Do the ImageNet experiments use extracted/pre-trained embedding as latents ? * * A.We follow the experimental setup suggested by VIB ( Alemi et al. , 2017 ) for the ImageNet experiments ( Section 5.4 ) . To briefly introduce the setup , the 1536-dimensional features are extracted by a pre-trained Inception-ResNet-V2 on ImageNet and then fed into two trainable fully connected layers with 1024 units each , followed by DB or VIB layer which also has 1024 units ."}, "3": {"review_id": "1rxHOBjeDUW-3", "review_text": "Summary : This paper proposes an information bottleneck method , Drop-Bottleneck , that allows the input to be compressed by dropping each input feature with probability p_i . The model then learns the drop probability vector p = [ p_1 , ... , p_n ] , where dropping `` redundant '' features will reduce the `` compression penalty '' term I ( XZ ) . The approach is demonstrated in experiments in ( 1 ) robust exploration setting for RL , ( 2 ) adversarial attacks on ImageNet , and ( 3 ) an experiment showing that their approach is able to maintain performance on ImageNet with reduced dimensionality . Evaluation : I found this paper to be clear and the experiments seem reasonable . I do n't know of any prior work that takes this approach . I 'm not an RL expert so I wo n't comment on the strength of the RL results , other than that their methods were clear and they seem to have been careful and fair in choosing baselines . My biggest criticism is that the robustness experiments on ImageNet compare to VIB ( Alemi et al 2017 ) as a baseline , but they should really compare to the more recent adversarial results on Conditional Entropy Bottleneck ( another information bottleneck approach that outperforms VIB ) given in Fischer and Alemi 2020 ( https : //arxiv.org/pdf/2002.05380.pdf ) . I 'd like to see that added to the revised version .", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We appreciate your valuable comments . We will clarify all the concerns in our final draft and make our code public . 1 . * * Comparison with more recent Information Bottleneck methods such as Conditional Entropy Bottleneck ( Fischer and Alemi , 2020 ) * * A . Following your suggestion , we are implementing and experimenting the CEB method in our settings , but due to the limited time of rebuttal and the fairly large amount of computing resources required by the adversarial tests , we have not finished the experiments yet . Once we obtain results , we will update this reply and the draft again . * * ( Updated ) * * We have uploaded our new revision , which includes the comparison with CEB in the adversarial robustness experiments in Appendix B ( due to the 9-page limit ) . To summarize the results , while CEB also provides the meaningful robustness to the attacks , DB shows the lower ( i.e.better ) attack success rates in both the targeted $ \\ell_2 $ and $ \\ell_\\infty $ attacks . For the $ \\ell_2 $ attacks , DB achieves $ 18.5\\\\ % $ at $ \\beta = 0.01 $ , and CEB best scores $ 45\\\\ % $ at ( final ) $ \\rho = 3.454 $ .
