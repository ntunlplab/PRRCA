If it is correct , how can the bias be corrected just by training with other objects ? Does it affect to reduce ||B ( h , c ) || in Definition 3.3 ? Please clarify it . The rationale behind our approach is covered at the end of Section 3.1 . The naive method for controlling the bias with respect to Theorem 3.1 would be : for each training sample use the context of the current maximum bias , i.e. , argmax_c ||B ( h , c ) || . Unfortunately , as we note , this optimization problem is computationally intractable in general . Our heuristic is based on the observation that the most recent training sample can be repurposed as a context of large bias for the next training sample . We believe our experiments support this heuristic . First , we are able to generalize from synthetic to several real-world datasets , and our ablation studies show that this heuristic contributes significantly to achieving such performance ( Figure 1 ) . We also compare our classifiers against training directly on real-world data , and show that our classifiers are far more robust to background perturbations than the classifiers trained using real-world data , i.e. , our method does indeed succeed in producing classifiers which are empirically context-agnostic ( Figure 3 ) . This evaluation further demonstrates that initialization using our bias heuristic gives a much stronger attack than a random initialization , even when the attack is unbounded , suggesting that the contexts returned by the bias heuristic are indeed closer to the optimum . > In addition , the effectiveness of the proposed method can be verified with such simple tasks , but it is advisable to add a discussion about more complex tasks such as object detection that requires more diverse contexts . This will be more interesting for many . Object detection is an interesting extension . For now , we have focused on classification because it makes the theoretical development cleaner , and we felt it was important that both the setting and results be easily interpretable . However the suggestion to include a section discussing more complex tasks is well-received and we will use a portion of the additional page limit to this . > As a minor correction , In Section 3.2 , the object error o^ is defined but not used anywhere .

They propose to decompose factors contributing to the risk into two , context bias and object error . Based on this interpretation , an algorithm is designed to 'greedily correct bias ' while employing adversarial training ( or robustness training ) for 'local refinement ' . The method achieves high accuracy on two synthetic visual tasks , digits and traffic sign classification , when a model is trained using one sample per class from the source domain and tested on an unseen target domain . + ) Theorem 3.1 provides a new view on risk . Risk is decomposed into two factors , context bias and object error . I think this gives new insight to consider the effect of context bias and object modeling on risk separately . + ) The experimental results are impressive because the model is trained using a very limited number of samples ( one sample per class from the source domain ) but showed high generalization performance on an unseen domain .

However , if stochastic gradient descent is used for optimization , I think it is unlikely because the model changes continuously . Therefore , it is uncertain how effective this greedy selection strategy can sample contexts with large bias . The greedy bias correction heuristic aims to solve an optimization objective which is computational intractable in general , namely , identifying the context with the highest bias . We do not claim that our heuristic successfully identifies contexts with the `` largest '' bias , but we believe our experimental results support that our heuristic identifies contexts of `` sufficiently large '' bias . First , as noted we achieve good performance on real-world datasets , and the ablation studies show our heuristic gives much better generalization than randomly sampling from the context space . Second , in Figure 3 we validate the empirical context bias of various classifiers by fixing the foreground and varying the background . In particular , initialization using our bias heuristic gives a much stronger attack than a random initialization , even when the attack is unbounded , suggesting that the contexts returned by the bias heuristic are indeed closer to the optimum . Regarding the interaction of our heuristic with SGD , the contexts are continuously updated along with the model , so we 're not sure why SGD should present a particular challenge ( perhaps the reviewer can clarify this point ? ) > Relating to the above point , I also have a concern about the experimental validation . In all the experiments , gamma is defined as a function that takes object and context images and outputs their overlap . It is not guaranteed that the proposed heuristic sampling strategy generalizes to other gamma functions . The reviewer raises a good point about the observation function being similar across experiments . We do not think this is a significant weakness however , as many types of noise manifest additively in the signal , particularly noise which arises from natural observations ( e.g. , the background of images , noise in audio clips , measurement noise for sensors , etc . ) . For instance , the Kalman filter is another example of a model that assumes additive noise , but this has not prevented it from being widely used ( perhaps most famously in the navigation systems of manned missions to the moon ) . > Also , all the experiments are performed for a relatively small number of classes ( up to 50 ) , and synthetic images are small iconic images with objects in the center .

In fact , the only requirements for applying greedy bias correction are 1 ) a decomposition of the input space into object and context spaces , and 2 ) the ability to sample from the object and context spaces independently . In our heuristic , we suggest drawing samples from the object space uniformly at random ; thus , it is straightforward to apply our techniques when there are multiple images ( not necessarily synthetic ) for each object class . Likewise , there is no restriction on using information from the target domain , though practically speaking , we argue that the ability of our approach to generalize even in absence of any target information is a significant strength of our approach . > The quality of the paper will be upgraded if the authors further investigate more data augmentation or style transfer methods in related work and ablation study .

Please let us know if the following responses leave any concerns unaddressed . > My concern is the presentation . `` Context '' and `` context-agnostic '' are properly defined . However , it is very difficult to understand how to achieve `` context-agnostic '' in algorithm 1 and 2 . In my understanding , context bias is corrected by forcing a model trained using the opposite ( or other ) object class in the same context in the next training iteration . If it is correct , how can the bias be corrected just by training with other objects ? Does it affect to reduce ||B ( h , c ) || in Definition 3.3 ? Please clarify it . The rationale behind our approach is covered at the end of Section 3.1 . The naive method for controlling the bias with respect to Theorem 3.1 would be : for each training sample use the context of the current maximum bias , i.e. , argmax_c ||B ( h , c ) || . Unfortunately , as we note , this optimization problem is computationally intractable in general . Our heuristic is based on the observation that the most recent training sample can be repurposed as a context of large bias for the next training sample . We believe our experiments support this heuristic . First , we are able to generalize from synthetic to several real-world datasets , and our ablation studies show that this heuristic contributes significantly to achieving such performance ( Figure 1 ) . We also compare our classifiers against training directly on real-world data , and show that our classifiers are far more robust to background perturbations than the classifiers trained using real-world data , i.e. , our method does indeed succeed in producing classifiers which are empirically context-agnostic ( Figure 3 ) . This evaluation further demonstrates that initialization using our bias heuristic gives a much stronger attack than a random initialization , even when the attack is unbounded , suggesting that the contexts returned by the bias heuristic are indeed closer to the optimum . > In addition , the effectiveness of the proposed method can be verified with such simple tasks , but it is advisable to add a discussion about more complex tasks such as object detection that requires more diverse contexts . This will be more interesting for many . Object detection is an interesting extension . For now , we have focused on classification because it makes the theoretical development cleaner , and we felt it was important that both the setting and results be easily interpretable . However the suggestion to include a section discussing more complex tasks is well-received and we will use a portion of the additional page limit to this . > As a minor correction , In Section 3.2 , the object error o^ is defined but not used anywhere . The object error is used in the statement of Theorem 3.1 -- we will address this in our revision ."}, "2": {"review_id": "_Tf6jEzbH9-2", "review_text": "The paper defines the task of context-agnostic learning and proposes an algorithm to solve the problem while assuming the ability to sample objects and contexts independently . They propose to decompose factors contributing to the risk into two , context bias and object error . Based on this interpretation , an algorithm is designed to 'greedily correct bias ' while employing adversarial training ( or robustness training ) for 'local refinement ' . The method achieves high accuracy on two synthetic visual tasks , digits and traffic sign classification , when a model is trained using one sample per class from the source domain and tested on an unseen target domain . + ) Theorem 3.1 provides a new view on risk . Risk is decomposed into two factors , context bias and object error . I think this gives new insight to consider the effect of context bias and object modeling on risk separately . + ) The experimental results are impressive because the model is trained using a very limited number of samples ( one sample per class from the source domain ) but showed high generalization performance on an unseen domain . The proposed method achieves promising performance on two synthetic classification tasks compared to other existing methods for few-shot learning and domain adaptation , which requires more labeled or unlabeled data during training . - ) Their underlying assumption for greedy bias correction is that a classifier learns a strong bias on recent training inputs when taken as contexts .

Please see our responses below , and we would appreciate follow up discussions if anything remains unclear . > Their underlying assumption for greedy bias correction is that a classifier learns a strong bias on recent training inputs when taken as contexts . However , if stochastic gradient descent is used for optimization , I think it is unlikely because the model changes continuously . Therefore , it is uncertain how effective this greedy selection strategy can sample contexts with large bias . The greedy bias correction heuristic aims to solve an optimization objective which is computational intractable in general , namely , identifying the context with the highest bias . We do not claim that our heuristic successfully identifies contexts with the `` largest '' bias , but we believe our experimental results support that our heuristic identifies contexts of `` sufficiently large '' bias . First , as noted we achieve good performance on real-world datasets , and the ablation studies show our heuristic gives much better generalization than randomly sampling from the context space . Second , in Figure 3 we validate the empirical context bias of various classifiers by fixing the foreground and varying the background . In particular , initialization using our bias heuristic gives a much stronger attack than a random initialization , even when the attack is unbounded , suggesting that the contexts returned by the bias heuristic are indeed closer to the optimum . Regarding the interaction of our heuristic with SGD , the contexts are continuously updated along with the model , so we 're not sure why SGD should present a particular challenge ( perhaps the reviewer can clarify this point ? ) > Relating to the above point , I also have a concern about the experimental validation . In all the experiments , gamma is defined as a function that takes object and context images and outputs their overlap . It is not guaranteed that the proposed heuristic sampling strategy generalizes to other gamma functions . The reviewer raises a good point about the observation function being similar across experiments . We do not think this is a significant weakness however , as many types of noise manifest additively in the signal , particularly noise which arises from natural observations ( e.g. , the background of images , noise in audio clips , measurement noise for sensors , etc . ) . For instance , the Kalman filter is another example of a model that assumes additive noise , but this has not prevented it from being widely used ( perhaps most famously in the navigation systems of manned missions to the moon ) . > Also , all the experiments are performed for a relatively small number of classes ( up to 50 ) , and synthetic images are small iconic images with objects in the center .

This paper studies a theoretical setting for learning models whose predictions are independent of background signals .

Please let us know if there are any points that require further elaboration . > The proposed method has a strict restriction : The training sets must have a single synthetic image for each object class with no additional information about the target domain . This may limit the training of the model in some hard conditions . In fact , the only requirements for applying greedy bias correction are 1 ) a decomposition of the input space into object and context spaces , and 2 ) the ability to sample from the object and context spaces independently . In our heuristic , we suggest drawing samples from the object space uniformly at random ; thus , it is straightforward to apply our techniques when there are multiple images ( not necessarily synthetic ) for each object class . Likewise , there is no restriction on using information from the target domain , though practically speaking , we argue that the ability of our approach to generalize even in absence of any target information is a significant strength of our approach . > The quality of the paper will be upgraded if the authors further investigate more data augmentation or style transfer methods in related work and ablation study . Since the context and object concepts are similar with the style and content in some GANs and transferring works Thank you for the suggestion ! Style transfer does seem conceptually related , though GANs still require a large amount of images to learn , so we do n't think they can be applied in the setting of our experiments . Note that we already cite several GAN-based approaches for domain adaptation -- if there are any specific suggestions we would be happy to include them in the discussion . > The experiments seem a little bit weak . The experiments are only conducted on two simple datasets , i.e.GTSRB and MINST . Our results actually include a third dataset , Omniglot , which is a standard dataset for few-shot learning . This task differs from MNIST in that there are 1623 character classes , each of which is drawn by the same 20 people ; the general idea is that Omniglot is about learning many characters over a small set of handwritings , whereas MNIST is about learning a small set of characters over many different handwritings .
