The new scoring function, as it is accompanied by the generative model, provides interesting theoretical results that the reviewers also appreciate. Finally, the results are quite strong, as they obtain state-of-art on the primary benchmarks for the task.\n\nBased on the submitted version, the reviewers and AC note the following potential weaknesses: (1) the reviewers felt that the proposed work is a direct application of the random-walk model from Arora et al. and thus limited in novelty, (2) given the generative model, the reviewers felt that the paper would benefit from an analysis of the learned embeddings, and their difference from ones from existing approaches, (3) The reviewers noted that the authors were using an incorrect version of FB15k and WN18, (4) the authors were not providing results for all the metrics, (5) the coverage of related work is quite limited.\n\nThe authors addressed many of the concerns raised by the reviewers in their comments and revision, in particular, they obtained state-of-art results for the corrected versions of the benchmarks. Further, they clarified the assumptions made in their modeling and revised the related work to include the papers that the reviewers mentioned. However, the concerns regarding the lack of novelty of the proposed approach, w.r.t Arora et al 2016 and the need for further analysis of the learned embeddings, still remain.\n\nThis paper comes really close to getting accepted, but ultimately the reviewers agree that the remaining concerns need to be addressed.", "reviews": [{"review_id": "SkxbDsR9Ym-0", "review_text": "This paper proposes to perform the link prediction in knowledge bases by introducing a new scoring function and theoretically motivating their method. The authors validate their proposed approach through several experiments. This paper reads well and the results appear sound. I personally find the theoretical argument behind the proposed scoring function very interesting. Unfortunately, the contribution seems rather small to be accepted for ICLR. This is a straight application and combination of existing pieces with not much originality and without being backed up by very strong experimental results. My concerns are as follows: - Having only results on two flawed datasets (considering the inverse relations in them) makes it hard to evaluate the quality of the method. I suggest conducting the experiments on the FB15K-237 and WN18RR from [1] instead. - You only evaluate on MR and Hits@10, but it is standard to include metrics like MRR and Hits@1 and 3 also, since no metric is perfect for this task. - Since the goal of the work is not providing a state of the art method, and focus on the theoretical understanding of their scoring function, it is of high importance to assess the characteristics of their embeddings and scoring function through designing other experiments. As a result, I suggest to study the geometric behavior of their embeddings and compare it to the other methods.

How do you know it is exp function but not other function? 3. I am not sure what the purpose for the evaluation section is. You mention that this paper is not about state-of-the-art results, but if you theory really works, your scoring function should beat SOTA results.

Ans : We would like to thank the reviewer for the time and review . It is true that we are extending the original Random Walk model proposed by Arora et al [ 2016a ] to model relations . However , we do not agree that is a \u201c very obvious application \u201d . Next , we detail the reasons for this . The original random walk model was proposed for a co-occurrence graph , ignoring the relations between the entities . It is nontrivial as how to incorporate relational information into this model . We have both proposed a new relational version of the original random walk model and have proven that it can obtain state-of-the-art knowledge graph embeddings .

How do you know it is exp function but not other function ? Ans : This is a very standard way to represent the potential function in a probabilistic graph .

In fact , prior work on kernel methods have shown that exponential kernels such as Radial Basis Functions ( RBF ) kernel can theoretically subsume all other types of kernel functions .
