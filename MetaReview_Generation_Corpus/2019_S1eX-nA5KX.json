For the text-based ZSL task , the key to success is to explore the relationship between all the images in a class ( not a single image ) and its class-specific textual description . For this purpose , a Variational Hetero-Encoder is proposed for this task , exhibiting good performance with a shared latent space extracted from these two modes . Though PGBN and GAN have been used to represent text and image , respectively , they have not been successfully combined to find the relationship between these two modes and the ZSL task . Compared with PGBN , an encoder network is used perform end-to-end inference , serving as the source distribution for GAN , which further reinforce the effect of text on image generation . Using PGBN instead of recurrent VAE and using GAN instead of VAE are due to the following reasons : First , it has been observed that the fully-connected VAE is not expressive enough for 64 * 64 RGB images and the deconvolutional VAE is hard to converge , which can be solved by GAN . Second , our task focuses on ZSL classification . Although a sequential description could be excellent at defining a specific individual image , the key words are more effective to define a class of images ( not a specific image ) . In addition , recurrent VAE often fails for long sequential texts , e.g. , the description of an image class in encyclopedia often consists of thousands of words . Therefore , we extract bag-of-words features and use PGBN for textual generation , which is more suitable for the ZSL task . Indeed , we have clearly identified semantic connections between the images and some key words in the class-specific textual descriptions , which have been effectively captured by our model , as illustrated in Figs . 2-6 in the revised manuscript .

The topic model and the VHE shares the topic parameters, and the GAN generate an image regarding the topic. Then, for ZSL, the image is encoded to corresponding topic parameters, and the parameter can tell which text description (unseen) is matched with the highest probability. GAN model is used to generate an image given the topic distribution. During the training of the GAN, the VHE and topic model is jointly trained and can enhance the ZSL performance marginally. [pros] - This work successfully incorporated the topic model and image encoding/decoding. All the individual parts are already given, but I think incorporating them in terms of a unified probabilistic model is also meaningful for this field. - This work shows superior performance on the image to text ZSL problem. - This work mapped the text to image, image to text mapping in a generative manner. [cons] - The problem is only valid when the unseen class distribution is very similar to the given classes. For example, the text description of unseen classes should be well represented to the topics from seen classes. - It is doubtful that this corresponds to the term zero-shot learning; dealing with the case that the unseen class and the seen class are notably different from each other. - Similarly, GAN learns images from the seen classes, and by nature, GAN would not generate the proper images of the unseen class if the image distribution of the unseen class is different to the already seen class. In the paper, the classes are very similar to each other (birds, flowers) and that would be the reason GAN worked in this model. - (minor) The likelihood of the text (image) given topic should be provided and compared to the existing models. [Summary] - The reviewer is personally interested in the proposal of the work, but concern that ZSL is difficult to be the main target of the paper because the model can only deal with the classes with (very) similar semantics, and this is the main reason for the rating. The testing with more diverse class should be given, or solid explanation of the mentioned problem would be required.

In other words , they are dealing ZSL as the case that the seen and unseen classes are related in some feature space to some extent , though they have not specified the meaning of the shared features explicitly . In our work , we give the ZSL task an interpretable shared latent space , connecting the relationships between the images structures and the key words , whose effectiveness is validated on benchmark datasets following the widely used experimental protocols for text-based ZSL .

Q2 : The problem is only valid when the unseen class distribution is very similar to the given classes .

In the paper , the classes are very similar to each other ( birds , flowers ) and that would be the reason GAN worked in this model . A3 : According to the available ZSL protocols , the seen and unseen classes are related more or less .

First , a text representation is used to define a class of images ( not just a single image ) . In such circumstance , compared with the sequential information , the key words are more general and effective to define a certain image class .

What \u2019 s more , lower error bars are achieved by our proposed models , demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed posterior representation at multiple stochastic layers . In addition , although GAZSL exhibits higher accuracy on some metrics , it relies on an extra visual part detection that needs additional resources and elaborate tuning for different classes . As a result , as the original GAZSL only designs part detector for Birds , it is not suitable to perform ZSL on Flower .
