Since the encoder also predicts \\hat{y} it can be used for classification and the paper shows competitive results on this task, apart from the attribute manipulation task. Reviewers had raised points about model complexity and connections to prior works which the authors have addressed and the paper is on the borderline based on the scores. \n\nThough none of the reviewers explicitly pointed out the similarity of the paper with Fader networks (Lample et al., 2017), the adversarial setup for getting attribute invariant 'z' is exactly same as in Fader networks, as also pointed out in an anonymous comment. The only difference is that encoder in the current paper also predicts the attribute itself (\\hat{y}), which is not the case in Fader n/w, and hence the encoder can be used as a classifier as well (authors have also mentioned and discussed this difference in their response). However, the core idea of the paper as outlined in the title of the paper, ie, using adversarial loss for information factorization, is very similar to this earlier work, which diminishes the originality of the work. \n\nWith the borderline review scores, the paper can go in either of the half-spaces (accept/reject) but I am hesitant to recommend an \"accept\" due to limited originality of the approach. However, if there is space in the program, the paper can be accepted. ", "reviews": [{"review_id": "BJfRpoA9YX-0", "review_text": "In this paper, the authors introduce a neural network architecture that has three components. First a VAE is used to encode images in to two latent states \\hat{y} and \\hat{z}, with \\hat{z} intended to be class (e.g. face attribute) agnostic. The decoder reconstructs images from \\hat{y} and \\hat{z} concatenated together. A GAN style discriminator attempts to distinguish the decoded image from the original input image as real or fake, allowing the decoder to produce higher quality decoded images. An auxiliary network A attempts to classify the face attribute y from the class agnostic features \\hat{z}, with the idea being that the encoder should try to produce \\hat{z} vectors from which the class cannot be predicted. An additional classifier is trained using a classification loss \\hat{L}_{class} on the encoded reconstructed image, the use of which I don't understand. I think additional work on section 2.5 through section 3 would be helpful to improve clarity. As one example, \"y\" is unnecessarily overloaded: y denotes a specific attribute, \\hat{y} denotes a latent vector that is intended to not be class agnostic, \\tilde{y} denotes the prediction of an auxiliary network on an intended class-agnostic latent vector \\hat{z} of the presence of the original attribute y, and \\hat{\\hat{y}} denotes the non agnostic latent vector achieved by passing the decoded image back through the encoder. This notational complexity is compounded by the fact that a number of steps in the method are not well motivated in the text, and left to the reader to understand their purpose. For example, the authors state that \"we incorporate a classification model into the encoder so that our model may easily be used to perform classification tasks.\" What does this mean? In the diagram (Figure 1), where is this classification model? Why in the GAN loss is there a term that compares the fake loss with the result of classifying a decoded z vector? Is this z \\hat{z}, or a latent vector drawn from a distribution p(z)? If it is the former, how does this term differ from the second term in the GAN loss. If it is the latter, then shouldn't it be concatenated with some y in order to be used as input to the decoder D_{\\theta}? Why is it important to extract \\hat{\\hat{y}} from \\hat{x}? In the paper you state that the loss \"provides a gradient containing label information to the decoder,\" but why can't we use the known label y of the original input x to ensure that the encoder and decoder preserve this information if it is used as \\hat{y}? Later in the paper, you explicitly state that \\hat{\\mathcal{L}_{class}} \"does not provide any clear benefit.\" If that is the case, then you should ideally include it neither in the model nor in the paper. If it was included primarily because previous models included it, then I would recommend you introduce its use in a background section on Bao et al., 2017 rather than including it in your model description with an explanation like \"so that our model may easily be used to perform classification tasks.\" Ultimately, this last point brings us to a good summary of my concerns with the model: the inclusion of too many moving parts, some of which the authors explicitly say later on provide no benefit. Moving on to experimental results, I think this is another area where I have a few concerns. First, in Figure 2, the authors argue that your model is \"better for 6 out of 10 attributes\" and comparable results for most others. The authors include a gap of 0.1 in the \"Gray_hair\" category as \"better\" but label a gap of 0.5 in the Black hair category as \"comparable.\" I think results in several of the categories are sufficiently close that error bars would be necessary to draw actual conclusions. If \"better\" were to mean \"better by 0.5\" for example, then the authors method is better on 4 tasks (smiling, blonde hair, heavy makeup, mustache) and worse on 3 (black hair, brown hair, wavy hair). With respect to the actual attribute editing, my main concern here is a lack of comparison to models other than Bao et al., despite the fact that face attribute changing is an exhaustively studied task. A number of papers like Perarnau et al., 2016, Upchurch et al., 2017, Lample et al., 2017 and others study this task from machine learning perspectives, and in some cases can perform photorealistic image attribute editing without complicated machinery on megapixel face images. At least the images in Figure 3 and 4 are substantially downsampled from the typical resolution found in the Celeba dataset, suggesting that there was some failure mode on full resolution images. ---- Edit: I've reviewed the authors' addressing my concerns in their paper and am happy to increase my rating as a result.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "The reviewer 's main concerns appear to be complexity of the model and comparison to related work .

In order to disentangle the identity information from the attributes the paper proposes adversarial information factorization : let z be the latent code and y be the attribute the paper proposes to have p(y) = p(y|z= E_phi(x)), i.e to have z independent of y. This disentanglement is implemented through a GAN on the variable y min _phi Distance (p(y), p(y|z)), the distance is defined via a discriminator on y. Experiments are presented on celeba dataset, 1) on attribute manipulation from smiling to non smiling for example, on 2) attribute classification results are presented , 3) ablation studies are given to study the effect of each component of the model highlighting the effect of the adversarial information factorization.
