( 2 ) We add the runtime importance predictor $ f ( \\cdot ) $ and the static pruning importance $ u_s $ for each convolutional layer of the backbone CNN . Eq.6 and Eq.2 are applied on the output of convolution layers . ( 3 ) We train runtime importance predictor $ f ( \\cdot ) $ and static pruning importance $ u_s $ . We initialize $ u_s $ as 1s and randomly initialize the weights of $ f ( \\cdot ) $ . The sparsity ratios $ d_s $ and $ d_r $ are fixed to 1 .

Static pruning depends only on the training dataset and is computed once before the model is deployed. Dynamic pruning is input-dependent. The policies are obtained with deep reinforcement learning on the training dataset using a combination of the loss function and storage/computation resource budgets as a reward signal. The key novelty in this paper is to combine static and dynamic pruning which can obtain the benefits from both worlds. Experimentally, the learned pruning policies are competitive with recent dynamic pruning approaches on CIFAR-10 and ILSVRC2012, in terms of both final test accuracy and number of parameters/inference time. Overall, I do like the idea of combining static and dynamic pruning, the DRL approach is reasonable and it seems to do well in practice. However, there are some key issues that must be addressed by the authors.

We have added a comparison experiment in Appendix A.1 . In this experiment , we compare our method with an additional baseline , which combines the static pruning method FPGM ( He et al.2019 ) and the dynamic pruning method FBS ( Gao et al.2019 ) .For fair comparison , we first use FPGM to prune M-CifarNet with sparsity ratios of 0.75 and then prune M-CifarNet by FBS with sparsity ratios of 2/3 .

On the same hardware platform , an epoch of FBS is about 24s . Due to the training procedure of FBS , it first sets sparsity $ d=1 $ and finetunes the network .

Our method needs 400 epochs ( approximately 3.33 hours ) for pretraining runtime importance predictor $ f ( \\cdot ) $ and static pruning importance $ u_s $ .

The combination allows the static pruner to decrease the required storage while the dynamic pruning can optimize the required compute using input-dependent pruned weights. The RL agent can dynamically learn the optimal sparsity distribution among the different layer of the networks while staying under a resource constraint as opposed to other methods which often enforce a layer level sparsity ratio. It demonstrates the efficacy of the algorithm on CIFAR10 and ILSVRC2012 and showed the effect of the tradeoff between static and dynamic pruning. Overall I believe this paper is a borderline accept. It proposes a unified framework to manage the trade-off between static pruning to decrease storage requirements and network flexibility for dynamic pruning to decrease runtime costs. The empirical results demonstrate the capability of the framework but would benefit from some clarification and additional ablations. Pros: Proposed an RL formulation of a unified framework for static and dynamic channel pruning. The empirical results demonstrate the ability of the model to achieve high accuracy while sparsifying the compute and balancing storage consumption and accuracy. Strong results are shown for CIFAR10 and ILSVRC2012. Demonstrated a tradeoff between static pruning and runtime-pruning through ablation of R_r. Cons: It is unclear how speed-up calculated. Is it wall clock and benchmarked on what device? What was the cost of running the RL agent during runtime? If you are computing MACs, that should be reported as such unless a strong correlation can be proven with the particular pruning scheme. MAC reduction does not translate directly to speedup in hardware. It could be clearer if the ablation of R_r also demonstrated a storage/accuracy tradeoff. It is unclear if similar results may be achieved by first running a static pruning and then separately training a dynamic pruning algorithm on the already statically pruned network? It might benefit from an ablation study with and without simultaneously training static pruning? Some of the algorithmic details could benefit from some clarification. In section 3.2, it is unclear to me the effect of R_r during training. It seems that the agent could learn to over select channels to prune to adapt to R_r. Section 3.4 seems to lack inclusion of R_r in the number of statically pruned values. The treatment of M_0 in section 3.2 separate from M_r and M_s seems to make the number of statically pruned filters during training depend on the layers chosen by dynamic pruning. It seems like it may cause differing sparsity between training and inference time.", "rating": "6: Weak Accept", "reply_text": "Thanks for the constructive comment .

Our method needs 400 epochs ( approximately 3.33 hours ) for pretraining runtime importance predictor $ f ( \\cdot ) $ and static pruning importance $ u_s $ . Then our methods directly adapt to target sparsity . It requires 128 DRL agents epochs and 64 backbone CNN epochs , approximately 2.48 hours . Our method needs approximately 5.81 hours of training for a specified sparsity ratio .

The combination allows the static pruner to decrease the required storage while the dynamic pruning can optimize the required compute using input-dependent pruned weights. The RL agent can dynamically learn the optimal sparsity distribution among the different layer of the networks while staying under a resource constraint as opposed to other methods which often enforce a layer level sparsity ratio. It demonstrates the efficacy of the algorithm on CIFAR10 and ILSVRC2012 and showed the effect of the tradeoff between static and dynamic pruning. Overall I believe this paper is a borderline accept. It proposes a unified framework to manage the trade-off between static pruning to decrease storage requirements and network flexibility for dynamic pruning to decrease runtime costs. The empirical results demonstrate the capability of the framework but would benefit from some clarification and additional ablations. Pros: Proposed an RL formulation of a unified framework for static and dynamic channel pruning. The empirical results demonstrate the ability of the model to achieve high accuracy while sparsifying the compute and balancing storage consumption and accuracy. Strong results are shown for CIFAR10 and ILSVRC2012. Demonstrated a tradeoff between static pruning and runtime-pruning through ablation of R_r. Cons: It is unclear how speed-up calculated. Is it wall clock and benchmarked on what device? What was the cost of running the RL agent during runtime? If you are computing MACs, that should be reported as such unless a strong correlation can be proven with the particular pruning scheme. MAC reduction does not translate directly to speedup in hardware. It could be clearer if the ablation of R_r also demonstrated a storage/accuracy tradeoff. It is unclear if similar results may be achieved by first running a static pruning and then separately training a dynamic pruning algorithm on the already statically pruned network? It might benefit from an ablation study with and without simultaneously training static pruning? Some of the algorithmic details could benefit from some clarification. In section 3.2, it is unclear to me the effect of R_r during training. It seems that the agent could learn to over select channels to prune to adapt to R_r. Section 3.4 seems to lack inclusion of R_r in the number of statically pruned values. The treatment of M_0 in section 3.2 separate from M_r and M_s seems to make the number of statically pruned filters during training depend on the layers chosen by dynamic pruning. It seems like it may cause differing sparsity between training and inference time.", "rating": "6: Weak Accept", "reply_text": "Thanks for the constructive comment . We would like to address your concerns as follow . Q1 : \u201c It is unclear how speed-up calculated . Is it wall clock and benchmarked on what device ? What was the cost of running the RL agent during runtime ? If you are computing MACs , that should be reported as such unless a strong correlation can be proven with the particular pruning scheme . MAC reduction does not translate directly to speedup in hardware. \u201d R1 : The \u201c speed-up \u201d mentioned in Table 1 , 2 and 3 are calculated on MACs . We have clarified it in the latest version of our paper . The computation cost of running RL agent in inference is tiny compared to the cost of the convolutional layer . We use global pooling to extract features from the feature map , and then feed them into a fully-connected encoder to produce a state $ s_t^r $ , which is only of 128 dimensions . The state $ s_t^r $ is fed into a simple RNN of 128 dimensions , followed by a fully-connected layer to produce a scalar action . The MACs of the RL agent is 0.21 % of the pretrained network . Q2 : \u201c It could be clearer if the ablation of R_r also demonstrated a storage/accuracy tradeoff. \u201d R2 : We have added Fig.4 in Appendix to further demonstrate the storage/accuracy tradeoff . Q3 : \u201c It is unclear if similar results may be achieved by first running a static pruning and then separately training a dynamic pruning algorithm on the already statically pruned network ? It might benefit from an ablation study with and without simultaneously training static pruning ? \u201d R3 : To address this issue , we have added a new comparison experiment with the method that first statically prunes channels , and then dynamically prunes the rest channels . The experimental results are presented in Appendix A.1 . It shows that our simultaneously training strategy achieves better performance than the separately training strategy . Q4. \u201c In section 3.2 , it is unclear to me the effect of R_r during training . It seems that the agent could learn to over select channels to prune to adapt to R_r . Section 3.4 seems to lack inclusion of R_r in the number of statically pruned values . The treatment of M_0 in section 3.2 separate from M_r and M_s seems to make the number of statically pruned filters during training depend on the layers chosen by dynamic pruning . It seems like it may cause differing sparsity between training and inference time. \u201d R4 : Sorry for unclear explanation in the original submission . Before we explain the effect of $ R_r $ here , we would like to correct a term in section 3.4 : \u201c Channels with $ ( ( 1-a^s_t ) /2 ) -smallest $ \u2026 \u201d -- > \u201c Channels with $ ( ( 1-a^s_t ) ( 1-R_r ) ) -smallest $ \u2026 \u201d $ R_r $ does NOT cause different sparsity between training and inference time . $ R_r $ is the rate denoting how much we trust the pruning result from runtime pruning and $ 1-R_r $ is about how much we trust from static pruning . $ R_r \\in [ 0,1 ] $ is a hyperparameter which will be fixed during training and inference . $ M_O $ is not the final pruning result , instead , it is the overlap/interset of $ M_r $ and $ M_s $ . The final pruning result is $ M $ in Eq.5.Since the DRL agents have same behaviors in training and inference , and $ R_r $ is fixed , sparsity remains the same between training and inference time ."}}
