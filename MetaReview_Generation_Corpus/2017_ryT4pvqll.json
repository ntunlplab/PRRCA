The method essentially optimizes a weighted combination of expected reward (essentially the REINFORCE objective without an entropy regularizer) plus a term from the reward augmented maximum likelihood objective (from a recent NIPS paper), and show that the resulting update can be made with a fairly small modification to the REINFORCE algorithm. The authors show improved performance on several sequential \"program-like\" domains like copying a string, adding, etc.\n \n I'm recommending this paper for acceptance, as I think the contribution here is a good one, and the basic approach very nicely offers a better exploration policy than the typical Boltzmann policy, using a fairly trivial modification to REINFORCE. But after re-reading I'm less enthusiastic, simply because the delta over previous work (namely the RAML paper) doesn't seem incredibly substantial. None of the domains in the experiments seem substantially challenges, and the fact that it can improve over REINFORCE isn't necessarily amazing.\n \n Pros:\n + Well-motivated (and simple) modification to REINFORCE to get better exploration\n + Demonstrably better performance with seemingly less hyperparameter tunies\n \n Cons:\n - Delta over RAML work isn't that clear, essentially is just a weighted combination between REINFORCE and RAML (though in RL context)\n - Experiments are good, but not outstanding relative to simple baselines", "reviews": [{"review_id": "ryT4pvqll-0", "review_text": "This paper proposes a novel exploration strategy that promotes exploration of under-appreciated reward regions.

Below are our responses : - It is not very clear what is the main motivation of the paper\u2026 Authors should make it clear which is the main motivation It is true that we had two primary motivations : first , to introduce an RL algorithm that improves the performance and the exploration behavior of the commonly used policy gradient ; and second , to improve the behavior of RL algorithms on program induction .

This suggests that there is a linear relationship between trajectory rewards and their log-probability which can be exploited by measuring the resulting mismatch. That is, when an action sequence under-appreciates its reward, its log-probability is increased. This method is a simple modification to the well-known REINFORCE method, requiring only one extra hyperparameter \\tau, and intuitively provides us with a better exploration mechanism than \\epsilon-greedy or random exploration. The method is tested on algorithmic environments, and compared to entropy-regularized REINFORCE and double Q-learning, and performs equally or better than those two baselines, especially in more complex environments. remarks: - the focus in the introduction on algorithmic tasks may be a double-edged sword. It is an interesting domain to test your hypothesis and benchmark your method. At the same time, it distracts the reader from the (IMO) generality of the proposed method. - in the introduction you say the reward is sparse, in section 6, on tasks 1-5, you then say there is a reward at each correct emission, i.e. each time step. This is only 'corrected' to end-of-episode-reward in section 7.4, after having discussed results. I'd move or mention this in section 6. - approach seems quite sensible to tau being in the same range as logpi(a|h), but you only try tau=0.1 for UREX. I'm not sure I understand nor agree with this experimentation choice. - an alternative to grid search is random search (Bergstra&Bengio, 2012). It may illustrate better hyperparameter robustness, and allow you to explore more in the same number of experiment. opinion: - An interesting approach to policy-gradient, to be sure. It tackles the very important question of \"how should agents explore?\" - I'm ambivalent to claiming that an algorithm is robust to hyperparmeters simply because it performs better on the selected hyperparameter range. All you really show is that it performs well some amount of time when the hyperparams lay in that range. Couldn't it be that MENT needs different hyperparameters? (Just being devil's advocate here) - I see why matching 1/tau with logpi is the obvious choice, but it implies a very strong prior: that the reward (to a factor of 1/tau) lies in the same space as the log policy. One point of failure I see (but correct me if I'm wrong) is that as the length of the trajectory grows the reward is expected to grow linearly, so short ways to get some reward will be less explored than long ways of getting the same reward, creating an imbalance unless the reward is shaped such that shorter trajectories get more reward (which is only the case in task 6). - It might have been good to also compare with methods explicitly trying to explore better with value-functions (e.g. prioritized experience replay, Schaul et al 2015) - At the risk of repeating myself, tau plays a major role in this method, but there is little analysis on its effect on experiments. The methodology and reasoning is clearly explained and I think this paper communicates its message very well. That message is novel, albeit a minor modification to a well-known algorithm, it is well motivated and, I think, a welcome addition to literature concerning exploration in RL. The experiments are chosen accordingly, and results seem to reflect the hypothesis of the authors. I realize the tyranny of extensive experimentation and the scarcity of time, but I do think that this paper would benefit from more (or cleverer) experimentation, as well as demonstrating more explicitly the impact of the method on exploration. Reading this paper convinced me that measuring mismatch between a trajectory's observed reward and its probability given the current policy is a clever (and well motivated) thing to do. Yet, I think that the paper could have a more convincing empirical argument, even if it is for toy tasks.", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "reply_text": "Thank you for your thoughtful review . Below are our responses : - the focus in the introduction on algorithmic tasks may be a double-edged sword\u2026 . It is true that we had two motivations , and the proposed policy gradient modification is far more general than just being applicable to algorithm induction . However , we think algorithm induction is an important problem in its own right that also provides an excellent test-bed for research on exploration issues , since , as mentioned above , it greatly diminishes the role of perception and motor control ( which can quickly overwhelm development and experimentation ) . We will revise the introduction to make these considerations clearer and that the choice of algorithmic tasks is not necessary to the success of the algorithm . We have also included an additional bandit task in the appendix . - in the introduction you say the reward is sparse\u2026 . I 'd move or mention this in section 6 . Good point . We will mention this in section 6 , as suggested . - approach seems quite sensible to tau being in the same range as logpi ( a|h ) , but you only try tau=0.1 for UREX . I 'm not sure I understand nor agree with this experimentation choice . We found that tau=0.1 worked well for UREX across the entire range of our experiments . Such a fixed choice can only put UREX at a comparative disadvantage , yet it still allowed UREX to produce better results in our experiments . We do not assert that this value of tau is always suitable - some experimentation is always needed in principle . Clearly , tau must change if the rewards are scaled by some constant for example . - an alternative to grid search is random search ( Bergstra & Bengio , 2012 ) .... Given that we only modified at most three hyper-parameters , we found it feasible and more appropriate to do a full grid search . - I 'm ambivalent to claiming that an algorithm is robust to hyperparmeters simply because it performs better on the selected hyperparameter range .... Could n't it be that MENT needs different hyperparameters ? Of course proving robustness to hyperparameters is challenging , but we selected the range of hyperparameters after experiments with several algorithms and tasks . Generally , hyperparameters outside the selected range performed poorly for all of the techniques . We were surprised to see that UREX performs well on a larger subset of hyperparameters compared to the baselines , and we reported the behavior in the paper . We believe this indicates more robustness for the current tasks , but more experiments could be beneficial . - I see why matching 1/tau with logpi is the obvious choice , but it implies a very strong prior : that the reward ( to a factor of 1/tau ) lies in the same space as the log policy . One point of failure ... Yes , our formulation assumes that two action sequences with the same reward should have the same probability in the optimal policy . If under the current model , a short sequence is more probable than a longer sequence with equal reward , then the gradient updates would push the policy to put more probability mass on the longer sequence which is aligned with our assumption . Indeed , we do not see this as a failure case . In some tasks , it may be intrinsically better to prefer a shorter sequence , all else being equal , which should be reflected in the reward function . - It might have been good to also compare with methods explicitly trying to explore better with value-functions\u2026 . While this would be interesting , we focused on policy methods and double Q-learning . - \u2026 tau plays a major role in this method , but there is little analysis on its effect on experiments . While we observed that choosing a good value of tau is important , we found the same value of tau to work reasonably well across all of the tasks . We leave more experimentation for a more thorough analysis to future work . - I think that the paper could have a more convincing empirical argument , even if it is for toy tasks . For more results , we have revised the paper to include an appendix with a simple bandit-like task with a very large action space . Do you have particular empirical statistics in mind to help showcase the effectiveness of comparing reward and log probability under the policy ? - I do think that this paper would benefit from more ( or cleverer ) experimentation , as well as demonstrating more explicitly the impact of the method on exploration . We have considered quantitatively measuring an algorithm \u2019 s \u201c exploration \u201d , but it is hard to know what to measure as a proxy to quantify an algorithm \u2019 s exploration behavior . For example , if our proxy is entropy of the policy distribution , then entropy regularization would be rated highly under that measurement . The objective measurement we came up with is whether an algorithm can solve a task that is hard for other algorithms . Accordingly , our experiments show that UREX performs better than the alternatives , and we associate this performance edge to better exploration ."}, {"review_id": "ryT4pvqll-2", "review_text": "The paper proposes a new algorithm based on REINFORCE which aims at exploring under-appreciate action sequences.
