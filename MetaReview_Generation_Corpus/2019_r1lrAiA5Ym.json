Building on the recent paper on differentiable plasticity, the authors propose a learnt, neuro-modulated differentiable plasticity that can be trained with gradient descent but is more flexible than fixed plasticity. The paper is clearly motivated and written, and the tasks are constructed to validate the method by demonstrating clear cases where non-modulated plasticity fails completely but where the proposed approach succeeds. On a large, general language modeling task (PTB) there is a small but consistent improvement over LSTMS. The reviewers were very split on this submission, with two reviewers focusing on the lack of large improvements on large benchmarks, and the other reviewer focusing on the novelty and success of the method on simple tasks. The AC tends to side with the positive review because of the following observations: the method is novel and potentially will have long term impact on the field, the language modeling task seems like a poor fit to demonstrate the advantages of the dynamic plasticity, so focusing on that benchmark overly much is misleading, and the paper is high-quality and interesting to the community.

It extends previous research on differentiable Hebbian plasticity by introducing a neuromodulatory term to help gate information into the Hebbian synapse. The neuromodulatory term is placed under network control, allowing it to be time varying (and hence to be sensitive to the input, for example). Another variant proposes updating the Hebbian synapse with modulated exponential average of the Hebbian product. This average is linked to the notion of an eligibility trace, and ties into some recent biological work that shows the role of dopamine in retroactively modulating synaptic plasticity. Overall the work is nicely motivated and clearly presented. There are some interesting ties to biological work -- in particular, to retroactive plasticity phenomena. There should be sufficient details for a reader to implement this model, thought there are some minor details missing regarding the experimental setup, which will be addressed below. The authors test their model on three tasks: cue-award association, maze learning, and Penn Treebank (PTB). In the cue-award association task the retroactive and simple modulation networks perform well, while the non-modulated and non-plastics fail. For the maze navigation task the modulated networks perform better than the non-modulated networks, though the effect is less pronounced. Finally, on PTB the authors report improvements over baseline LSTMs. One of the main claims of this paper is that neuromodulated plastic LSTMs...outperform standard LSTMs on a benchmark language modeling task\u201d, and that therefore \u201cdifferentiable neuromodulation of plasticity offers a powerful new framework for training neural networks\u201d. This claim is unfortunately unfounded for a very important reason: the LSTM performance is not at all close to that which can be achieved by LSTMs in general. The authors cite such models in the appendix (Melor et al), but claim that \u201cmuch larger models\u201d are needed, potentially with other mechanisms, such as dropout. Though this may be true, these models still undermine the claim that \u201cneuromodulated plastic LSTMs...outperform standard LSTMs on a benchmark language modeling task\u201d. This claim is simply not true, and more care is needed in reporting the results here in the wider context of the literature. Also, I am left wondering what are considered the parameters of the models -- are only the neuromodulatory terms considered as the additional trainable parameters compared to baseline LSTMs? How are the Hebbian synapses themselves considered in this calculation? If the Hebbian synapses are not considered, then the authors need a control with matched memory-capacities to account for the extra capacity afforded by the Hebbian synapses. Given the ties between Hebbian synapses and attention (see Ba et al), an important control here could be an LSTM with Bahdanau (2014) style attention. Finally, the style (font) of the paper does not adhere to the ICLR style template, and must be changed. Overall, the ideas presented in the paper are intriguing, and further research down this line is encouraged.

This is merely a convenient choice to make the task more challenging . Re : `` Why does Experiment 1 present pairs of stimuli , rather than high-dimensional individual stimuli ?

Non-target cues operate as distractors and having pairs of stimuli shown before each response increases the uncertainty in reward credit assignment ( i.e.when receiving a reward , the network must still find out which of the two stimuli is the target ) .

We will keep trying to investigate such massive architectures in the future . Re : `` Why were zero-sequences necessary in Experiment 1 ? [ ... ] Perhaps the authors could clarify on what a confounding `` time-locked scheduling strategy '' would look like in this task ? '' The random zero-inputs make the timing of the cues unpredictable , forcing the network to be driven specifically by the stimuli - as opposed to learning a pre-programmed strategy at each given time step . This is merely a convenient choice to make the task more challenging . Re : `` Why does Experiment 1 present pairs of stimuli , rather than high-dimensional individual stimuli ? '' Again , this simply makes the task more challenging . Non-target cues operate as distractors and having pairs of stimuli shown before each response increases the uncertainty in reward credit assignment ( i.e.when receiving a reward , the network must still find out which of the two stimuli is the target ) . To better describe the task , we have added a schema of an episode to Figure 1 . We hope this may facilitate understanding . Re : `` Why is non-plastic rnn left out of Figure 2b ? '' As documented in Miconi et al 2018 , non-plastic networks are terrible at this task . We are happy to run this experiment and include it if the reviewer finds it useful . Typos : `` However , in Nature , '' -- no caps in appendix : `` ( see Figure A.4 ) '' -- the figure is labeled `` Figure 3 '' '' We thank the reviewer for noticing these typos and have fixed them in the text ."}}
