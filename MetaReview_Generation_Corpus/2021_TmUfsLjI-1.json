The paper is well written and easy to follow . Experiments using 46 pretrained models and 19 downstream tasks show the effectiveness of the hybrid strategy in selecting the right model for transfer learning with low computational complexity . Overall , I vote for rejecting the paper as the paper has very limited novelty and experiments are not convincing . In particular , I fail to find the major contributions of the paper except the empirical study on VTAB dataset . While papers related to empirical study are interesting and worth of acceptance , this paper does not provide any major insight that could be useful for the future research on transfer learning .

How is the current method comparable to Leep : A new measure to evaluate transferability of learned representations ? Experiments and analysis should be included in the experiments to verify the effectiveness of the hybrid strategy . How does the size of representation/feature affect the final performance ? Does the conclusion still hold with different size of features ? How does amount of data in the target task affects the performance of ranking ? What is the effect of number of pretrained models on the ranking ? Mutual information between the features and discrete labels of the downstream task can be used to rank different models for transfer learning . How does the proposed hybrid strategy related to mutual information based ranking strategy ? Experimental comparison should be included in the paper to verify this . Does the ranking strategy and analysis presented in the paper limited to only classification models ? In particular , can models trained using self supervised learning where there is no classification head , be used as pre-trained models in the current approach ? How does the analysis change while considering self-supervised models which are now-a-days quite popular in representation learning ?

Both proxy tasks that we analyzed * * require only a forward pass * * ( inference ) through the pre-trained networks in order to get the representations * Training a large network ( or fine-tuning it ) robustly with early stopping for mischosen hyperparameters or initialization parameters is an open research problem * Fine-tuning requires additional knowledge about the architecture ( e.g. , knowing when the batch norm layers are used ) of the networks , which a typical user would not be able to grasp for all the pre-trained embeddings . For our proxy task , * * no such knowledge is required * * until fine-tuning the winning models"}, "3": {"review_id": "TmUfsLjI-1-3", "review_text": "This paper presents a large scale empirical study on pretrained model selection for transfer learning and show that a hybrid approach that combines task-agnostic and task-aware methods outperforms the existing approaches on VTAB benchmark . The paper is well written and easy to follow . Experiments using 46 pretrained models and 19 downstream tasks show the effectiveness of the hybrid strategy in selecting the right model for transfer learning with low computational complexity . Overall , I vote for rejecting the paper as the paper has very limited novelty and experiments are not convincing . In particular , I fail to find the major contributions of the paper except the empirical study on VTAB dataset . While papers related to empirical study are interesting and worth of acceptance , this paper does not provide any major insight that could be useful for the future research on transfer learning . Furthermore , many experiments and comparisons are missing which should be included in the paper for a better understanding of the empirical study . How is the proposed hybrid ranking strategy comparable to the model selection approaches presented in Duality Diagram Similarity : a generic framework for initialization selection in task transfer learning , ECCV 2020 ; DEPARA : Deep Attribution Graph for Deep Knowledge Transferability , CVPR 2020 . These papers should be clearly discussed with possible comparisons in the experiments to show the advantage of the hybrid approach . Comparison with many simple baselines are missing in the paper . E.g. , How does the hybrid strategy comparable to fine-tuning with early stopping . Can we select pre-trained models by finetuning for only few epochs ? How does the number of epoch affect the final performance while comparing to the hybrid strategy ? How is the current method comparable to Leep : A new measure to evaluate transferability of learned representations ? Experiments and analysis should be included in the experiments to verify the effectiveness of the hybrid strategy . How does the size of representation/feature affect the final performance ? Does the conclusion still hold with different size of features ? How does amount of data in the target task affects the performance of ranking ? What is the effect of number of pretrained models on the ranking ? Mutual information between the features and discrete labels of the downstream task can be used to rank different models for transfer learning . How does the proposed hybrid strategy related to mutual information based ranking strategy ? Experimental comparison should be included in the paper to verify this . Does the ranking strategy and analysis presented in the paper limited to only classification models ? In particular , can models trained using self supervised learning where there is no classification head , be used as pre-trained models in the current approach ? How does the analysis change while considering self-supervised models which are now-a-days quite popular in representation learning ? What about considering discriminators of generative models , e.g. , VAE or BigGAN in the transfer learning analysis ? More experiments and analysis should be performed in the experiments .", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "We thank the reviewer for the thoughtful comments and pointing out the potentially relevant related work . We have updated the main body of the paper , in particular the `` Background '' section and the `` Other related work '' section to improve the positioning of our work , and added Figure 2 for further clarification . That being said , we believe that our contributions are relevant to the research community and the practitioners . [ Contributions ] * * Hybrid approach * * is not the main and only contribution , but a byproduct of a careful large scale analysis of current available model search strategies . [ Not limited to classification ] The proposed method is * * not limited to models pre-trained with classification heads , even though we focus only on classification tasks . * * Note that VAE and BIGGAN-based models are included ( Table 3 of the Appendix ) . [ Related methods ] We thank the reviewer for helping us place the work into the more broad research context ! While these methods are indeed related in the general sense , they are * * not directly comparable to our method : * * Duality diagram similarity ( DDS ) and DEPARA : - * * We can use any model * * , whereas Taskonomy is restricted to models trained on the same input with different labels . - * * We examine fine-tuning * * , whereas for both methods the encoder part which is transferred is not fine-tuned . - The methods aim at computing the results of the Taskonomy dataset faster by only working on a subset of the dataset ( the same data for all models ) . - Adapting DEPARA and DDS to learn some dependency between tasks or models similarly to Task2Vec or Model2Vec would make it a \u201c meta-learned task-aware \u201d strategy , on which we elaborate in the revisited paper . - While Task2Vec and Model2Vec are directly applicable by ranking models based on their similarity in the embedding space , it 's unclear how to apply the model search on new tasks using DDS or DEPARA ( or taskonomy in general ) without semantic relations between the upstream and downstream tasks and without training a new network from scratch . LEEP : - By including the VTAB models , * * we have access to models pre-trained with different loss functions , fully unsupervised to semi-supervised and strongly supervised * * , whilst LEEP is only applicable to models pre-trained for classification tasks - LEEP provides theoretical guarantees only for fixed features , even though fine-tuning outperforms the linear classifier in their work . - Linear correlation is not necessarily transitive , which is why LEEP can not be used directly to derive the relationship between fine-tuning and linear classifier . Hence , we * * go one step further than LEEP * * in understanding this behaviour . [ Other suggestions ] Early stopping : - Training a network robustly with early stopping is an open research problem - Fine-tuning requires additional knowledge about the architecture ( e.g. , knowing when the batch norm layers are used ) . For our proxy task , * * no such knowledge is required * * . Impact of the dimension : - Already shown in Appendix for Pool * * _DIM2048_ * * . The results for this model pool are * * consistent * * with the pool * * _RESNET-50_ * * in the main body of the paper and were hence relegated to supplementary material . Mutual Information ( MI ) based approaches : - MI could be useful , but there is no clear understanding on how to correctly estimate the MI and its relation to transferability . We are hopeful that , together with the thoroughly revised Section 2 , we addressed the major concerns ."}}
