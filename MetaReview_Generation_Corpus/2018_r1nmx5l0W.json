It appears to be a stochastic RNN with skip connections (so it's conditioned on the last two states rather than last one) trained by an adversarial objective (which is no small feat to make work for sequential tasks) with results shown on the firetruck category of the QuickDraw dataset. Yet the authors claim significantly more importance for the work than I think it merits. First, there is nothing variational about their variational RNN. They seem to use the term to be equivalent to \"stochastic\", \"probabilistic\" or \"noisy\" rather than having anything to do with optimizing a variational bound. To strike the right balance between pretension and accuracy, I would suggest substituting the word \"stochastic\" everywhere \"variational\" is used. Second, there is nothing self-improving or collaborative about their self-improving collaborative GAN. Once the architecture is chosen to share the weights between the weak and strong generator, the only difference between the two is that the weak generator has greater noise at the output. In this sense the architecture should really be seen as a single model with different noise levels at alternating steps. In this sense, I am not entirely clear on what the difference is between the SIC-GAN and their noisy GAN baseline - presumably the only difference is that the noisy GAN is conditioned on a single timestep instead of two at a time? The claim that these models are somehow \"self-improving\" baffles me as well - all machine learning models are self-improving, that is the point of learning. The authors make a comparison to AlphaGo Zero's use of self-play, but here the weak and strong generators are on the same side of the game, and because there are no game rules provided beyond \"reproduce the training set\", there is no possibility of discovery beyond what is human-provided, contrary to the authors' claim. Third, the total absence of mathematical notation made it hard in places to follow exactly what the models were doing. While there are plenty of papers explaining the GAN framework to a novice, at least some clear description of the baseline architectures would be appreciated (for instance, a clearer explanation of how the SIC-GAN differs from the noisy GAN). Also the description of the soft $\\ell_1$ loss (which the authors call the \"1-loss\" for some reason) would benefit from a clearer mathematical exposition. Fourth, the experiments seem too focused on the firetruck category of the QuickDraw dataset. As it was the only example shown, it's difficult to evaluate their claim that this is a general method for improving variety without sacrificing quality. Their chosen metrics for variety and detail are somewhat subjective, as they depend on the fact that some categories in the QuickDraw dataset resemble firetrucks in the fine detail while others resemble firetrucks in outline. This is not a generalizable metric. Human evaluation of the relative quality and variety would likely suffice. Lastly, the entire section on the strong-weak collaborative GAN seems to add nothing. They describe an entire training regiment for the model, yet never provide any actual experimental results using that model, so the entire section seems only to motivate the SIC-GAN which, again, seems like a fairly ordinary architectural extension to GANs with RNN generators. The results presented on QuickDraw do seem nice, and to the best of my knowledge it is the first (or at least best) applications of GANs to QuickDraw - if they refocused the paper on GAN architectures for sketching and provided more generalizable metrics of quality and variety it could be made into a good paper.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "We thank the reviewer for constructive comments . Following is our reply : Q : Once the architecture is chosen to share the weights between the weak and strong generator , ... it appears to be a stochastic RNN with skip connections ( so it 's conditioned on the last two states rather than last one ) trained by an adversarial objective ... A : We are sorry for not describing the \u201c tying \u201d precisely . It is done in a soft manner ; that is , we add a loss term for the weak generator that require its parameters to be similar to those of the strong generator . Please see Section 4 for more details . Actually , the extra input taken by the strong generator is not necessary and are not implemented . We just described it for the cases when the hyperparameter of the term is high . We have remove the irrelevant sentences to avoid confusion . Q : I am not entirely clear on what the difference is between the SIC-GAN and their noisy GAN baseline ... A : The noisy GAN just weakens the ordinary RNN generator of the naive GAN to achieve the \u201c covering \u201d effect similar to that of the strong-weak collaborative GAN\u2014if a point is made bad , the RNN may learn to generate better points at later time steps in order to fool the discriminator . However , the \u201c next points \u201d in the weakened RNN are made bad too ( since the entire RNN is weakened ) and may not be able to actually cover the previous point . To fool the discriminator in such a situation , the RNN may instead learn to output points that , after being weakened , are more easily \u201c covered \u201d by the future ( bad ) points . In effect , this makes the RNN conservative to generating novel sequence and reduces variety . We call this the covering-or-covered paradox . On the other hand , once trained , the strong generator in the strong-weak collaborative GAN is used to generate an entire sequence . This means that the strong generator should have enough based temperature ( or noise level ) to ensure the variety . One naive way to do so is to add a base-temperature to both the strong and weak generators during the training time . However , the strong generator faces the covering-or-covered paradox now and may learn to be conservative . We can instead train the strong-weak collaborative GAN multiple times using a self-improving technique . We start by adding a low base-temperature to both the strong and weak generators and train them in the first phase . Then we set the weak generator in the next phase as the strong one we get from the previous phase and train the generators with increased base-temperature . We then repeat this process until the target base-temperature is reached . We call the process \u201c self-improving \u201d because the strong generator in the next phase learns to cover itself in the previous phase . It is important to note that in a later phase , the weak generator is capable of covering the negative effect due to the variety of the strong generator ( because that weak generator is a strong generator in the previous phase ) . So , the strong generator in the current phase can focus on the \u201c covering \u201d rather than \u201c covered , \u201d preventing the final RNN from being conservative . Q : ... because there are no game rules provided beyond \u201c reproduce the training set , \u201d there is no possibility of discovery beyond what is human-provided , contrary to the authors ' claim .
