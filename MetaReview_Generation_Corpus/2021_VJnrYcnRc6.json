The reviews are generally positive: they praise the generality of the method, the extensive experimental evaluation, and the good empirical results. Overall, no major concerns were raised, and all reviewers recommend acceptance.\n\nA couple of concerns remain, in my view:\n- The method is generally heuristic, and intuitively rather than theoretically motivated. This is compensated of course by the empirical evaluation, which is thorough.\n- The paper could be better written. The reviewers suggested some minor improvements which were implemented in the updated version, but I believe there is room for further improvement.\n\nDue to the above concerns, I consider the rating of reviewer #3 (10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper) to be unjustifiably high. On balance, however, I'm happy to recommend acceptance.\n\nMessage to the authors:\n\nIn the abstract you write: \"a simple generic model that can beat highly engineered pipelines\". Please be aware that the word \"beat\" evokes competition, winners and losers, so it's not appropriate in the context of scientific evaluation.

A detailed comparison summary along with VAE , Normalizing flows and some other related works is now added to App . 1.To summarise , in VAEs , the posterior distribution is typically sampled from the family of Gaussians . However , assuming the posterior distribution of the latent space as a Gaussian distribution can constrain the quality of the generated data distribution , as the true distribution may be far from a Gaussian ( note that recent work such as [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] have been proposed to address this ) . In contrast , we do not explicitly model our latent space as a probability distribution . However , we can draw some interesting analogies from a probabilistic perspective as follows : our latent space $ \\zeta $ can be interpreted as a set of energy surfaces $ E_ { x_j } : \\zeta \\rightarrow \\mathbb { R } $ , as $ E_ { x_j } = || { y^g_ { j } - G ( x , z_ { j } ) } || $ for each ground truth mode $ y^g_ { j } $ . From this perspective , Fig.~21 in the appendix illustrates the energy heatmaps for the toy example . As shown , high energies are indicated by a brighter color . Since our system has a finite energy , the combined energy $ E_x = \\sum_j E_ { x_j } $ can be transformed to a probability distribution via the Gibbs measure as $ p ' ( z ) = \\frac { 1 } { T ( \\beta ) } \\exp ( -\\beta E_x ( z ) ) $ , where $ T ( \\cdot ) $ is the partition function.This probability is not restricted to a Gaussian , as opposed to VAEs . Another critical difference between the VAEs and our model is that we do not sample directly from $ p ' ( z ) $ , since to obtain $ p ' ( z ) $ , we need to integrate $ E_x $ over the latent space . However , our predictor network $ \\mathcal { Z } $ learns the high probability coordinates $ \\ { z^ * } $ of $ p ' ( z ) $ , and is able to converge to such locations at inference . This probabilistic perspective of our latent space is intuitively justified by the convergence samples shown in Fig.41 in appendix . The intermediate samples we obtain as we go from $ z $ to $ z^ * $ also produce plausible results , however , the visual quality at the $ z^ * $ is maximized , indicating high $ p ' ( z =z^ * |x ) $ . Therefore , our model does not explicitly learns the probability distributions , rather the predictor network learns to converge to the high probability areas in complex distributions .

We believe that this can be one of the reasons our model outperforms other models that use the adversarial loss . * * Comment : The authors can consider comparing and contrasting with the normalizing flow related work . * * Thank you for bringing our attention to this . We have now briefly mentioned Normalizing flows in Sec.1 and a more detailed explanation ( along with VAEs ) in App . 1 * * Comment : It would be good to have a short section clearly compare the model size/capacity of your models and the counterpart models * * We have now added this comparison to the paper . The # flops of the models are as follows for a batch size of 10 . | Model |Flops ( $ 1 \\times 10^ { 9 } $ ) | |-|-| |CE | ` 0.634 | |PN ` | ` 0.946 | |Chroma |1.275| |CIC |52.839 ` | |P2P | 0.723 ` | |Izuka |14.082 ` | |RFR |25.64 ` | |Ours | ` 0.638 | * * Comment : Also , is it good to move at least one model architecture you used to main text ? * * We have now moved model architecture for 128 input size to the main text ."}}
