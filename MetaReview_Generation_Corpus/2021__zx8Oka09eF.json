Reviewer concerns have been well addressed by the authors in their rebuttal and updated version of the paper.", "reviews": [{"review_id": "_zx8Oka09eF-0", "review_text": "Summary : This paper analyzed the influence of neural network width on the network performances while fixing the total number of parameters . Specifically , the authors introduced several ways to change the model width without increasing the number of parameters , and showed experimentally that for widened networks with a random static mask on weights to keep the number of parameters , increasing the width can improve the performances of the models until the network become very sparse and hard to train . They author theoretically showed that for a not so sparse one-hidden-layer neural network , increasing width decreases the distance to the Gaussian Process kernel corresponding to the infinith-width limit , which partially supports their experimental findings . Pros : 1.Understanding the reason behind the generalization performance of neural networks is a very important problem , and the idea of decoupling the effects of network width and the number of parameters on the generalization performance is interesting . 2.This paper is clearly written , well organized , and generally easy to understand . The figures in this paper are clear , and each figure was explained in detail . The methods/experimental settings are explained in detail , and the reasons why the authors use these models/methods are also discussed in the paper . The relationship to prior works has been clearly discussed . 3.The experimental methodologies and theoretical computations appear to be correct . Cons : 1.The justification for this specific problem analyzed in this paper , i.e. , fixing the number of parameters and changing the width , is a bit unclear . The number of parameters can be interpreted as a measure for the expressive power of the model , but this is not a very direct relationship because the expressive power is also related to other factors , e.g. , the depth , the width , the choice and ordering of the layers . In the methods proposed in this paper , the authors were either changing the explicit number of parameters ( e.g. , linear bottlenetwork ) or changing the expressive power of the network , which included other ( perhaps unwanted ) factors in this framework and could potentially influence the results . Details will be discussed in the next point . 2.The definition of `` number of parameters '' is a bit unclear in this paper , making the problem that the authors want to analyze a bit vague . The authors did n't formally define it , but it is actually one of the core concept in this paper . The authors used three similar terms , i.e. , `` number of parameters '' / '' number of tunable parameters '' , `` effective number of parameters '' , and `` expressive power '' , in this paper . However , these three terms have slightly different meanings , and none of them is defined in this paper . From my understanding , `` expressive power '' is the set of all functions that can be reprensented by a model , and `` number of parameters '' / '' number of tunable parameters '' is a simple parameter count and can be used as a complexity measure of the expressive power , but `` effective number of parameters '' is kind of confusing . For instance , putting a low-rank constraint in Linear Bottleneck or using a sparse model actually changes the expressive power of the neural network but ( claimed by this paper ) does not change the `` effective number of parameters '' . Due to the lack of formal definition of these three terms , I think the problem analyzed by this paper is not clear enough , making the points made in this paper unclear . 3.The authors are explaining some of the experimental results in a very intuitive way without enough supporting evidence . For example , the authors said that Linear Bottleneck suffers from some `` implicit bias '' , deleting weights from a sparse layer make optimization `` more difficult '' , and small connectivity can hurt the `` trainability '' of the model . These terms are not formally defined or explained in detail , making the points made by the authors a little vague . 4.The connection between the theory and experiments in this paper is a bit weak . People have observed that the performances of commonly-used neural networks always outperform their infinith-width limit , i.e. , the corresponding infinith-width NTK . Therefore , in practical neural network models , simply decreasing the distance to the infinith-width limit may hurt the performance . Thus , I suspect that the explanation provided by the authors only works for some particular examples like small networks on MNIST . Recommendation : Overall , I vote for rejecting this paper . Although the idea of decoupling the influence of width and number of parameters is interesting , the problem analyzed in this paper is vague and a lot of terms used in this paper is not properly defined , making the arguments in this paper unclear . Supporting arguments for recommendation : See `` Cons '' . Questions for the authors : 1 . Please address the cons mentioned above . 2.For the experiments , I wonder whether you have done enough fine-tuning for the hyperparameters of each model and used the best test accuracy . Also , have you run each experiment multiple times or only once ? 3.I did n't understand why you do not consider the linear/non-linear bottleneck as an effective method . I think the goal is to analyze the effect of width but not to get a significant improvement on the test accuracy . Minor comments : 1 . Typo : Page 5 , `` MLP '' , paragraph 3 , `` This results '' - > `` This result '' 2 . Page 5 , paragraph 1 , which model is `` the model with baseline width 8 '' ? Is it the model with the number of parameters 1.8e+5 ?", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "Thank you for your valuable comments which indeed helped us improve the paper by removing vague terms and arguments . Your review suggests that our main idea is important and interesting , our paper is well-written , and our experimental methodologies and theoretical computations are correct . However , your main concern seems to be that some of the terms/discussions in the paper are vague . Below , we explain how we have addressed your concern to the best of our ability . However , we want to emphasize that this problem has a complex nature which makes it difficult to obtain a definitive solution . It is impossible to run a completely controlled experiment which allows one to fix # param and change the width while controlling everything else in the architecture and optimization setup . Any empirically chosen modification would lead to changing other factors , many of which are not well-understood , hence making clear arguments difficult . We believe that in our analysis we have done the best possible to isolate and study the effect of interest . We hope that you will consider accepting the paper given the complex nature of this problem , our clear contributions , and our modifications to address your concerns . Re the problem studied in this paper : Even though the number of parameters is only an indirect measure of the expressive power of a model , we chose it because the number of parameters has been widely used in papers related to understanding over-parameterization and generalization . In fact , in many theoretical papers , either width or number of parameters appear in the bounds . Therefore , we wanted to disentangle these two factors . Re the definition of terms : Thanks for pointing this out . We apologize for the confusion caused by our choice of terms . The usage of \u201c effective number of parameters \u201d and \u201c number of tunable parameters \u201d was not necessary , and we have removed them from the text . We have also defined the term \u201c expressive power \u201d to avoid confusion . Re explaining results in an intuitive way : Thank you for pointing this out . We have clarified these explanations in the revised version , avoiding making intuitive claims without supporting evidence . Re connection between theory and experiment : We accept the criticism . Our theoretical analysis can provide an explanation for the observed effect for networks that are close to the NTK regime . Networks used in practice are trained outside of this regime , not only because of their finite width but also because of other hyperparameter choices ( large learning rates , weight decay , etc . ) . However , it is often true in deep learning that one can develop theoretical understanding only in a limited setting , and we believe that such understanding can still be valuable in the long term . Re question 2 -- Hyperparameter tuning and random seeds : We have fine-tuned the parameters for the baseline models , and kept them fixed for the widened models , which allowed us to avoid 10x more experiments . This makes any claim about improvements over baseline credible , since the chosen hyperparameters are optimized for the baseline . We did repeat each experiment with multiple random seeds whenever feasible and reported the averages . For MNIST experiments , we used 10 seeds . For CIFAR and SVHN , we averaged over 3 random seeds , except for the largest model size . The standard deviation is small , such that in most cases the error bars are of the size of the plot markers . For reference , we have included a plot with error bars in the Appendix ( Section E , Figure 11 ) . Re question 3 -- Why not consider linear/non-linear bottleneck : To be clear , in the paper we do consider all three methods , and in the first stage of our study we analyze and compare them . We believe that the answer to the question of decoupling width and number of parameters is this : \u201c it \u2019 s complicated \u201d . We do our best to highlight the differences between each of these methods , and the factors that are being changed by choosing any one of them . Finally , we proceed to show that performance can be improved by increasing the width without changing the number of model parameters . Since sparsity is the most promising method based on empirical performance ( test accuracy given a certain width ) , we continue our investigation further on sparsity ."}, {"review_id": "_zx8Oka09eF-1", "review_text": "In this paper , the authors analyze the enhancements brought by widening networks with the number of parameters fixed .
