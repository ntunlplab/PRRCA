Some tasks may also require more dimensions than others and the explicit separation prevents the model from discovering and exploiting this.

Similarly (and as acknowledged by the authors), the strategy of separating key and value functionality has been proposed before, but not in the context of natural language modeling.

The results in this paper are important because they show that learning long-term dependencies is not a solved problem by any means. The authors provide a very nice comparison to prior results and the fact that their n-gram RNN is often at least competitive with far more complicated approaches is a clear indication that some of those methods may not capture as much context information as previously thought.
