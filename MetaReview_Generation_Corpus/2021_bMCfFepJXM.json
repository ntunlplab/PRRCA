Namely , the authors propose using an analytical bound on the action KL to reduce variance , a state-dependent Lagrange multiplier ( output by a neural network ) , an extra entropy term , and a mask on the Q-value updates for KL-constraint violating actions . The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques on a subset of the D4RL datasets , where they compare favorably on some tasks . Ablations demonstrate the benefit of each technique on a subset of tasks . * * Strong Points * * : The writing is clear , presenting each of the improvements well . For the most part , these improvements are also technically correct , or at least fairly well motivated . Experiments demonstrate that these techniques generally improve the performance of BRAC on the D4RL datasets . D4RL is a recent standardized dataset for offline RL , and results are reported using 4 random seeds , which is generally considered reasonable . Thus , this experimental support appears to be rigorous . The reported results are also competitive with other model-free and model-based offline RL approaches . In addition , the authors also perform ablation experiments to investigate each of the proposed improvements , generally demonstrating improved stability and final performance . The approach is likely to be reproducible , considering that BRAC is a fairly straightforward framework and the proposed improvements are not incredibly complex . The authors provide network architectures and training details in the appendix . However , in practice , many RL algorithms are prone to small , important implementation details . Releasing code would help to further improve reproducibility . Although none of the improvements , on their own , are particularly novel , their combination appears to provide important practical advances for BRAC . These seemingly small improvements can make a significant difference in practice , e.g.SAC is substantially worse without the ensemble of Q-networks ( from TD3 ) . * * Weak Points * * : As mentioned above , this paper is not substantially novel ; it proposes a few practical improvements for an existing framework/algorithm in an existing area ( offline RL ) . While practical improvements are still worthwhile , this does place a greater requirement for either improved empirical performance or new insights into issues with existing algorithms ( e.g.the TD3 paper ) . Empirical performance improvements are demonstrated , however , most improvements appear to be on the hopper environment . It should also be noted that 3/4 of the ablation experiments are on the hopper environment as well . In other environments , the results ( Table 1 ) are mixed . While the results are encouraging , I do not seem them as being in favor of BRAC+ across the board . Instead , I could see future researchers incorporating the new techniques into other offline RL approaches , e.g.BEAR+ , MOPO+ , etc . As such , the issues with previous works and the improvements from these techniques should be clearly described and demonstrated . While the authors do present ablation experiments for their techniques , the reader is left to infer that the performance improvement is due to the reasons given by the authors . This paper would be more convincing and impactful if these issues were shown directly , giving readers insight into the issues with existing methods . For instance , instead of reporting performance from different KL evaluation techniques , the authors could report the empirical variance of each technique , as well as the bias incurred by their bound . Another weak point of this paper pertains to the experiment details / comparison . The authors appear to have implemented the basic BRAC framework along with their proposed improvements . The results for other methods in Table 1 are from Fu et al. , 2020 and other recent papers . However , it \u2019 s unclear if these implementations are comparable . For instance , BEAR typically uses a larger ensemble of Q-networks , whereas the authors report using 2 networks . While these results can be useful for benchmarking across the field , they do not necessarily give insights to readers . I would have preferred to see the authors implement their improvements across multiple previously proposed offline RL algorithms ( both model-free and model-based ) to enable a more direct comparison and evaluation . * * Accept / Reject * * : I would lean slightly toward acceptance for this paper . The authors present several techniques for improving offline RL algorithms within the BRAC framework . These practical improvements are often overlooked , but they can have an outsized impact on the community . This is inline with papers like Flow++ , TD3 , etc . However , as mentioned above , there are aspects of this paper that could be substantially improved . Currently , the paper does not demonstrate clear insight into the issues that are being fixed ; this is only shown through improved performance . Likewise , the experiments could be improved to provide a more direct comparison and evaluation of these techniques ( see above ) . * * Questions * * : The TD loss for Q-network training in Algorithm 1 appears to be missing the action KL / entropy at the next step . Was this a purposeful decision ? How much does pre-training help or hurt ? This is presented , but performance is not compared in the experiments section . * * Additional Feedback * * : Introduction : I wouldn \u2019 t necessarily say that BRAC was \u201c proposed \u201d in Wu et al. , 2019 . While they did coin the term BRAC , this is built around previous works , e.g.BCQ , BEAR , etc . This is part of a larger class of relative-entropy policy search algorithms . Background : MDP acronym is given twice . Improving Behavior Regularized Offline Reinforcement Learning : There \u2019 s a connection between the optimal Lagrange multiplier ( or \u201c temperature \u201d ) and uncertainty in the Q-value estimate ( see Fox , 2019 : toward provable unbiased temporal-difference value estimation ) . This should probably be discussed . \u201c requires large samples to reduce \u201d \u2014 > \u201c requires a large number of samples to reduce \u201d \u201c variational inference model \u201d \u2014 > \u201c latent variable model \u201d \u201c can be estimated analytically \u201d : but this really only applies in special cases , e.g.Gaussian.Should explain why the behavior policy is not just one Gaussian . I found the entropy regularization paragraph difficult to follow . Related Work : There \u2019 s another related paper by Agarwal et al. , 2019 ( arXiv:1907.04543 ) . Experiments : \u201c regularizor \u201d \u2014 > \u201c regularizer \u201d Unclear what is interesting/new in the performance vs. KL threshold section .", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "reply_text": "1.Our code will be published on github once the decision comes out . 2.To increase the novelty , we propose to use gradient penalized policy evaluation to avoid OOD actions . We also include more discussions and insights of the existing approach by comparing KL vs. MMD regularization . In addition , we comment on the behavior-regularized approach itself . 3.Our finished experiments using the newly proposed technique on single-modal datasets show competitive results against CQL . We will update the paper as more results come out . 4.Due to space limitation , we will include a variance of various regularization methods in the Appendix in the following revision . Theoretically , the bias is the KL divergence between the true posterior distribution and the variational distribution . We are unsure how to compute the bias of the upper bound since the true posterior distribution is unknown . 5.We added a comparison between MMD with Laplacian kernel and KL-based regularization . To make fair comparison , we only substitute KL with MMD with additional MMD-specific hyper-parameter tuning . The details are in Appendix D. We don \u2019 t know how many gradient steps of the BEAR algorithm needs to be run to achieve the performance reported in D4RL paper . For example , if our approach stops at 300 gradient steps ( 150 epoch ) , the performance of our implementation of BEAR ( differences are summarized in Appendix D ) outperforms the performance reported in the D4RL benchmark in all the three tasks in the ablation study . But in general , we observe that the performance by running the BEAR algorithm deteriorates over time . Such an observation is also reported in the CQL paper . 6.The action/KL regularization is not included in the Q update . Including the term leads to a different MDP with reward function : r \u2019 ( s , a ) =r ( s , a ) -\\alpha KL ( pi , pi_b ) . ( The derivation can be found in the SAC paper ( https : //arxiv.org/abs/1801.01290 ) Appendix B . Without the term , it is the same MDP with state-wise regularization . We notice that the MMD term is not included in the Q update in the BEAR implementation and thus we follow them . 7.We will fix various presentation issues as you suggested in the next revision ."}, {"review_id": "bMCfFepJXM-2", "review_text": "This paper proposes two major improvements over BRAC to address the key challenge of offline RL : out-of-distribution action sampling . The first improvement is to replace the sample-based divergence calculation with an analytical upper-bound estimation . The second improvement is to use a state-dependent weight for divergence regularization , which is learned automatically via dual gradient descent . In addition , several small and practical enhancements are proposed . The method is evaluated on simulation benchmarks and demonstrates performance gains over several state-of-the-art baselines , especially on multi-modal datasets . The paper addresses an important research direction : offline RL , which is crucial in the field where data collection is difficult and data is scarce . The paper is clearly written . Although the method is improvements of an existing approach ( BRAC ) , the improvements are non trivial , novel , and show promising results . I have three minor questions and suggestions : 1 ) Intuitively , I think that KL divergence between policies might not be the best measure to prevent OOD action samples . The regularization of BRAC ( ++ ) is to minimize the KL divergence between the current policy and the behavior policy . The KL divergence only cares about the `` closeness '' between the policies , and totally ignores the actual density of ( s , a ) in the dataset . For example , although \\pi_\\beta ( s , a ) can have a high probability , which allows the \\pi_\\theta to sample action a frequently on state s , depending on how the behavior policy is sampled to create the dataset , the state s might not be visited often , and thus has a low density in the dataset . 2 ) BRAC++ has less improvement on single-modal datasets . However , it is these single-modal datasets that improvements are more desired . In multi-modal datasets , a good policy already exists and is used to collect the dataset . So the use of offline RL in multi-modal datasets is not well motivated despite its better performance . To improve the paper quality , I suggest that more analysis and discussions about why BRAC++ did not work well on single-modal datasets are included . 3 ) In the ablation study ( Figure 1 ) , I suggest that the paper adds more curves from different tasks so that it is clear that the observations and conclusions in ablation study are general across different tasks . If page limit is a concern , it is OK to add additional figures in the supplementary material . Despite my minor concerns , I still think that this is a strong paper that advances the field of offline RL . Thus , I recommend accepting this paper .", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "reply_text": "1.We agree with you that behavior regularization itself is not sufficient to fully avoid OOD actions and state distribution should also be considered . We added a discussion in Section 6 . Due to the time limit , this will be left as a future direction . 2.With gradient-penalized policy evaluation , the performance of our approach on the single-modal datasets improves as suggested by finished experiments . We will keep updating our paper as more experiments finish . 3.We added more ablation study figures , discussions and insights ."}, {"review_id": "bMCfFepJXM-3", "review_text": "This paper introduces several enhancements of BRAC ( Behavior Regularized Actor Critic ) , an approach for offline reinforcement learning . The original idea of BRAC is to add a divergence term between behavior distribution , which was used to collect data , and training policy . In the original paper , this is implemented by fitting behavior policy with a density model and then using this density model to estimate a divergence between these distribution . This paper proposes to improve this approach in several ways : first , authors propose to increase the expressiveness of the behavior policy density model by using a mixture of Gaussian distributions ; second , authors propose to adaptively tune the weight of the KL term by learning a state-dependent Lagrange multiplier ; finally , authors add an additional entropy term , supervised pre-training and out-of-distribution action masking for target Q . In overall , this paper introduces a simple and well motivated set of enhancements . The paper is well written and easy to follow . The approach is evaluated on a subset of tasks from a widely used benchmark for offline RL , D4RL . The approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art methods and outperforms the original BRAC and CQL , a recent state-of-the-art approach , on several tasks . It is very impressive that such a simple set of enhancements provides significant performance gains . I like the paper but I have several concerns regarding the significance of the contribution and some experimental details : 1 ) although the approach demonstrates impressive results , the novelty is incremental ; 2 ) the approach improves BRAC by moving from a single Gaussian distribution to a mixture of distributions . How sensitive is the approach is the choice of a number of mixture components ? 3 ) table 3 raises some concerns regarding generality of the approach since some of the crucial hyper-parameters are task-specific ; 4 ) each ablation in figure 1 is performed on a single task that raises concerns regarding generality of the conclusions . At the moment , this is a borderline paper . However , if the aforementioned concerns are properly addressed , I will reconsider my rating . I looking forward to authors ' response .", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "1.We replaced the q-masking with gradient penalized policy evaluation , which we think is more novel . It leads to better performance on both single-modal and multi-modal datasets as suggested by the new ablation study . More results will be reported in the following revision . 2.In our later studies , we actually found that using GMM as the decoder distribution in a VAE doesn \u2019 t actually improve the performance , but it increases the complexity . BEAR learns the behavior policy as a $ \\beta $ -VAE ( with more focus on the reconstruction term than the KL term ) with MSE reconstruction loss . Minimizing the MSE reconstruction loss is equivalent to maximizing the log probability of a Gaussian distribution with fixed variance as the decoder output . However , the variational lower bound does not hold in $ \\beta $ -VAE that breaks our derivation . In this paper , we learn the behavior policy as a regular VAE . The decoder outputs a Gaussian distribution with input-conditioned mean and variance . 3.It is true that the hyper-parameter is task specific . In MOPO ( https : //arxiv.org/abs/2005.13239 ) , the parameter is also task specific . This is actually reasonable for various reasons : - The entropy of the behavior policy matters since the entropy of the learned policy must be smaller than the behavior policy . This leads to task-specific entropy regularization terms . - The modality of the dataset matters . In a single-modal dataset , we typically set a lower threshold than that in a multi-modal daset for the same environment . This is because the density of the behavior policy in a single-modal dataset is typically lower than that in a multi-modal daset . This leads to task-specific KL threshold terms 6 .

The first improvement is to replace the sample-based divergence calculation with an analytical upper-bound estimation . The second improvement is to use a state-dependent weight for divergence regularization , which is learned automatically via dual gradient descent . In addition , several small and practical enhancements are proposed . The method is evaluated on simulation benchmarks and demonstrates performance gains over several state-of-the-art baselines , especially on multi-modal datasets . The paper addresses an important research direction : offline RL , which is crucial in the field where data collection is difficult and data is scarce . The paper is clearly written . Although the method is improvements of an existing approach ( BRAC ) , the improvements are non trivial , novel , and show promising results . I have three minor questions and suggestions : 1 ) Intuitively , I think that KL divergence between policies might not be the best measure to prevent OOD action samples . The regularization of BRAC ( ++ ) is to minimize the KL divergence between the current policy and the behavior policy . The KL divergence only cares about the `` closeness '' between the policies , and totally ignores the actual density of ( s , a ) in the dataset . For example , although \\pi_\\beta ( s , a ) can have a high probability , which allows the \\pi_\\theta to sample action a frequently on state s , depending on how the behavior policy is sampled to create the dataset , the state s might not be visited often , and thus has a low density in the dataset . 2 ) BRAC++ has less improvement on single-modal datasets . However , it is these single-modal datasets that improvements are more desired . In multi-modal datasets , a good policy already exists and is used to collect the dataset . So the use of offline RL in multi-modal datasets is not well motivated despite its better performance . To improve the paper quality , I suggest that more analysis and discussions about why BRAC++ did not work well on single-modal datasets are included . 3 ) In the ablation study ( Figure 1 ) , I suggest that the paper adds more curves from different tasks so that it is clear that the observations and conclusions in ablation study are general across different tasks . If page limit is a concern , it is OK to add additional figures in the supplementary material . Despite my minor concerns , I still think that this is a strong paper that advances the field of offline RL . Thus , I recommend accepting this paper .", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "reply_text": "1.We agree with you that behavior regularization itself is not sufficient to fully avoid OOD actions and state distribution should also be considered . We added a discussion in Section 6 . Due to the time limit , this will be left as a future direction . 2.With gradient-penalized policy evaluation , the performance of our approach on the single-modal datasets improves as suggested by finished experiments . We will keep updating our paper as more experiments finish . 3.We added more ablation study figures , discussions and insights ."}, "3": {"review_id": "bMCfFepJXM-3", "review_text": "This paper introduces several enhancements of BRAC ( Behavior Regularized Actor Critic ) , an approach for offline reinforcement learning . The original idea of BRAC is to add a divergence term between behavior distribution , which was used to collect data , and training policy . In the original paper , this is implemented by fitting behavior policy with a density model and then using this density model to estimate a divergence between these distribution . This paper proposes to improve this approach in several ways : first , authors propose to increase the expressiveness of the behavior policy density model by using a mixture of Gaussian distributions ; second , authors propose to adaptively tune the weight of the KL term by learning a state-dependent Lagrange multiplier ; finally , authors add an additional entropy term , supervised pre-training and out-of-distribution action masking for target Q . In overall , this paper introduces a simple and well motivated set of enhancements . The paper is well written and easy to follow . The approach is evaluated on a subset of tasks from a widely used benchmark for offline RL , D4RL . The approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art methods and outperforms the original BRAC and CQL , a recent state-of-the-art approach , on several tasks . It is very impressive that such a simple set of enhancements provides significant performance gains . I like the paper but I have several concerns regarding the significance of the contribution and some experimental details : 1 ) although the approach demonstrates impressive results , the novelty is incremental ; 2 ) the approach improves BRAC by moving from a single Gaussian distribution to a mixture of distributions . How sensitive is the approach is the choice of a number of mixture components ? 3 ) table 3 raises some concerns regarding generality of the approach since some of the crucial hyper-parameters are task-specific ; 4 ) each ablation in figure 1 is performed on a single task that raises concerns regarding generality of the conclusions . At the moment , this is a borderline paper . However , if the aforementioned concerns are properly addressed , I will reconsider my rating . I looking forward to authors ' response .", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "1.We replaced the q-masking with gradient penalized policy evaluation , which we think is more novel . It leads to better performance on both single-modal and multi-modal datasets as suggested by the new ablation study . More results will be reported in the following revision . 2.In our later studies , we actually found that using GMM as the decoder distribution in a VAE doesn \u2019 t actually improve the performance , but it increases the complexity . BEAR learns the behavior policy as a $ \\beta $ -VAE ( with more focus on the reconstruction term than the KL term ) with MSE reconstruction loss . Minimizing the MSE reconstruction loss is equivalent to maximizing the log probability of a Gaussian distribution with fixed variance as the decoder output . However , the variational lower bound does not hold in $ \\beta $ -VAE that breaks our derivation . In this paper , we learn the behavior policy as a regular VAE . The decoder outputs a Gaussian distribution with input-conditioned mean and variance . 3.It is true that the hyper-parameter is task specific . In MOPO ( https : //arxiv.org/abs/2005.13239 ) , the parameter is also task specific . This is actually reasonable for various reasons : - The entropy of the behavior policy matters since the entropy of the learned policy must be smaller than the behavior policy . This leads to task-specific entropy regularization terms . - The modality of the dataset matters . In a single-modal dataset , we typically set a lower threshold than that in a multi-modal daset for the same environment . This is because the density of the behavior policy in a single-modal dataset is typically lower than that in a multi-modal daset . This leads to task-specific KL threshold terms 6 . We re-did all the ablation studies ."}}
