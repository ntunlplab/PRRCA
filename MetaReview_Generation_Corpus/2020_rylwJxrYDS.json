The result is a fairly complex approach, with not too much novelty but with a good amount of engineering and analysis, and ultimately very good performance.  The reviewers agree that the work deserves publication at ICLR, and the authors have addressed some of the reviewer concerns in their revision.  The complexity of the approach may mean that it is not immediately widely adopted by others, but it is a good proof of concept and may well inspire other related work.

Discrete representations are fine-tuned by using these as input to a BERT model; the resulting representations are then used instead of conventional speech features as the input to speech recognition models. New state-of-the-art results are achieved on two datasets. Strengths: The core strength of this paper is in the results that are achieved on standard speech recognition benchmarks. The results indicate that, while discritization in itself does not give improvements, coupling this with the BERT-objective results in speech features which are better in downstream speech recognition than standard features. I think the main technical novelty is in combining discritization with future time step prediction (but see the weakness below). Weaknesses: The main weakness of the paper is that it does not situate itself within existing literature in this area. Over the last few years, researchers in the speech community have invested significant effort in learning better speech representations, and this is not discussed. See e.g. [1]. Even more importantly, very recently there has been a number of papers investigating discrete representations of speech; see the review [2]. Some of these papers specifically use VQ-VAEs [3]. [4] actually compares VQ-VAE and the Gumbel-Softmax approach. These studies should be mentioned. This paper is different in that it incorporates future time step prediction. But context prediction has also been considered before, also for speech [5, 6, 7]. This paper can be situated as a new contribution combining these two strands of research. In the longer run it would be extremely beneficial to the community if this approach is applied to the standard benchmarks as set out in [2]. As a minor weakness, some parts of the paper is not described in enough detail and the motivation is weak or not exactly clear (see detailed comments below). Overall assessment: I think the results as well as the new combination of existing approaches in the paper warrants publication. But it should be amended significantly to situate itself within the existing literature. I therefore award a \"weak accept\". Detailed questions and suggestions: - Section 1: As motivation for this work, it is stated that \"we aim to make well performing NLP algorithms more widely applicable\". As noted above, some NLP-like ideas (such as prediction of future speech segments, stemming from text-based language modelling) have already been considered within the speech community. Rather than motivating the work in this way, it might be helpful to focus the contribution as a combination of future time step prediction and discretization (both of which have been considered in previous work, but not in combination). - Section 4: Would it be possible to train the vq-wav2vec model jointly with BERT, i.e. as one model? I suspect it would be difficult since, for the masking objective, the discrete units are already required, but maybe there is a scheme where this could work. - Section 2.2: Similarly to the above question, would there be a way to incorporate the BERT principles directly into an end-to-end model, e.g. by randomly masking some of the continuous input speech? - Section 3.3: What exactly does \"mode collapse\" refer to in this context? Would this be using only one codebook entry, for instance? - Section 6: It seems that in all cases to obtain improvements from discritization, BERT is required on top of the vq-wav2vec discrete symbols. Is it possible that the output acoustic model is simply better-matched to continuous rather than discrete input (direct vq-wav2vec gives discrete while BERT gives continuous)? Would it make sense to train the wav2vec acoustic model on top of the vqvae codebook entries (e) instead of directly on the symbols?

While I understand that vector quantization makes the use of NLP-style BERT-training possible (as the inputs to NLP models are discrete tokens), there are potential disadvantages as well. One observation from the submission is that the token set may need to very large (from tens of thousands to millions) for the system to work well, making the BERT training computationally expensive (I noticed that the BERT model is trained on 128 GPUs). Also, without BERT pre-training, using directly the discrete tokens seems to consistently give worse performance for ASR. I think some more motivations or explorations (what kind of information did BERT learn) are needed to understand why that is the case. 2. Besides the computational expensive-ness of the three-step approach (vector quantization, BERT, acoustic model training), the combined model complexity is large because these steps do not share neural network architecture. A more economical approach is to use BERT-trained model as initialization for acoustic model training, which is the classical way how RBMs pre-training were used in ASR. 3. One concern I have with discrete representation is how robust they are wrt different dataset. The ASR datasets used in this work are relatively clean (but there does exists domain difference between them). It remains to see how the method performs with more acoustically-challenging speech data, and how universally useful the learned features are (as is the case for BERT in NLP). 4.
