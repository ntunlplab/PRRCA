It seems to be inconsistent with the notation N in Section 3.1 . 3 ) This paper introduces a learnable spatial mask matrix W_ { mask } , but how to use it is not clear . 4 ) Does Figure2 ( c ) in page 5 mean Figure 2 ( b ) ? 5 ) In the last equation of page 5 ( for computing Y_ { s_out } ) , what is t ? Moreover , since W_F is of shape F by 1 and W_t is t by M , how can we multiply W_F by W_t ? 6 ) How to obtain Y_ { m_out } in equation 7 ? 7 ) Many typos and grammatical errors .

STG2Seq , Laplqaacian- > Laplacian , which needed - > which is needed , we conjecture the reason is- > we conjecture that\u2026 . Technical : 1 ) Novelty of the proposed model is limited . The proposed spatio-temporal joint graph convolution is very similar to the concept of 3D GCN [ 1 ] . However , in this paper , I could not see any discussion about the difference and comparison between them . 2 ) In section 3.1 , this paper assumes that the graph is undirected . However , the propagation of traffic in spatio-temporal domains are certainly directed ( e.g. , downstream , upstream ) . 3 ) What is the difference between the temporal attention in Section 3.4 and an FFN ( two fully-connected ( FC ) layers ) ? In my view , this paper only uses two matrices for the dimension transformation , which is the same as two FC layers . Experiments : 1 ) It is more reasonable to compare the proposed model with CNN-based solutions in the Mobile traffic dataset , as there is no explicit graph structure ( only Euclidean structure exists ) . Baselines like ST-ResNet , ConvLSTM , DeepSTN+ or DeepLGR should be included for comparison . 2 ) According to the paper , I can not see any detail of the multi-run experiments ( e.g. , in Table 1 and Figure 3 ) . How about the stability ( i.e. , variance ) of the proposed method ? 3 ) The experiment shows little improvement to the existing approaches in the first two datasets . There should be significant test ( e.g. , student t-test ) conducted to make sure the experimental result is reliable . Considering the limited improvement , it is also questionable whether adding such complexity to the model is worthy . It may not make sense to improve the MAE by 0.02 in the first dataset by increasing the runtime a lot . 4 ) No experiments to show the effects of the spatio-temporal kernels . Why should we set it 3x1 , 1x3 and so on ? 5 ) It seems that the MAPE in Table 1 largely exceeds 100 % , which is unusual to see . What is the unit of MAPE here ? Minor issues : 1 ) All acronyms should be expanded for the first time in text ( e.g. , HA is not expanded.What is HA ? Historical average ? ) . 2 ) There should be one space before each citation . For example , DCRNN ( Li et al. , 2017 ) - > DCRNN ( Li et al. , 2017 ) . 3 ) In the first paragraph of Section 1 , the paper claims that \u201c Typical applications include \u2026 , traffic road condition forecast ( \u2026 , Liang et al. , 2018 ) , \u2026 and geo-sensory time series prediction ( Li et al. , 2017 ) . \u201d However , Liang et al. , 2018 is for geo-sensory time series modeling while Li et al. , 2017 is for traffic prediction . Please carefully read these papers before citing them . 4 ) It is difficult for those who are not familiar with the Inception Network to understand how your model draws insights from it . In addition , the paper proposing the Inception Network should be cited . 5 ) No future work discussed in this paper . In summary , I recommend not to accept this paper in its present form .

The model uses a convolutional block to model the spatial-temporal correlations and an inception attention based module to capture the graph heterogeneity . They evaluate the proposed method on three different traffic prediction datasets . Pros : 1.The problem of traffic prediction is important . Cons : 1.The contributions are limited in this paper . The ideas of jointly model spatial-temporal information via convolutional layer ( see 3D GNN to model irregular regions [ 1 ] and 3D CNN to model regular regions [ 2 ] ) , and multi-scale spatial-temporal modeling ( see [ 3 , 4 ] ) are not new . These papers have been released for more than one year . Especially , the multi-scale motivations in [ 3 ] [ 4 ] are almost the same in the paper . The only difference is that this paper involves attention to weight different scales , which is also a very common practice . Thus , I think the contributions are not enough to be accepted by top machine learning conference . 2.The experiments could be improved . - Besides the ablation studies in this paper ( add modules to the base model ) , it would be more convincing to add the ablation studies by removing some components . Since only combining one module ( results in Table 2 ) performs worse than AGCRN , removing some components and keep the rest could provide deeper analysis . In addition , it would be more convincing to conduct all the ablation studies on all three datasets . - To support the claim of region heterogeneity , it would be more interesting to show some case studies to verify the motivation and see the reasons for the improvement . Otherwise , the improvement may come from the increasing of the number of parameters . - It would be better to show the error bar for each result since the improvement in some datasets is limited ( e.g. , PeMS04 ) . 3.Some figures could be improved .

Empirical results on multiple real-world datasets shows promising results . The draft seems to be written in a rush , with mistake/typos in paragraphs , figures and tables . Besides , the some of the major claims are not well supported by the empirical results . Here are details about the main concerns : D1 : Some major claims are not well supported by the experimental results . - The main novelty of this paper the is the spatial temporal joint convolution . Yet , its design needs more theoretical and empirically justifications . The idea of the concatenating K order of Laplacian matrix is a bit ad-hoc lacking of theoretical justification . Besides , the spatial temporal joint graph convolution is not necessary `` more joint '' than baseline algorithm like DCRNN which incorporates the graph convolution operation into the each sub-step of the RNN operation . - Besides , the claimed convolution in the spectral domain is actually operations in the spatial domain since the final form of the convolution is essentially a polynomial of the Laplacian matrix without involved the transformation into the spectral domain . - Limited ablation studies are conducted to show its effectiveness . There are some ablation study in Table 2 , but not enough to well support the claims . For example , what is performance gain by simplify replacing the graph convolution with the proposed spatial-temporal joint graph convolution ? Is inception style convolution is actually needed ? What is the different with and without it ? - Besides , as shown in Table 2 , even after the adding the spatiotemporal convolution and the inception attention mechanism , the performance is still worse than some baselines , including DCRNN and AGCRN . Potentially it is also possible that the mask ( which can be applied to other baselines ) actually contributes to the major improvement . D2 : Presentation . This paper seems to be written in a rush , and the presentation need more polish . - The technical part is a bit hard to follow . For example , when explaining the spatial-temporal joint convolution , it might be easier to understand if the author provides an additional figure about it , e.g. , a 2-D matrix with size T x K , with filters of size K_t and K_s applied on it , where graph convolution is used for the feature extraction . - Inconsistent name of the proposed model . The name of the proposed model is not consistent , for example it is called ASTI-GCN in abstract , while in Figure 2a it is called ATI-GCN . Yet , in Section 4 is is call ASTIGCN , and in Table 2 it is also called ours . - Errors/typos in table and paragraphs . For example , in Table 1 the RMAE should RMSE . The Laplqaacian in Section 3.2 should be Laplacian . - In Equation ( 8 ) , we may rewrite \\hat { Y } _i as \\hat { Y } ( \\Theta ) _i so the loss is a function of the parameter \\Theta . In Section 4.2 , we may Capitalize the first letter of alternative to make it consistent with the other three . Also remove the duplicate periods at the end of the sentence . - In Equation ( 2 ) , the T_k ( L ) probably represents the order k instead of order k-1 otherwise T_0 ( L ) will become order -1 . - The datasets use , i.e. , PeMS04 , PeMS08 , seems to be PeMSD4 and PeMSD8 , we may keep it consistent with previous methods to facilitate comparison of metrics in baseline papers . - In the Table 2 , it is mentioned that each setting has been run for 10 time , and it is helpful to also include the standard deviation to show the statistical significance of the improvement", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We truly appreciate your suggestions for our paper . With regard to your questions , below are some explanations : 1 . Why spatial temporal joint convolution ? Why not baseline algorithms like DCRNN ? This paper was really written in a rush , so there are some ideas we did not express fully . Spatial temporal joint convolution is actually designed to capture the directly spatial-temporal joint correlations described in introduction . Baseline algorithms like DCRNN , use the separated part to build the spatial and temporal correlations separately , which can not capture the directly spatial-temporal joint correlations in the scenes showed in Figure1 in our paper . 2. spatio or spectral domain ? It \u2019 s spectral domain . We use the undirected adjacency matrix . And the Laplacian matrix has been rescaled by the largest eigenvalue of . 3.Is inception style convolution is actually needed ? What is the different with and without it ? We use the inception for building the method to model heterogeneity . In more detail , we use the inception to capture different filed of receptive filed weights , combined with the graph node-level attention . Because we thought the heterogeneity behaves like different nodes are sensitive to different receptive fields . So this method actually can be called adaptive receptive fields spatial-temporal GCN . 4.Is the performance come from the mask ? The performance is not come from the mask . We did plenty of experiments and the data we provided is real . The mask did not contribute a lot when we use it alone . We should design the ablation experiments carefully and to well support our innovation ideas . The presentation has been modified according to your suggestions .

Besides , the spatial temporal joint graph convolution is not necessary `` more joint '' than baseline algorithm like DCRNN which incorporates the graph convolution operation into the each sub-step of the RNN operation . - Besides , the claimed convolution in the spectral domain is actually operations in the spatial domain since the final form of the convolution is essentially a polynomial of the Laplacian matrix without involved the transformation into the spectral domain . - Limited ablation studies are conducted to show its effectiveness . There are some ablation study in Table 2 , but not enough to well support the claims . For example , what is performance gain by simplify replacing the graph convolution with the proposed spatial-temporal joint graph convolution ? Is inception style convolution is actually needed ? What is the different with and without it ? - Besides , as shown in Table 2 , even after the adding the spatiotemporal convolution and the inception attention mechanism , the performance is still worse than some baselines , including DCRNN and AGCRN . Potentially it is also possible that the mask ( which can be applied to other baselines ) actually contributes to the major improvement . D2 : Presentation . This paper seems to be written in a rush , and the presentation need more polish . - The technical part is a bit hard to follow . For example , when explaining the spatial-temporal joint convolution , it might be easier to understand if the author provides an additional figure about it , e.g. , a 2-D matrix with size T x K , with filters of size K_t and K_s applied on it , where graph convolution is used for the feature extraction . - Inconsistent name of the proposed model . The name of the proposed model is not consistent , for example it is called ASTI-GCN in abstract , while in Figure 2a it is called ATI-GCN . Yet , in Section 4 is is call ASTIGCN , and in Table 2 it is also called ours . - Errors/typos in table and paragraphs . For example , in Table 1 the RMAE should RMSE . The Laplqaacian in Section 3.2 should be Laplacian . - In Equation ( 8 ) , we may rewrite \\hat { Y } _i as \\hat { Y } ( \\Theta ) _i so the loss is a function of the parameter \\Theta . In Section 4.2 , we may Capitalize the first letter of alternative to make it consistent with the other three . Also remove the duplicate periods at the end of the sentence . - In Equation ( 2 ) , the T_k ( L ) probably represents the order k instead of order k-1 otherwise T_0 ( L ) will become order -1 . - The datasets use , i.e. , PeMS04 , PeMS08 , seems to be PeMSD4 and PeMSD8 , we may keep it consistent with previous methods to facilitate comparison of metrics in baseline papers . - In the Table 2 , it is mentioned that each setting has been run for 10 time , and it is helpful to also include the standard deviation to show the statistical significance of the improvement", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "reply_text": "We truly appreciate your suggestions for our paper . With regard to your questions , below are some explanations : 1 . Why spatial temporal joint convolution ? Why not baseline algorithms like DCRNN ? This paper was really written in a rush , so there are some ideas we did not express fully . Spatial temporal joint convolution is actually designed to capture the directly spatial-temporal joint correlations described in introduction . Baseline algorithms like DCRNN , use the separated part to build the spatial and temporal correlations separately , which can not capture the directly spatial-temporal joint correlations in the scenes showed in Figure1 in our paper . 2. spatio or spectral domain ? It \u2019 s spectral domain . We use the undirected adjacency matrix . And the Laplacian matrix has been rescaled by the largest eigenvalue of . 3.Is inception style convolution is actually needed ? What is the different with and without it ? We use the inception for building the method to model heterogeneity . In more detail , we use the inception to capture different filed of receptive filed weights , combined with the graph node-level attention . Because we thought the heterogeneity behaves like different nodes are sensitive to different receptive fields . So this method actually can be called adaptive receptive fields spatial-temporal GCN . 4.Is the performance come from the mask ? The performance is not come from the mask . We did plenty of experiments and the data we provided is real . The mask did not contribute a lot when we use it alone . We should design the ablation experiments carefully and to well support our innovation ideas . The presentation has been modified according to your suggestions . Thank you so much for your guidance"}}
