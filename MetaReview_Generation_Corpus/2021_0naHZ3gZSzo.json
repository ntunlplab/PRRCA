Thank you for your rebuttal , I have read it and the other reviews . I agree with the other reviewers that some more baselines for high-dimensional benchmarks are required , and was not convinced by your rebuttal to those requests . I also think the aspect of non-convexity and local optima touched by Reviewer 4 warrants some discussion in the paper . I maintain my score of 4 . * * The paper presents a novel method for hyperparameter optimization based on zeroth order gradient estimation . The zeroth order estimation of the gradient permits the application of the method to complex architectures , provided that the hyperparameters are continuous and the objective function is Lipschitz continuous . The method appears competitive with both gradient-based HPO methods and gradient free methods on a suite of experiments with a number of hyperparameters ranging from 1 to 1250 . Strong points : - The method is simple and is competitive with previous gradient-free HPO methods for continuous hyperparameters . - The method appears better or competitive with previous gradient-based HPO work . - On the technical side the paper appears solid . I see no methodological flaws in the method . Weak points : - There is no comparison with gradient based methods for the deep network experiments ( arguably the most important benchmark ) . The authors state that the methods of Franceschi et al.could not be compared because they require smooth function , but checking their paper , they only mention a smooth optimization operator , and this condition appears to be met by a gradient descent optimization operator . Perhaps I am missing something here , but further justification on this point would be appreciated . - The description of the experiments is a bit lacking in certain regards . This diminishes the reproducibility of the work . For instance , the computational budget is not specified for the experiments . How long were benchmarks run for ? Was the budget specified in wallclock time ? How many function evaluations did each method complete ? Did you repeat each experiment and average them ? - The paper needs a lot of work on a clarity and quality standpoint . I spotted a lot of grammar mistakes and some sentences were hard to interpret . Recommendation : Given the current state of the paper , I would recommend rejection . The paper needs some serious copy-editing before it is up to the standards of a first tier conference such as ICLR . I should say that I like the method proposed in the paper , it would make a nice addition to the literature on HPO -- I just think it needs more polish . Apart from paper quality , more work/details on the following points/questions would help me increase my score for this paper : - The results are only presented using wallclock time . A general idea of the `` number of function evaluations '' achieved by each method would also be informative , a graphic comparing the performance with regards to function evaluations could be added in the appendix . This is an important point because some models take a long time to run , and whatever computation is done between function evaluations becomes meaningless in comparison . - What is the implication of removing the approximate gradient computation of HOAG with the zeroth order gradient proposed in this paper ? Is it still HOAG or does it become a new method ? - Figure 2. is a bit confusing to me . Why is the x-axis `` Inner epoch '' for the suboptimality figures ? Is this presenting the final optimization run with the best hyperparameters found ? Extra comments : Table 1 feels rather arbitrary , what is the threshold to say that a method is `` effective '' or not ? Simple or not ? Is BOHB really that simple compared to HOAG ? Complexity / optimization guarantees in terms of p and d might provide a clearer picture here ( those are generally available for GP-BO and most likely for gradient based methods ? ) -- just an idea . Section 2.1 : Claim that the number of hyperparameters in real problems would range from hundreds to thousands . It seems to me that problems with thousands of hyperparameters are very academic and never encountered in typical real world problems . Bring forward examples or please reformulate . Section 2.1 : I have mixed feelings about the last paragraph of this section titled Enlightenment with a cross symbol . Is this a religious reference ? I would argue this has no place in a scientific paper . Proofreading is required , examples of errors : Page 2. paragraph 2 : salable - > scalable Page 3 .

Zeroth-order optimization techniques use function evaluation only to approximate the gradients , thus they are applicable to black-box functions for which the gradient is difficult to compute . For hyperparameter tuning this is the case in general . Existing hypergradient-based methods are not applicable to generic tuning tasks , and have scalability issue . Existing generic methods such as Bayesian optimization have weak scalability in number of hyperparameters . I agree with these observations and the goal of having a flexible , efficient , effective , simple and scalable solution . While the idea of using zeroth-order optimization for HPO makes sense , the paper has not reached a sufficient depth in exploring this idea . The paper proposes to use ( Nesterov & Spokoiny 2017 ) without modification . There are several issues : ( 1 ) The paper concludes in page 5 that `` Because the A-based constrained optimization problem f ( $ \\lambda $ ) is continuous , we can use the zeroth-order hyper-gradient technique to optimize f ( $ \\lambda $ ) ( Nesterov & Spokoiny , 2017 ) . Nesterov & Spokoiny ( 2017 ) provided the convergence guarantee of zeroth-order hyper-gradient method when f ( $ \\lambda $ ) is Lipschitz continuous as defined in Definition 3 . '' With continuity only , the algorithm can converge to local stationary points . Straightforward application of the algorithm could violate the 'effectiveness ' and 'efficiency ' goal . The situation is worsened in the high-dim case when the variance of the gradient approximation is large . The experiment in Sec 3.3 supports this concern , where HOZOG underperforms REV in the long run . ( 2 ) The algorithm still has several hyperparameters to tune , including q , $ \\lambda $ and $ \\mu $ . From the experiments reported in the paper , each task uses different values of q , $ \\lambda $ and $ \\mu $ . That raises the question about the practicability , especially , if one needs to tune these hyperparameters , whether it can still be efficient , scalable and simple . The paper has not discussed how to tune them for a given task . The procedure of tuning is required to be discussed because 'flexibility ' is indeed a goal of this paper . ( 3 ) The same question can be asked about how the initial point of hyperparameters is chosen , and the paper does not discuss that . In addition to these issues , the paper makes a strong claim `` for high-dimensional hyperparameter optimization problems which have no customized RFHO algorithm , HOZOG currently is the only choice for this kind of problems to the best of our knowledge .

A view of algorithms for optimization without derivatives . Mathematics Today-Bulletin of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications , 43 ( 5 ) :170\u2013174 , 2007 . Since the paper emphasizes the importance of HOZOG in the high-dim scenario , some of these stronger baselines need to used . A final comment is that the phrase 'automated learning algorithm ' in the title is not very informative , especially as the selection of hyperparameters of HOZOG is not automated .", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "reply_text": "Thanks a lot for pointing out the related references of other methods designed for high-dimensional problems .

Did you repeat each experiment and average them ? - The paper needs a lot of work on a clarity and quality standpoint . I spotted a lot of grammar mistakes and some sentences were hard to interpret . Recommendation : Given the current state of the paper , I would recommend rejection . The paper needs some serious copy-editing before it is up to the standards of a first tier conference such as ICLR . I should say that I like the method proposed in the paper , it would make a nice addition to the literature on HPO -- I just think it needs more polish . Apart from paper quality , more work/details on the following points/questions would help me increase my score for this paper : - The results are only presented using wallclock time . A general idea of the `` number of function evaluations '' achieved by each method would also be informative , a graphic comparing the performance with regards to function evaluations could be added in the appendix . This is an important point because some models take a long time to run , and whatever computation is done between function evaluations becomes meaningless in comparison . - What is the implication of removing the approximate gradient computation of HOAG with the zeroth order gradient proposed in this paper ? Is it still HOAG or does it become a new method ? - Figure 2. is a bit confusing to me . Why is the x-axis `` Inner epoch '' for the suboptimality figures ? Is this presenting the final optimization run with the best hyperparameters found ? Extra comments : Table 1 feels rather arbitrary , what is the threshold to say that a method is `` effective '' or not ? Simple or not ? Is BOHB really that simple compared to HOAG ? Complexity / optimization guarantees in terms of p and d might provide a clearer picture here ( those are generally available for GP-BO and most likely for gradient based methods ? ) -- just an idea . Section 2.1 : Claim that the number of hyperparameters in real problems would range from hundreds to thousands . It seems to me that problems with thousands of hyperparameters are very academic and never encountered in typical real world problems . Bring forward examples or please reformulate . Section 2.1 : I have mixed feelings about the last paragraph of this section titled Enlightenment with a cross symbol . Is this a religious reference ? I would argue this has no place in a scientific paper . Proofreading is required , examples of errors : Page 2. paragraph 2 : salable - > scalable Page 3 . ( such as the deep neural network ) - > ( such as A deep neural network ) Multiple times in the text : hyperparmeters - > hyperparAmeters", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "reply_text": "Thanks a lot for your precious time to review our paper . I give the response to the main comments as following . 1.The reason we do not compare with gradient based methods for the deep network experiments is that\u0010 the code of gradient based methods can not be directly used to solve the hyperparameters optimization problems of deep network in our paper , due to that it is NOT a black box algorithm , it needs a customized design for a specific problem . 2.Actually we have provided many details of our experiments in Section 3 and Table 2 . We will try our best to provide more details of the experiments in the final version . In the experiments , we do not have computational budget . Actually , it is an interesting suggestion , we will try to provide experimental results within a given computational budget . 3.We will try to improve the presentation of this paper ."}, "3": {"review_id": "0naHZ3gZSzo-3", "review_text": "This work proposes to apply zeroth-order optimization to hyperparameter tuning . Zeroth-order optimization techniques use function evaluation only to approximate the gradients , thus they are applicable to black-box functions for which the gradient is difficult to compute . For hyperparameter tuning this is the case in general . Existing hypergradient-based methods are not applicable to generic tuning tasks , and have scalability issue . Existing generic methods such as Bayesian optimization have weak scalability in number of hyperparameters . I agree with these observations and the goal of having a flexible , efficient , effective , simple and scalable solution . While the idea of using zeroth-order optimization for HPO makes sense , the paper has not reached a sufficient depth in exploring this idea . The paper proposes to use ( Nesterov & Spokoiny 2017 ) without modification . There are several issues : ( 1 ) The paper concludes in page 5 that `` Because the A-based constrained optimization problem f ( $ \\lambda $ ) is continuous , we can use the zeroth-order hyper-gradient technique to optimize f ( $ \\lambda $ ) ( Nesterov & Spokoiny , 2017 ) . Nesterov & Spokoiny ( 2017 ) provided the convergence guarantee of zeroth-order hyper-gradient method when f ( $ \\lambda $ ) is Lipschitz continuous as defined in Definition 3 . '' With continuity only , the algorithm can converge to local stationary points . Straightforward application of the algorithm could violate the 'effectiveness ' and 'efficiency ' goal . The situation is worsened in the high-dim case when the variance of the gradient approximation is large . The experiment in Sec 3.3 supports this concern , where HOZOG underperforms REV in the long run . ( 2 ) The algorithm still has several hyperparameters to tune , including q , $ \\lambda $ and $ \\mu $ . From the experiments reported in the paper , each task uses different values of q , $ \\lambda $ and $ \\mu $ . That raises the question about the practicability , especially , if one needs to tune these hyperparameters , whether it can still be efficient , scalable and simple . The paper has not discussed how to tune them for a given task . The procedure of tuning is required to be discussed because 'flexibility ' is indeed a goal of this paper . ( 3 ) The same question can be asked about how the initial point of hyperparameters is chosen , and the paper does not discuss that . In addition to these issues , the paper makes a strong claim `` for high-dimensional hyperparameter optimization problems which have no customized RFHO algorithm , HOZOG currently is the only choice for this kind of problems to the best of our knowledge . '' in the end of Sec 3.4 . For example , there are other methods designed for high-dimensional problems : David Eriksson et al. , Scalable Global Optimization via Local Bayesian Optimization , NeurIPS'19 . N. Hansen . The CMA evolution strategy : A comparing review . In Towards a New Evolutionary Computation , pages 75\u2013102 . Springer , 2006 . M. J. Powell . A view of algorithms for optimization without derivatives . Mathematics Today-Bulletin of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications , 43 ( 5 ) :170\u2013174 , 2007 . Since the paper emphasizes the importance of HOZOG in the high-dim scenario , some of these stronger baselines need to used . A final comment is that the phrase 'automated learning algorithm ' in the title is not very informative , especially as the selection of hyperparameters of HOZOG is not automated .", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "reply_text": "Thanks a lot for pointing out the related references of other methods designed for high-dimensional problems . We did not provide the comparison to these algorithms due to the following reasons . 1 . [ David Eriksson et al.2019 ] uses trust region to improve the scalability of standard BO algorithm . Note that the same strategy of trust region can be used in our HOZOG algorithm to further improve the scalability of HOZOG . More generally , the most popular method of improving the scalability of Gaussian process based BO algorithm is low-dimensional embedding . However , same technique can also be used in our HOZOG algorithm . Thus , we only compare with standard BO algorithm for the purpose of fair comparison . 2.The CMA evolution strategy is also a zeroth order technique . Different to our HOZOG algorithm , it samples directions from a non-standard Gaussian distribution . We can also utilize this technique to produce more effective directions . In general , because our HOZOG is a gradient-based algorithm , HOZOG naturally can handle high-dimensional hyperparameters optimization problems which are different to different advanced BO algorithms that use the technique of low-dimensional embedding to improve the scalability of standard BO algorithms . However , if there does not exist such a low-dimensional space , this kind of improved BO optimization algorithms can not work for high-dimensional hyperparameters optimization problems , but we can ."}}
