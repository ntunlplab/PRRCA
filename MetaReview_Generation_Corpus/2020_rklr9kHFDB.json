Are the clusters still functionally distinct for varying thresholds ? Further why is MEI confusion matrix only shown for 13 groups ? The MEI confusion matrix is shown for a subset of the well predicted neurons ( with test correlation > = 0.7 ) , and some of the 17 groups shown in the cluster confusion matrix don \u2019 t contain such neurons , resulting in only 13 groups present in the MEI matrix . The motivation for that is that the MEIs are most informative for well-predicted neurons . The cluster confusion matrix shows all 100 GMM clusters , and the merging procedure with the 0.5 threshold is a heuristic to rearrange the rows and columns to highlight the block structure in the matrix . We tried different threshold values and chose the value of 0.5 by visual inspection of the resulting block structure in the matrix and the corresponding MEIs . To provide a better intuition of how the threshold value affects the matrix , we have updated the paper to include Figures C1 and C2 . In Figure C1 we show the cluster confusion matrices resulting from starting the matrix in Figure 7 and merging the next three pairs of blocks with the highest correlations . We can see that such merges result in biggest blocks , which are not homogeneous ( e.g.block 5 after the third merge clearly exhibits a checkerboard pattern suggesting it contains sufficiently different GMM clusters , which we want to avoid within the same block ) . In Figure C2 we show the sequential splits of the three blocks ( which is equivalent to performing the initial merging procedure backwards starting from the matrix in Figure 7 ) . The split blocks shown are not the last ones merged before achieving the correlation threshold of 0.5 ( those are blocks 15 and 16 , each of which contains only two GMM cluster , but rather the ones merged before them , which we think are more illustrative for this figure ) . The examples of the MEIs of the split blocks are also shown . The split blocks seem to be correlated with the MEIs being sufficiently similar ( perhaps with the exception of blocks 9 and 10 ) . Generally speaking , it is hard to find an exact threshold value which works best . However , grouping the cluster confusion matrix allows us to control the granularity of the functional blocks of neurons to highlight the range of computations implemented by the neurons and produce hypotheses of functional cell types which can be tested by further analysis based on other biological evidence ( e.g.morphology or genetics ) ."}, {"review_id": "rklr9kHFDB-1", "review_text": "In this study, the authors develop a method to cluster cells in primary visual cortex (V1) based on the cells' responses to natural images. The method consists in three steps: - fit a rotation-equivariant convolutional neural network model to V1 cells (previously described in Ecker et al. 2019) - align all cells by choosing the rotation for each cell that minimizes overall distance between cells in feature space, so that the clustering is mostly blind to the orientation of the filters. - cluster the cells using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Although I find this article mostly well-written and the topic important, I cannot recommend acceptance because (1) the study does not make a significant contribution to our understanding of V1, (2) the main innovation in ML presented (alignment method) is quite specific and will thus not likely be of interest for the general audience of ICLR: (1) An important question in visual neuroscience is whether V1 cells form discrete functional clusters as opposed to a continuum. Another related question is whether these functional clusters correspond to distinct cell types characterized by specific wiring patterns, gene expression and/or morphology. The analyses performed do not answer any of these two questions: - the clustering model (GMM model) is not compared statistically to other models that would assume a continuous structure in the data (e.g. cells form a sparse continuous manifold in feature space). Although clusters do appear in the t-SNE visualization, this visualization does not provide statistical evidence that cells indeed form distinct clusters. - The correspondence of the proposed clusters to cell types with specific wiring patterns, gene expression and/or morphology is not established. To establish this correspondence would require further experiments, as acknowledged by the authors: \"To systematically classify the V1 functional cell types, these proposals need to be subsequently examined based on a variety of biological criteria reflecting the different properties of the neurons and the prior knowledge about the experiment\". (2) The alignment method, which consists in rotating the cells in feature space so that orientation is not a factor for subsequent clustering, is quite specific to the problem studied and likely not of interest for the general ICLR audience. Additional feedback: - Title: ROTATION-INVARIANT CLUSTERING OF FUNCTIONAL CELL TYPES IN PRIMARY VISUAL CORTEX => \"functional cell types\" is not adequate here, since the article does not establish the existence of functional cell types. Could be replaced with \"cell responses\". - Abstract: We apply this method to a dataset of 6000 neurons and provide evidence that discrete functional cell types may exist in V1. => this sentence is misleading, since no evidence for functional clusters is provided. - \"Thus, the network has learned an internal representation that allows constructing very similar functions in multiple ways\" => To avoid the caveat of redundant features, the authors could try to add a dimensionality bottleneck on feature space before readout. - \"Small values of \u03b2 incur a small cost for poor reconstructions resulting in small optimised values of T and over-smoothed aligned readouts.\" => A simulated annealing procedure (progressive increase of T during learning) could potentially allow the use of larger \u03b2 values here (i.e. less distortion of the filter). - The alignment procedure could lead to the emergence of spurious structure in the clustering. It would be important to control for this potential artifact by running the procedure on an unstructured synthetic dataset. - It is possible that the MEIs within clusters look more similar than they actually are, since the cells are fitted from the same common bank of features. It would be useful but maybe difficult to control for this. - It would be interesting to test the clustering procedure on a shuffled version of the readout weights (shuffle across features and V1 cells), so as to keep sparsity but not any other structure.

Your main point of contention appears to be a perceived lack of evidence for functional cell types . While we agree that we do not provide undeniable proof , we do believe that the clusters revealed in Fig.6 and the clear block-diagonal structure of the confusion matrices in Fig.7 constitute important pieces of evidence that at least suggest that functional cell types may exist . Assessing whether discrete clusters exist in a high-dimensional space is a notoriously difficult problem , for which no commonly accepted solution exists \u2013 or at least we are not aware of one . A statistical comparison of the Gaussian Mixture Model ( GMM ) against alternative density models representing a continuous structure could be useful to refute the hypothesis of functional cell types if good candidates for alternative models existed and such models yielded a higher likelihood . However , such comparisons would never be strong evidence in favor of discrete clusters , because one would have to test against all alternative models . In addition , it is not clear to us what a good alternative model would be . Thus , the question will necessarily have to be answered qualitatively to some extent , and \u2013 as you also acknowledge \u2013 verified by experiments . As these additional experiments are technically very challenging , they first require a very clear hypothesis , which is what the present paper provides . The experimental verification , however , is clearly beyond the scope of a conference paper .

We show examples of raw and aligned data as well as the t-SNE embeddings colored according to the GMM clustering . As the amount of noise increases , the t-SNE plots for the raw and the aligned data become increasingly similar . That suggests that despite some the overfitting to noise ( as shown in Fig.4 ) , the alignment procedure does not significantly affect the GMM clustering or the t-SNE embeddings of the unstructured data .
