They perform a comprehensive evaluation to show the benign test accuracy and attack success rate over the models in the connected path between pairs of models with the same or different properties, e.g., both are attacked, both are benign, one attacked and one benign, etc., where the connected path is learned using existing algorithms to find the high-accuracy path over two different models. Their evaluation suggests that in certain attack scenarios, exploring the mode connectivity could help find a model that has a high benign accuracy, while with a significantly lower attack success rate than the models at the end points. In general I like this paper. Although mode connectivity has been studied in the literature, to my knowledge, this is the first work to extensively study this topic in the context of attacks. An interesting part of the paper is their evaluation on backdoor attacks, where they show that with a very small number of training samples for fine-tuning, they are able to find a model with decent test accuracy, while the watermarks are removed. Meanwhile, the attacks studied in this work include various settings, i.e., poisoning attacks, error-injection attacks, evasion attacks, and also adaptive attacks where the adversary knows that the defender will use path connection to improve the robustness. These make this paper a good reference as a systematic study of their proposed topic. However, my main question is that while the algorithm is pretty effective to defend against backdoor attacks and error-injection attacks, the results of evasion attacks are somehow negative. While it is helpful to show negative results if this is indeed the case, do you have some possible explanation why the models on the path are less robust than the two end models? Another concern is that while the benign test accuracy of the model found by their algorithms looks good, both CIFAR-10 and SVHN evaluated in this paper have a small label set and may not be challenging enough. It would be great if the authors can provide some results on a more complicated image recognition benchmark, e.g., some intermediate-level datasets studied in previous work on attacks such as CIFAR-100. ------------- Post-rebuttal comments I thank the authors for clarifying my questions, and I keep my original score. ------------", "rating": "8: Accept", "reply_text": "We thank the reviewer for the valuable review comments and suggestions . The finding in Figure 4 that the models on the path are less robust than the two end models against evasion attack can be explained by the fact that we use standard loss to train the path connection , which may find models that are less robust if the robust loss is not considered for path training . On the other hand , as discussed in Appendix M and shown in Figure A14 , if we use robust loss for path training ( which we call the robust connection method ) , we may be able to find more robust models on the path .

The goal of the method is to repair tampered networks using a limited number of clean data examples. The authors consider two types of adversarial attacks: backdoor attacks and error-injection attacks. The proposed method takes two potentially tampered networks, then constructs a low-loss path connecting the weight vectors of the given models in the space of network parameters (the path is constructed using the small set of clean data examples), finally an intermediate point on the path is used as a weight vector corresponding to the \u201crepaired\u201d model. The authors analyze the properties of the paths and show that intermediate points on the mode-connecting paths deliver both high clean-data accuracy and low attack success rate. In the experiments the proposed method shows better results compared to baseline defense techniques including fine-tuning, training from scratch, and pruning followed by fine-tuning. The paper also analyzes evasion adversarial attacks from the perspective of mode-connectivity and observes the existence of barriers in the landscape of robustness loss on the paths connecting regular and adversarially-trained models. I would like to note that the text of the paper is well-structured and clear. Another strength of paper is that the authors consider multiple supporting experimental settings and extensions of the proposed method. The considered cases include adaptive attacks (the settings in which the attacker is aware about the employed defense method). Although there are many strong sides of this paper, I have identified several serious flaws in the justification of the approach and the results. Thus, I consider the paper to be marginally below the acceptance threshold. I am willing to increase the score if the authors address my concerns expressed below. 1) What is the conceptual difference between using mode-connectivity and fine-tuning? Both methods try to find a point in the weight space which (1) is close to the initial point and (2) delivers low loss on the bonafide data. What feature of the proposed method can explain its success? The \u201ctechnical explanations\u201d for the effectiveness of the proposed path connection method only show that the random sampling procedure fails to find models with high-clean-accuracy and low-attack-accuracy. However, this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that fine-tuning (which performs directed search) cannot find models which perform similarly to the models found by the proposed method (potentially the hyperparameters of the fine-tuning procedure can be tuned better). Given the aforementioned similarity of the proposed approach and fine-tuning, the explanation (either theoretical or empirical) for the effectiveness of the proposed method has to be provided in order to motivate the methodological proposal of the paper. 2) Please report the error bars of the accuracy computed over multiple runs of the experiments (according to Appendix E multiple runs were performed, but only the mean values of the accuracy are reported). Including the error bars would help to quantify the statistical significance of the results. 3) What strategy was used to choose the parameter t? The parameter has different values depending on the model/dataset. How should this value be chosen in general? 4) In the formulation of Proposition 1 it is first stated (assumption (c)) that the directions of the gradient w.r.t. x and the vector v are aligned (the normalized dot product of the vectors is >= c), however then the proposition requires that the vectors must be similar. Why assumption (c) has to be included in this formulation, if the proposition also requires a stronger condition? Either the assumptions or the claim of the proposition has to be formulated clearly. For example, it can be explicitly stated that the proportionality holds approximately (up to terms which go to 0 as c goes to 1). I also recommend to include a term which accounts for the tail of the Taylor expansion in equation A4 instead of using the \u201capproximately equals\u201d sign. Moreover, I recommend to include the discussion of the effect of this tail term on the proof and the statement of the preposition.

Which part of the dataset was used for finding the path connections? How the \u201ctest data\u201d, which is claimed to be used for finding paths, is different from the test set used to evaluate the accuracy of the models?
