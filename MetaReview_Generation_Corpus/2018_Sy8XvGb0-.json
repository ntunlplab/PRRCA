Starting from a VAE trained with an emphasis on good reconstructions (and at the expense of sample quality, via a small hard-coded standard deviation on the conditional p(x | z)), the authors propose to train two \"critic\" networks on the latent representation: 1. The \"realism\" critic receives either a sample z ~ q(z) (which is implicitly defined as the marginal of q(z | x) over all empirical samples) or a sample z ~ p(z) and must tell them apart. 2. The \"attribute\" critic receives either a (latent code, attribute) pair from the dataset or a synthetic (latent code, attribute) pair (obtained by passing both the attribute and a prior sample z ~ p(z) through a generator) and must tell them apart. The goal is to find a latent code which satisfies both the realism and the attribute-exhibiting criteria, subject to a regularization penalty that encourages it to stay close to its starting point. It seems to me that the proposed realism constraint hinges exclusively on the ability to implictly capture the marginal distribution q(z) via a trained discriminator. Because of that, any autoencoder could be used in conjunction with the realism constraint to obtain good-looking samples, including the identity encoder-decoder pair (in which case the problem reduces to generative adversarial training). I fail to see why this observation is VAE-specific. The authors do mention that the VAE semantics allow to provide some weak form of regularization on q(z) during training, but the way in which the choice of decoder standard deviation alters the shape of q(z) is not explained, and there is no justification for choosing one standard deviation value in particular. With that in mind, the fact that the generator mapping prior samples to \"realistic\" latent codes works is expected: if the VAE is trained in a way that encourages it to focus almost exclusively on reconstruction, then its prior p(z) and its marginal q(z) have almost nothing to do with each other, and it is more convenient to view the proposed method as a two-step procedure in which an autoencoder is first trained, and an appropriate prior on latent codes is then learned. In other words, the generator represents the true prior by definition. The paper is also rather sparse in terms of comparison with existing work. Table 1 does compare with Perarnau et al., but as the caption mentions, the two methods are not directly comparable due to differences in attribute labels. Some additional comments: - BiGAN [1] should be cited as concurrent work when citing (Dumoulin et al., 2016). - [2] and [3] should be cited as concurrent work when citing (Ulyanov et al., 2016). Overall, the relative lack of novelty and comparison with previous work make me hesitant to recommend the acceptance of this paper.

Since the marginal posterior , q ( z ) , corresponds to real datapoints , we consider \u201c realism \u201d to be a fair name for an implicit constraint that makes samples more similar to q ( z ) . As we note in the future work section , there are other ways to constrain sampling to the marginal posterior , such as learning an explicit autoregressive density model ( indeed , van den Oord et al.proposed just such an approach in their very recent paper \u201c Neural Discrete Representation Learning \u201d , although they argued that using discrete latent variables was essential to their success ) . We feel that combining these approaches is an interesting avenue to consider , but for simplicity we focused on implicit constraints . > \u201c The regularisation term L_dist , why this and not log ( 1 + exp ( z ' - z ) ) ( or many arbitrary others ) ? \u201d The form of L_dist was inspired by the log-density of a student-t distribution , which we chose because it penalizes outliers less than the more obvious MSE regularizer ( we found MSE regularization to be quite sensitive to the hyperparameter lambda_dist ) . There are indeed a number of other similarly heavy-tailed functions that could work ; we did not experiment extensively with these , but a better choice may well exist . > \u201c The claim of identity preservation is ( to me ) a strong one : it would truly be hard to minimise the trajectory distance wrt . the actual 'identity ' of the subject. \u201d Indeed , without conditioning on explicit labels it is hard to rigorously define identity preservation , let alone enforce it . We use the phrase \u201c identity preserving \u201d to emphasize that we are trying to match not only attributes , but also whatever other latent structure was discovered by the unconditional generative model . Empirically , we feel this approach produces results that , while not perfect , match intuitive notions of identity preservation much better than models that only attempt to match attributes . > \u201c For Figure 6 I would prefer a different colourscheme : the red does not show up well on screen. \u201d Point well taken . We \u2019 ve changed to grey so that it looks like an extension of the black keys on the piano and contrasts more with the red notes which are out of the key of C ."}}
